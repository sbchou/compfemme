M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	Sarah Rose knows you're a beautiful person....
M	MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER	Sarah Rose knows you have an unusual talent. Sarah Rose knows you're a teenage girl.
M	MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER	Mmm, and she definitely knows that you are ready for the ultimate teen glamour.
M	MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER	The American Teen Princess Pageant.
M	MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER	And now, a few words...
M	MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER	...from last year's host, Mr. Adam West.
M	ADAM WEST	The American Teen Princess Pageant has been enriching the lives of American-made girls since 1945.
M	ADAM WEST	The American Teen Princess Pageant provides personal growth, scholarship, travel, and you...
M	ADAM WEST	...might even meet a few celebrities. At the national level, thousands of seventeen year-old girls like yourselves, compete around the country in places like:
M	MALE PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	Beautiful Mount Rose, Minnesota.
M	ADAM WEST	And make it all the way here to Lincoln, Alabama, to compete for the title of American Teen Princess.
M	ADAM WEST	And now, a few words from last year's host, Mr. Adam West.
M	ADAM WEST	So, which one of you will it b --
M	GLADYS LEEMAN	Good God, Iris, you taped your shows over it.
F	IRIS	Sorry.
M	GLADYS LEEMAN	Now ladies, the rest of the tape -- which is now gone forever -- goes on about startin' this great American journey we call American Teen Princess... Yah-so, any of you young ladies who'd like to start on that journey, you just come right down here and sign up. And please... help yourselves to some coffee and bars...
F	GLADYS	Showtime.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
F	GLADYS	Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
F	IRIS	What's sick is women dressin' like men!
F	GLADYS	Uh... You betcha, Iris. Yah -- I think yous boys'll find that things are different here in Mount Rose...
F	GLADYS	For one thing, y'know, we're God fearin' folk -- every last one of us...
F	GLADYS	You won't find a back room in our video store...
F	GLADYS	...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
F	IRIS	A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
M	ELDERLY MAN (MAYOR)	Oh, yah-sure, Freda, yah. She was the oldest livin' Lutheran. Now she's dead as a doornail. It's them damn Shriners who ain't taken that Goddamn sign down yet -- those lazy sons-a- bitches... I tells 'em, I tells 'em every goddamn year, "Take the Goddamn Freda sign down, you lazy sons-a- bitches!"
F	GLADYS	trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
F	IRIS	Nothin' too showy!
F	GLADYS	Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
F	IRIS	Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
F	GLADYS	Oh, my! Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
F	GLADYS	Iris, stop! It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
F	IRIS	That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
F	IRIS	Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
F	GLADYS	You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
F	IRIS	It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
F	GLADYS	I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
F	IRIS	All right, let's go.
F	GLADYS	Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! I just thought of the theme.
F	IRIS	Oh! What is it?
F	GLADYS	"Proud... to be... an... American."
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
F	GLADYS	Last year? It was, "Buy American."
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	And the year before that?
F	GLADYS	"U.S.A. is A-okay."
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
F	GLADYS	"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
M	LESLIE MILLER	...Hi. I'm Leslie Miller. I'm signin' up k'cause -- ah, y'know, I always watch pageants on the TV and my boyfriend thinks I'll win.
M	LESLIE MILLER	For my talent, I'm gonna be doing the..
F	LESLIE	Uh, Pat, I'm trying to tell themabout my... Oh...
M	LESLIE MILLER	Hi, Pat! Go, Muskies! Whoo!
M	AMBER ATKINS	Hi, I -- I'm Amber Atkins and, um, I'm signin' up k'cause, ah, my two favorite people in the world competed. My mom and Diane Sawyer... Course I hope I end up a little more like Diane Sawyer than my mom...
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	Do you do any of the, uh, embalming?
F	AMBER	Oh, my God, no. Oh, God. I just do the hair and makeup on the deceased.
M	AMBER (V.O.)	I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
F	GLADYS	Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
F	BECKY	Is this my mark? Hi, I'm Rebecca Leeman. And I believe this pageant is an important experience for every young woman. It, well, it teaches you what's really important in life, and it has the power to change you in ways you've never dreamed of.
F	BECKY	...What?! Klinghagen thinks it'll all come down to me and Amber?
F	BECKY	Well, you have to take everything Mrs. Klinghagen says with a grain of salt. Not all your Catholics go to communion for the wafers, if you know what I mean...
F	BECKY	...Yah -- my mom gave me this nine- mil for my thirteenth birthday...
F	BECKY	I aim to win.
F	LISA	Why? Well, uh, it's kind of like askin', "Why do all the guys chew Copenhagen?" You know? I mean, if you're seventeen and you're not a total fry, it's just what you do. Have you decided what your talent is going to be yet?
F	LISA	I'm gonna sing and dance to, "New York, New York." See, I fell in love with The Big Apple last summer when I was visitin' my brother. He followed his dream to New York.
F	LISA	This is Peter as Liza. This is him as Madonna. Oh, here's me with him as Barbara...
F	TESS	Uh... I don't know what my talent's gonna be yet...
F	TESS	Kenny. Kenny, come. Come, Kenny.
F	TESS	This is Kenny. Spike, my German Shepherd, went to live with a nice family on a farm after he attacked me. It wasn't his fault. I had beef jerky in my front pocket. They re-made my belly with skin from my butt.
M	IONA HILDERBRANTDT	I was Mount Rose American Teen Princess in 1945. We were at war with the Japs.
M	IONA HILDERBRANTDT (V.O.)	I didn't even get to keep my damn tiara.
M	IONA HILDERBRANTDT	Had to turn it in for scrap.
F	MR. HOWARD	...So we adopt Molly three year ago when we come to America, to help acclimate us to American.
F	MOLLY	To America, Dad.
F	MRS. HOWARD	She all-American girl. She our American Teen Princess girl.
F	MOLLY	Oh, Mom...
F	TINA	Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
F	MR. HOWARD	English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
F	TINA	I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
F	MR. HOWARD	Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
F	MRS. HOWARD	"Robert," settle down.
F	MR. HOWARD	AHHHHHH!
F	TINA	Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
F	MR. HOWARD	No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
F	TINA	Oh, I almost forgot... I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
F	MR. HOWARD	What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP! Cut her outta this!
F	MR. HOWARD	Now Molly, tell movie man what you talent do.
F	MOLLY	I'll be line dancin'.
F	MR. HOWARD	Country western!
F	MRS. HOWARD	Clint Black! Ruff!
F	MR. HOWARD	Hey, what he got I not got?
F	MICHELLE	...Yah -- I'll be performing a dramatic monologue.
F	MICHELLE	Right now, I'm thinkin' "Othello" or... "Soylent Green." Lots of girls make a smooth transition from pageants into actin', y'know.
F	CONNIE	Competin' for the title of Minnesota's American Teen Princess sure was excitin'. But, I never coulda won without my...
F	CONNIE	St. Paul Pork Products!
F	CONNIE	I've been enjoyin' St. Paul Pork Products for years. I grew up right next to these stock yards.
F	CONNIE	It's still the same family-run business that Walter and Vera Polarski started in 1920 when they raised and slaughtered their first pig.
F	CONNIE	Mmm-mmmm. I just love St. Paul Pork Products. In fact, I love 'em so much
F	CONNIE	I work here now!
M	JANELLE	...My talent will be an interpretive dance while I sing, "Through the Eyes of Love." I have a dream of spreadin' sign language around the world... Mom? Would you be so kind?
M	JANELLE	Yeah. Well, see, uh, I have a dream of spreading sign language around the world. Mom, would you be so kind.
M	TAMMY CURRY	Tammy Curry. I'm signin' up for the scholarship'n'all.
M	TAMMY CURRY	...This one's for Varsity Soccer, uh, I'm captain. I run track, and, uh... Right here, I'm the new President of the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club...
M	TAMMY CURRY	I love that one.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (V.O.)	Would you say you have a good chance to win this pageant?
M	TAMMY (V.O.)	Yeah, you bet I do. I mean, maybe other people think I can't win a beauty pageant. But other people didn't think I could beat out Becky Leeman for President of the gun club, either. And I did. I -- I -- It's just like Anthony Robbins says, "I'm a winner. Nobody can stop me but me!"
F	GLADYS	Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
F	IRIS	It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
F	GLADYS	You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
F	IRIS	Yeah.
M	FEMALE MOURNER #1	May I have a tissue?
F	GLADYS	But the show must go on. I gotta get a hold of Ted and ask him if we can use that barn light as a spot again. So you watch the Jell- o salad, okay?
F	IRIS	All right. Okay.
M	FRY GIRL #1	...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
M	PREGNANT FRY GIRL (O.S.)	Tammy Curry?
M	FRY GIRL #1	Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
M	PREGNANT FRY GIRL	This pageant's like a roach motel.
M	FRY GIRL #1	Girls check in, but they don't check out.
M	PREGNANT FRY GIRL	Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
M	FRY GIRL #1	Yeah.
F	CHLORIS	And tendu. Close. Tendu. Close. Tendu. Close. Plie. And repeat. Suck in the belly, girls, and tuck in the tushes!
F	CHLORIS	Close those legs! You look like a bunch of bowlegged cows! Other side. And... tendu. Close. Tendu. Close. Tendu. Close. Plie.
F	CHLORIS	Yeah, you boys sure picked a good year. If I was a betting woman, and there was a line on this in Vegas, I'd lay down ten-to-one that it all comes down to Amber Atkins and Becky Leeman. Oh, sweet Jesus, what a showdown this could be if Cain and Abel...
F	LISA	Ow! Oh, God. It's so em -- so embarrassing.
M	MARY (V.O.)	My winning... the Mount Rose...
F	MARY	...American Teen Princess Pageant...
F	MARY	...really changed my life.
F	MARY	...Amber does my hair... once a week.
F	AMBER	Well... it's the least I can do for the reigning Mount Rose Junior Miss Amer --
F	AMBER	Oh God...
F	MARY	What?
F	AMBER	Huh? Oh... Uh, just a little snarl...
F	AMBER	There we go.
F	MARY	Beautiful... Maybe next week... a perm.
F	AMBER	Yah... sure...
F	BECKY	Hellooo, Little Mary Sunshine! What?! Oh -- oh my God! Lights! Camera! And me without a stitch of make-up on. What are you guys doin' here?
F	AMBER	What're you doin' here?
F	BECKY	Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
F	MARY	Who are you?
F	BECKY	"Who are you?!" Oh Mary, you kill me. She always says that. It's a little game we play. Every week -- same dippy little look on her face. "Who are you -- who are you?" Just like that. It's me -- Becky -- and I brought your favorites.
F	AMBER	How nice, Becky, she's anorexic.
F	BECKY	She's skinny, not deaf, Amber.
F	AMBER	...Dreams? Yah-sure I got 'em... Sometimes I dream of winnin'... I dream of gettin' outta Mount Rose and bein' a big time reporter like Diane Sawyer. I mean, guys get outta Mount Rose all the time for hockey scholarships or prison. But the pageant's kinda my only chance.
F	AMBER	...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times. Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
F	AMBER	That's my mom. I'll get 'em in a sec.
F	ANNETTE	Oh shit!
F	AMBER	They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
F	ANNETTE	Oh... How quickly they grow up. Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
F	ANNETTE	And go get my smokes!
M	LESTER	...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
F	GLADYS	Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
M	LESTER	Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
F	GLADYS	We're not in the showroom, Dear.
M	LESTER	Fits three full-size booze bottles. The cassette deck pulls outta Afghanistan, there.
F	BECKY	Mommm...
F	GLADYS	Lester?
M	LESTER	Oh, all right How soon they forget where all this comes from.
F	BECKY	Japan.
M	LESTER	That's enough, young lady.
F	GLADYS	"Impartial?" Outside this house I'm Gladys Leeman, President, Civil Servettes -- impartial as the day is long. But we're inside my home now and I've gotta warn you, I'm wearin' my "wife apron" and "mom hat." So, I can safely say that I'm the mother of the most talented contestant Mount Rose has ever seen.
F	GLADYS	I'll field that one -- Rebecca's saving her voice.
F	GLADYS	You-betcha, Rebecca's ready. She's been singin' and dancin' since she was knee high to a pig's eye.
M	LESTER	Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
F	GLADYS	Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
M	LESTER	Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
F	BECKY	Nice one, Dad. He's dead.
F	GLADYS	...Yah-then, for the "Judges Interview," each girl has a ten minute get-together with the judges before the pageant...
F	GLADYS	Yes, the Judges Interview... Each girl has a ten minute get-together with the judges prior to the pageant. Then we have the...
F	GLADYS	Hello, Tony.
M	TONY	Hey.
F	GLADYS	"Hey" to the folks.
M	TONY	Yeah, all right.
F	IRIS	The Judges Interview.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	So you've, uh, you've judged a lot of pageants over the years?
M	JOHN	Nope. No. Uh-uh. Never judged a pageant before in my life. Nope. No way. Never around young girls. Even if I was, why would I wanna be, y'know? I -- I -- I don't get off on that kinda thing and that's really why you're askin', right? S-someone say somethin'? Do you judge the pageant every year?
M	HAROLD	...Nope. Never judged nothin' afore --
M	HANK	Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
M	HAROLD	Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
M	HANK	Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
M	HAROLD	Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
M	HANK	I will if you shut your piehole.
M	HAROLD	Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	So are you excited?
M	HAROLD	...Oh you betcha! We're happier than the day Hanky got acquitted. I get made a judge, then the furniture store hires us to paint the whole damn thing. We're gonna use the money to get our mamma a proper headstone. Oh, and move her out to the cemetery.
M	LESTER	Hey Tim, Carla -- if yous kids don't try to Jew me down none, I'll throw in a matchin' hutch.
M	LESTER	See, that there's my specialty. Don't pay me less and I'll give ya more. Secret is, the hutch is included in the price. Ain't that right, Jean?
M	LESTER	Take a memo, sweetheart.
F	CHLORIS	Four, five, six, seven. And one.
F	CHLORIS	Put that chair away! Get it! Come on! Get it!
F	CHLORIS	All right. Let's go. Let's go.
M	JOHN	I'm just out here watching the young girls -- contestants -- like the rest of my friends and neighbors...
M	PAT	Are you gettin' her? Uh, the third one, the blonde one.
M	BRETT	Hey.
M	PAT	See? Right over there. Right over there.
M	BRETT	Leave him alone, leave him alone. It's okay.
M	JOHN	Oh, this is just a... camera. I keep it in the glove compartment for car accidents. Insurance... You guys got a camera and no one's accusin' you of anything, right?
F	BECKY	So, Brett, do you wanna go to the lake with me on Thursday?
M	BRETT	Um, actually, I got practice on Thursday.
F	BECKY	...Yah-well, maybe Friday, then. A bunch of us were gonna go cow-tippin'.
M	BRETT	Uh, I -- uh -- I'm kinda busy Friday.
M	BRETT	Hi...
F	AMBER	Hi.
F	BECKY	Giver her your tray, Brett. You're holdin' up the line.
M	BRETT	Uh...
F	BECKY	Give it to her!
F	AMBER	Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
M	BRETT	It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
F	AMBER	Well, you're supposed to put it in the...
M	BRETT	Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
F	AMBER	Then it must be Wednesday.
F	IONA	Leutefisk is Cod Fish that's been salted and soaked in lye for a week or so. It's best with lots-a butter.
M	BRETT	So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
F	AMBER	I know.
M	BRETT	So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
M	AMBER/BRETT	Huntin' season.
M	BRETT	Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
F	AMBER	Yah-sure, fine... fine.
M	BRETT	Okay... well, bye.
F	AMBER	Bye.
F	AMBER	Oh, God -- you don't think Becky saw you guys, do you? Look, you just shouldn't be in here... It's okay. Doreen gave us hair nets.
F	AMBER	No, listen. We shouldn't talk here. Stop by my house tonight, okay?
F	LORETTA	What do you mean, they take out her butt?
F	ANNETTE	Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
F	LORETTA	Are we on "Cops" again?
F	ANNETTE	You could be quiet.
F	LORETTA	Hi.
F	ANNETTE	Hi.
F	ANNETTE	It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
F	LORETTA	Oh, naw. Hi.
F	ANNETTE	This here's Loretta.
F	LORETTA	I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall." You guys want a beer?
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	No, thank you. Is Amber here?
F	ANNETTE	No. You just missed her. Amber got called in to the bone gardens tonight. You just missed her. She's in a helluva mood today, anyways.
F	LORETTA	Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
F	ANNETTE	Loretta, shut it.
F	LORETTA	Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
F	ANNETTE	Shut it up, Loretta.
F	LORETTA	Oh, Christ, it's true.
F	LORETTA	Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
F	ANNETTE	Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
F	LORETTA	She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
F	ANNETTE	"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
F	LORETTA	Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here. Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
F	ANNETTE	I'll be right back. See ya later.
F	ANNETTE	They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
F	LORETTA	All right, they're makin' a movie.
F	ANNETTE	You don't know where this is gonna...
F	LORETTA	I got a hairdo. What makes you think that Becky's going to win?
F	LORETTA	Why do I think Becky'll win? You're talkin'... Don't pinch! You're talkin' 'bout the richest family in a small town. It's front page news when one of 'em takes a shit. Can one of yous boys give me a ride home?
F	ANNETTE	Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
F	LORETTA	So? Be real easy.
F	ANNETTE	Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
F	LORETTA	Anyone?
F	AMBER	Ahhh! Je-sus-Christ-on-a-cross! Look, number one rule in a funeral home -- never sneak up on the livin'. You never know who could have an embalming needle or skull saw in their hand. Mr. Larson's son learned that the hard way -- he's buried next to my Grandpa!
F	AMBER	Upset about Brett? Nah. Hazard of the trade. I don't really have time for guys anyways. It's weird, though. He took it right between the eyes. Don't often see that.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	So you know, Brett just got shot in the head.
F	BECKY	He did? Well, huntin's dangerous... So, anyways, my mom gave me this 30- aught for my sixteenth birthday...
M	MR. LARSON	Amber, I need Stella now!
M	MR. LARSON	The family's steamin' like a cow pie in July. Said she didn't look nothin' like the picture they gave you.
F	AMBER	Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
M	MR. LARSON	Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother." The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
F	AMBER	-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
F	AMBER	Sorry I couldn't talk today 'cause... I'm scared, okay? I open my locker right after first period and there's a picture of Tammy Curry taped inside.
F	AMBER	This was written on back.
M	TWIN OFFICER #1	Oh-yah, helluva way to go, there. After some extensive investigation, we figure the Curry girl musta been drivin' and smokin' and KABLEWEY!
M	TWIN OFFICER #2	Not enough left of her to fill a tin.
F	AMBER	Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her dad's thresher -- she said the heavy vibration helped her think, y'know? But I know for a fact she only smoked after a good drive. You ask me or anyone else who isn't scared to talk about it -- Tammy was murdered. God, I bet Diane Sawyer never had to deal with crap like this... Toss me "Caucasian #5," would ya?
F	AMBER	Man, I can't wait for fishin' season...
M	MR. LARSON	Amber...
F	AMBER	No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
F	AMBER	I'm gonna need more caps.
M	MR. LARSON	You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
F	AMBER	Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
M	MR. LARSON	No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
F	AMBER	Oh my God -- no! Is my mom okay? Was she home?
F	AMBER	Mom! Mom!? MOMMMM!
M	FIREMAN #1	You family?
F	LORETTA	No, she's just screamin' "Mom, Mom!" 'cause she's got Tourettes... She's Annette's kid, dipshit.
F	AMBER	Is Mom okay?
F	LORETTA	She's alive, sweetie.
F	AMBER	Where is she?!
F	LORETTA	She's right over there.
F	AMBER	Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
F	LORETTA	Don't let that worry you, Annette!
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	So, doctor, is this sort of an unusual injury here?
M	DOCTOR	Oh you betcha, this was a doozy. Right now, our chief concern is to stabilize Annette, then, in surgery, remove this here.
F	AMBER	Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
F	ANNETTE	Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons. Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
M	ROCKER KID #1	Yah-dude, put another fuckin' book under it.
M	ROCKER KID #2 (O.S.)	Don't say "fuckin'." My ma's got the windows open.
M	ROCKER KID #2	kKay-dude, hurry. We gots like two fuckin' minutes left on the battery.
M	ROCKER KID #1	A one... two... one-two-three...
M	ROCKER KIDS	SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!
F	ANNETTE	I shoved your tap shoes in my jeans before I was blown outta the house, Honey. Check with the guy who cut my pants off. He should have 'em.
F	AMBER	Mom, uh, about that... I -- I'm -- oh God...
F	ANNETTE	Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant! If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
F	LORETTA	Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
F	LORETTA	You're what?!
F	AMBER	I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
F	LORETTA	I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
F	AMBER	Oh God, I'm dead...
M	CANDY STRIPER	Hey, lil' Miss Sad-pants and her friend Serious Sally, how 'bout some nice cool mints to turn those frowns upside-down. "S."
F	LORETTA	D'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if I shoved your head up your ass?
F	AMBER	So, what do I say?
F	LORETTA	Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
F	AMBER	Oh my God. I'm so dead...
F	LORETTA	Yeah, you betcha...
F	ANNETTE	Go on! Get out!
F	AMBER	Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
F	AMBER	Mom!
F	ANNETTE	I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
F	AMBER	Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
F	ANNETTE	What?!
F	AMBER	Ow!
F	ANNETTE	Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
F	AMBER	Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
F	ANNETTE	You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
F	AMBER	Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
F	ANNETTE	Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
F	AMBER	That's it, I'm goin'...
F	ANNETTE	Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
F	AMBER	God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
F	ANNETTE	It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
F	ANNETTE	C'mere. I love you so much.
F	AMBER	I love you much.
F	LORETTA	Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
F	AMBER	No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him. So has your mom kept your dad's life a secret?
F	AMBER	No. She never hid the fact that my dad picked his career over us. What'd she used to say?
F	LORETTA	"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
F	AMBER	Oh-yah.
M	TWIN OFFICER #1	The Atkins fire? Foul play? Shit-no. After some thorough investigatin', we determined it musta been a bad wirin'. Mosta them trailer-folk plug a TV, VCR, crock pot and Fry-daddy into one outlet and don't think nothin' of it ktil KABLEWEY!
M	TWIN OFFICER #2	Not enough left to fill a tin.
F	ANNETTE	"Bad wirin'?!" Well, if that ain't the biggest crock-a-shit ever. Ooowwww-Jesus! Did K-Mart have a sale on dull needles?
M	CANDY STRIPER	I -- I just need one more "do-over."
F	GLADYS	So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
F	IRIS	Okay, everybody, listen up!
F	GLADYS	Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
F	GLADYS	Excuse me, Miss Penthouse Ninety- eight, put your knees together. I could drive a boat show in there.
F	GLADYS	Ankles together. Hands resting lightly on your laps. Good. Sit up straight. Smile!
F	GLADYS	All right. Number two: the judges are as nervous as you are.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	So are you about ready to start the judging -- start the interview, there?
M	JOHN	Uh, I -- I guess I could answer that. Yep. We're ready. So, we should probably get the young girls in here, then. Y'know, to start the interviews...
M	HAROLD	Uh, "if you could be any tree in the woods, what kinda tree would you be?"
F	TESS	Dogwood.
F	MOLLY	Bonsai.
F	LESLIE	Green?
F	MICHELLE	A tree? I can be any tree you want. Gimme a minute.
F	BECKY	One with strong roots in a community like Mount Rose, a solid Christian trunk and long leafy branches to provide shade for handicapped kids on a hot summer day.
F	LISA	You guys know the retard's pants are open? I don't want to see that.
M	HAROLD	"Who would you pick to be president, dead or alive?"
F	MOLLY	Uh, Emperor Hirohito.
F	LESLIE	Brett Favre!
F	BECKY	My mother, 'cause she could solve world hunger with one of her blue- ribbon rhubarb pies, create world peace with one of her prayers and still find time to look beautiful... for my dad, Lester Leeman.
M	JOHN	D -- do you like to swim?
F	LISA	Oh-yah, I love to swim. When I was in New York, I met Greg Louganis at one-a my brothers' shows...
M	JOHN	What the hell is she trying to say? Say it!
M	JANELLE	The ktards pants are completely off!
M	HAROLD	Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
M	HANK	Harold!
M	HAROLD	Close up shop!
M	HAROLD	You Amber Atkins? Yes. Yes I am. Thank you, hello.
M	HAROLD	"Name and spell all the United States in alphabetical order."
F	AMBER	Seriously?
M	HAROLD (O.S.)	Ah-yep.
F	AMBER	Well, ah... Alabama. A-L-A-B-A-M-A. Alaska. A-L-A-S-K-A. Arizona. A-R-I- Z-O-N-A.
F	AMBER	West Virginia. W-E-S-T-V-I-R-G-N-I- A. Wisconsin. W-I-S-C-O-N-S-O-N. Wyoming. W-Y-O-M-I-N-G.
M	HAROLD	Uh-okay, then.
F	MARY	With two weeks until the pageant... I was practicing my talent. Finishing my costume, brushing up on current events, and running eighteen miles a day on about four hundred calories. I was ready.
F	IRIS	Coupla things... Gladys wants to be sure we go in show order today. All right? So very important. Don't forget that.
F	LESLIE	Oh-yah, really nervous. It's been about two months. I haven't told my boyfriend yet. How did you know?
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	I meant, nervous about the pageant?
F	LESLIE	Oh! Nervous about the pageant! Yah sure!
F	BECKY	There are eight thousand sequins and fifteen hundred beads on the skirt, alone. My mom and Mrs. Lopez make it. She's one of my father's many Mexican (Me'hee'kan) workers he lifts from the poverty they know in Mexico (Me'heek'koe).
F	AMBER	Yah -- my ma's clothes all melted onto mine forming like this big polyester meteor in our closet, y'know? But, in some kinda weird miracle, our neighbor boy, Kenny Johanson, found my tap costume on the roof-a their trailer while he was settin' coon traps for his dad. Here's the weird part. It was still on the hanger.
F	TESS	And, uh, this is my lucky bolt. They think it fell from a DC-10. The doctor said I was lucky the flat side hit me, um, otherwise it coulda gone right through my head. I know, I know, gives me the willies, too. I guess the explosion...
M	JANELLE	Amber? Can we switch numbers? I need to go first. My cousin just had a deaf baby and I get to go see it!
F	AMBER	Yah-sure, eight's my luck number anyway. Diane Sawyer was number eight at her local.
M	JANELLE	Thank you.
F	GLADYS	I'll be honest. This is a hard time for me. This is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night, all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser. It's hard for me to know how that must feel, but I'm sure it doesn't feel good.
F	AMBER	Don't you get it? I was supposed to go first. I was contestant number one. That light was meant for my head. If Janelle hadn't wanted to change numbers... God, I owe my life to that deaf baby.
F	LORETTA	That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
F	AMBER	Really, Loretta?
F	LORETTA	You-betcha.
F	AMBER	My mom wanted me to have this?
F	LORETTA	Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
F	AMBER	Loretta, never have kids.
F	LORETTA	Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
F	LORETTA	Here, your ma did want you to have this since your other one got toasted and all.
F	AMBER	Oh... my... God! It's just like Diane Sawyer's! 'Course it's not a size ten, Diane was a little hippy back then. Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
M	MR. HOWARD/MRS. HOWARD	Go Molly! Go! Number one daughter!
M	PAT	Whooo! Leslie kicks Teen Princess ass! Go Muskies!
F	GLADYS	Welcome, welcome. Okay, alright, now. Is this for me or the gown?
F	GLADYS	Welcome to the Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant. While every contestant you'll meet tonight is special and unique, they all have one thing in common. They're all "Proud -- to -- be -- an -- American!"
F	BECKY	I chose Mount Rushmore, because to live in a country where you can take an ugly old mountain and put faces on it, faces of great Americans, who did so much to make our country super great, well that makes me -- Rebecca Leeman -- PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!
F	LISA	Living in a country where Lady Liberty keeps her flame burning bright.
F	LISA	Keeps her flame burning bright...
F	LESLIE	The Washington Monument...
F	LESLIE	...makes me, Leslie Miller, proud to be an American.
F	AMBER	Living in a country where no matter who you are or where you come from, you can grow up and become what you've always dreamed of, makes me, Amber Atkins, proud to be an American!
F	MOLLY	Atomic power makes me, Molly Howard, proud to be an Asian-American.
F	TESS	Uh, this, uh, my Uncle Phil's World's Largest Ball of Twine, in Bundy Minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me proud I'm American -- I kinda misunderstood the assignment.
F	IRIS	Okay, okay! Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal. Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
F	AMBER	Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
F	IRIS	Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
F	AMBER	No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
F	BECKY	What?
F	AMBER	You heard me. Where is it?
F	BECKY	If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
F	AMBER	I just did.
F	BECKY	Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
F	AMBER	Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
F	BECKY	Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
F	AMBER	Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
F	BECKY	If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
F	AMBER	Bitch!
F	IRIS	Girls! Girls!
F	BECKY	Give me your stringy-ass hair!
F	AMBER	I'll get you!
M	CREW GUY (O.S.)	Oh God, don't stop 'em now...
F	BECKY	You're choking my, you fucking bitch!
F	IRIS	Y'know, I -- I don't think yous boys should, uh, should be in here while the girls are changin'.
F	AMBER	I hate her!
F	IRIS	We all do. Now let's go.
F	GLADYS	Yah-so how 'bout a big round of applause for last year's Mount Rose American Teen Princess, in a farewell performance. Who could forget her lip-synching to "Don't Cry Out Loud," by Melissa Manchester. And here she is, Mary Johanson!
F	IRIS	All right, why don't we take up the stepladders, all right? For the Physical Fitness number?
F	BECKY	They're wet.
F	LISA	Hey, my hands are stuck.
F	MOLLY	Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes.
F	IRIS	Well, hold 'em away from you so it doesn't get on the outfits. What kinda mental retard paints step ladders the morning of a pageant.
M	HANK	Here come the judge -- pinch, pinch -- here come the judge -- pinch, pinch -- here come the judge...
F	GLADYS	Get back! Get back, you total retard!
F	LORETTA	Go Hank!
F	GLADYS	I'm okay, I'm okay -- dress is fine. I'm okay... well, our other judges are Jean Kangas and John Dough...
F	CHLORIS	Opening number looked, uh, good. Solid. But now you're gonna have to actually dance, so... Here. Put a dab of this on the old choppers, ladies. It'll help you smile. And when they're lookin' at your teeth -- God willin' -- they won't be lookin at your feet.
F	BECKY	Hurry up.
F	LESLIE	Okay, guys, I think we all got some. You just take it off.
F	AMBER	Here, I didn't get any.
F	LESLIE	Here, have some.
F	MICHELLE	Hand me another white one.
F	LISA	Listen, you guys, don't go into the bathroom. Tess blew chunks all over. Man, she ate a big dinner.
F	BECKY	Maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky bolt down her throat for desert.
F	AMBER	And the winner of the "Spirit" award goes to...
F	IRIS	"I'd like to take you back seventeen years, when a peanut farmer was in the White House, a group-a boys callin' themselves 'Queen' topped the record charts and Gladys Leeman was Gladys Wood and she was Mount Rose American Teen Princess!"
F	GLADYS	Thank you, thank you. You know, I won the talent contest by sewing these culottes, Butterick pattern 7- 4-3-2. Can you believe it? They still fit!
F	LORETTA	She had a big ass then, she's got a big ass now.
F	GLADYS	Thank you, thank you. Our next contestant is ready, so let's welcome her: Tess Weinhaus!
F	TESS	The beagle is known for it's howl. "Aaauuuuuhhhh." The Pekinese has it's own distinctive bark. "Yip, yip, yip." Not to be confused with the Chihuahua's, "Yap, yap, yap." But none can compare to the greatest bark of all -- the German Shepherd...
F	AMBER	...Yah -- it's just gone... I mean, I -- I just wanna tap, y'know? I'm not sayin' I'm the best, or that I'd even win, but shouldn't I at least get a chance to compete? I just wanted my Mom to see me dance.
F	CHLORIS	Amber -- Amber, c'mere.
F	AMBER	Please, Mrs. K, I got so much Vaseline on my teeth, I'm gonna be smilin' for a year.
F	CHLORIS	No. Here.
F	CHLORIS	It's nothin' special, but talent like yours doesn't need to hide behind sequins.
F	AMBER	Mrs. K --
F	CHLORIS	You're... you're special and... Ah hell, go out there and kick some Leeman ass.
F	CHLORIS	Not so hard, sweetie. I heard somethin' snap...
F	LESLIE	Roll him over -- Lay him flat Pin his shoulders To the mat Roll him over, lay him flat, pin his shoulders, to the mat! Yeahhhh!
F	MICHELLE	Fade in... Earth. The year is two- thousand twenty-four. The question on everyone's mind: What is... Soylent Green?
F	AMBER	Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
F	IRIS	Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
F	AMBER	But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
F	IRIS	Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
F	AMBER	This, this... This is bullshit!
F	IRIS	Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
F	AMBER	Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
F	IRIS	Where do they get this stuff...
F	AMBER	Mrs. Leeman?
F	GLADYS	Huh?
F	AMBER	I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
F	GLADYS	Oh really -- I don't think so. Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this... This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
F	AMBER	But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
F	MICHELLE	That's why... I must say... Soylent Green... is... people.
F	GLADYS	Oops, that's my cue.
F	MOLLY	Wish me luck.
F	AMBER	Good luck, Molly.
F	GLADYS	Thank you, Molly.
F	LISA	Oh, Amber...
F	AMBER	I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
F	LISA	I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
F	LISA	Amber? Here.
F	AMBER	"Here," wh-wh-what?
F	LISA	My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
F	MICHELLE	Oh man, Lisa, I wouldn't do this.
F	LESLIE	They're never gonna let you perform naked. I asked.
F	LISA	Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
F	AMBER	Your parents'd kill you.
F	LISA	Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
F	AMBER	Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
F	LISA	Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
F	AMBER	Yah?
F	LISA	Oh-you-beccha.
F	GLADYS	Now, it's with overwhelming pride that I introduce contestant number six, who also happens to be president of her class -- two years running -- a member of the honor roll and the new President of the Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club -- Rebecca Ann Leeman!
F	BECKY	I don't know how many of you know this, but I've got a very special fella in my life -- that's right, I do... And if nobody minds, I'd like to sing a little song, just for him.
F	BECKY	You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. You'd be like Heaven to touch. I wanna hold you so much. At long last love has arrived and I thank God I'm alive.
F	BECKY	You're just to good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you...
F	IRIS	C'mon, Lisa. You're up next.
F	LISA	I quit. And, uh, since my costume, y'know, was okay'd a month ago? I'm givin' it to Amber.
F	GLADYS	Boy, I'd hate to follow that. Wow!
F	GLADYS	Voice of an angel, that one.
F	GLADYS	...Uh, I was just told that contestant number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quit the pageant.
F	GLADYS	Well, these things happen. At any rate, we still have one more contestant -- number eight, Amber Atkins.
F	GLADYS	Okay, okay, okay! Well, now, it's finally time to say good-bye to our judges, so they can go make the toughest decision of their lives. So who get's the crown? How are you going to figure this all out?
M	JOHN	Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare scores and uh, figure out a-a winner. 'Cause we don't know the winner yet... I mean, I -- I don't know who Jean and Harold picked. No idea. Did Gladys send you in here?
M	HANK	I know the winner! I know the winner! I know the winner!
M	JOHN	No you don't! Shut your goddamn mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!!
M	HAROLD	Wait a second.
M	JOHN	You shut it! You goddamn retard!
M	HANK	EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
M	HAROLD	Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
M	JOHN	For fuck's sake, why didn't ya leave him with a sitter?
M	HAROLD	Real nice. You know the sitter's dead.
F	LESLIE	So, anyone talk to Janelle?
F	AMBER	Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
F	TESS	She's happy?
F	LESLIE	Why happy?
F	AMBER	Oh -- the blow to her head made her deaf...
F	BECKY	Oh, good Lord! What're they doin'? Lettin' the retard count votes?!
F	IRIS	It's time, ladies.
F	GLADYS	Welcome back, everyone. Judges. Our Second Runner-up and winner of a fifty --
M	PAT (O.S.)	You rule, Leslie!
F	GLADYS	Our next prize, a seventy-five dollar scholarship --
F	GLADYS	...will be awarded to the First Runner- up.
F	GLADYS	And the First Runner-up is -- Contestant number eight, Amber Atkins.
F	GLADYS	And finally, the moment I know I've been waiting for...
F	GLADYS	With a scholarship of five-hundred dollars, courtesy Leeman Furniture, and all expenses paid for next weekend when she'll be competin' for the title of Minnesota American Teen Princess...
F	GLADYS	Our new Mount Rose American Teen Princess is contestant number -- ah heck, she's my daughter -- number seven, Rebecca Ann Leeman!
F	BECKY	Oh, thank you so much!
F	ANNETTE	Shit.
M	ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR	"Here she is, Our Mount Rose American Teen Princess. Look at her, doesn't she look fine. Our hearts swell big, as we look at her. Our Mount Rose American Teen Princess."
F	ANNETTE	We was robbed.
F	LORETTA	Okay. Take her purse.
F	AMBER	Bye mom.
F	ANNETTE	We was robbed.
F	AMBER	It's okay.
F	AMBER	Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
F	LORETTA	Thank God for bunge cords.
F	AMBER	...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me. I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
F	LESLIE	Hey -- hey, I'm Second Runner-up! Whooo! I got second place!
M	PAT	Third.
F	LESLIE	Huh?
F	LISA	No, it was worth it. Amber shoulda won.
M	LISA'S FATHER	I'll tell ya one thing. Peter never woulda pulled a shenanigan like that.
F	LISA	Well, y'know what, dad? Y'know what? Peter's gay!
M	LISA'S FATHER	What?!
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	So, how does it feel to be the new Mount Rose American Teen Princess, Becky?
F	BECKY	Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
F	GLADYS	She's the winner and we're going to state. What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
M	PREGNANT FRY GIRL	I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	Are you ladies going to the parade tomorrow?
M	PREGNANT FRY GIRL	Nah. I think I'm like, due or somethin'.
M	LESTER	Ahhh. Beautiful as a whore's ass today. Eh, boys?
F	GLADYS	Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
M	LESTER	Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico (Me'hee'koe) in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos. Whoo, they love that.
M	MAYOR	Yah -- hello -- hello... shit! How the fuck do ya work this damn thing, huh? Oh. Welcome to our first ever American Teen Princess Parade -- which also happens to be the unveiling of our new sewer system!
M	MAYOR	Yah -- so, while Becky gets on her float, then, any questions 'bout the new sewer? Yah, Clem?
M	HAROLD	Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
M	HANK	I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
M	HAROLD	You get nothing, Hank, okay?
M	HANK	I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
M	HAROLD	There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
F	GLADYS	C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
F	BECKY	It smells funny. Like gasoline.
F	GLADYS	Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
F	BECKY	My dress'll reek.
F	GLADYS	Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
F	LESLIE	Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
F	AMBER	Yeah...
F	LESLIE	And the bite marks on my ears?
F	AMBER	Yes...
F	LESLIE	I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
F	AMBER	Yes, Leslie!
M	HANK	Help... Hank! Help... Hank! Help... Hank! Help... Hank!
F	GLADYS	Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
F	IRIS	Uh, Gladys?
F	GLADYS	What!
F	IRIS	We need more bars!
F	GLADYS	This is -- what?
F	IRIS	Enid ate a whole pan!
F	GLADYS	I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
F	AMBER	Oh-yah, this is exactly how I pictured it. Chokin' on swan gas.
F	GLADYS	Oh my God! My Baby! The swan ate my baby! Ow-ow-ow! Get up, Rebecca! Get outta there! We've gotta go to State! Oh hot! Oh, damn. I like this blouse. Rebecca! Get up, angel face. Time to go to State! Ow-ow-ow!
F	GLADYS	Get offa me, you cow!
F	GLADYS	What're you lookin' at? Huh? A whole God Damn town of losers! That's what I'm lookin' at!
F	GLADYS	You! You piece-a-shit trailer trash! This shoulda been you! Damn, I shoulda killed you when I had the...
F	GLADYS	Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
M	LESTER	Gladys! Stop it!
F	GLADYS	Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
F	GLADYS	Let go-a-me, you old bastard!
F	GLADYS	At least you've got another daughter.
M	LESTER	So help me, Gladys.
F	GLADYS	Becky was my only shot at state!
M	LESTER	That's enough!
F	GLADYS	Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
F	GLADYS	He sells reproductions! His furniture's as fake as my orgasms!
M	SCOTT	Hey, man, how're you doin'?
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	Hi! What's up, Scott? You remember Bruce, right?
M	SCOTT	Long time, no see.
M	DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)	Bruce, that's Roy. Roy, Bruce.
M	PASTOR	That's why, dear Lord, it's with such great sorrow that we turn over to you a young woman whose dream of ridin' on a giant swan brought about her untimely death. Maybe it's your way of telling us to buy American.
F	IRIS	As, uh, actin' President of the Mount Rose Civil Servettes, it's my duty since Becky can't fulfill her duties -- 'cause she's dead-n-all -- to make you Mount Rose American Teen Princess.
M	MALE REPORTER #1	Turn around and let me see.
F	LORETTA	What is wrong with you?
F	AMBER	I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
F	LORETTA	You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
F	AMBER	Really?
F	LORETTA	No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
F	AMBER	Okay.
F	LORETTA	Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
M	AMBER (V.O.)	I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
F	LORETTA	This came for you, sweetie.
F	AMBER	Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
F	AMBER	It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
F	LORETTA	What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
F	AMBER	I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
F	LORETTA	Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
F	AMBER	There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
F	AMBER	Oh crap -- I only got four days. I gotta practice!
F	LORETTA	All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
F	AMBER	Airport Ho-Jo!
F	LORETTA	I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
F	AMBER	Loretta, don't do that.
F	LORETTA	I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
F	AMBER	I gotta work with these women.
F	LORETTA	Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
F	TERRY	And you are...
F	AMBER	Mount Rose American Teen Princess.
F	TERRY	Funny, you don't look dead.
F	COLLEEN	Okay ladies, listen up. I'm Colleen Douglas and this raving beauty on my right --
F	TERRY	I'm a mirror.
F	COLLEEN	Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
F	TERRY	We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
F	COLLEEN	That's right.
F	TERRY	Okay?
F	COLLEEN	Mm-hm.
F	LORETTA	So... you're cute. Oh, I see you're married. You catch this in your mouth, I'll give you a present. All right? Open wide... Oh, God, you got that on the first try. Come here.
F	LORETTA	You are cute.
F	TERRY	Due to budgetary cutbacks -- and the fact that Nationals didn't cough up a damn nickel this year -- you won't be stayin' overnight. So pay attention, you've got about eight hours until showtime.
M	MR. MELCHOIR	Remember to count, ladies. Cross on the left and arms up on eight! On the beat! On the beat! Keep on it! Keep movin' it! C'mon, Miss Forest Lake, take that stick out of your ass or I will. All right. Very nice. Now come on, arms out. We're in the front row. Come on, sell it! That's very nice. Remember, figure eights, ladies...
F	COLLEEN	I can sum up our entire philosophy with this glass. I look at it and say, "it's half full." Which, in the beauty pageant biz means, "Where the hell's my waiter!"
F	COLLEEN	Stop with the fuckin' Marco-Polo before I rip your fat little heads off!
M	MR. MELCHOIR	Miss Burnsville, you're up next...
F	AMBER	Don't tell anyone, but, I have a little secret weapon of my own.
F	AMBER	I don't eat shellfish. Mom always says, "Don't ever eat nothin' that can carry its house around with it -- who knows the last time it's been cleaned." She should know.
M	MISS MINNEAPOLIS	...I've done about thirty-five pageants. I guess my most memorable one'd have to be Miss Teen America, 1995. It was in Vegas. My roommate did Adam West.
M	MISS MINNEAPOLIS	She said he was sooo horny.
F	AMBER	Oh my God. Look at her, she's awesome. I should just go home now.
F	TERRY	Okay, okay, that's enough -- I get it.
M	MISS MINNEAPOLIS	Oh -- oh my God... I gotta go!
F	COLLEEN	Well, you're gonna have to do somethin' with those nerves before Nationals. Thirty-million people aren't gonna wait while you run to the john.
M	FEMALE REPORTER	Today, a beauty pageant turned ugly. A salmonella dysentery outbreak, now traced to improperly refrigerated shellfish, was believed to be the cause. Joining us now is David Richardson, a member of the documentary crew filming the pageant. He was there when tragedy struck.
M	CREW GUY	Fuckin' beauty queens blowin' chunks everywhere. I've never seen anything like it before, and I live in L.A. Hey, Ed.
M	FEMALE REPORTER #2	Can you tell us any thing about the controversy? Is there a controversy here? Has there been sabotage?
F	COLLEEN	People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
F	TERRY	Yeah.
F	COLLEEN	Dakota.
F	TERRY	Ohio...
F	COLLEEN	That bitch from...
F	TERRY	What?
F	COLLEEN	Wisconsin.
F	TERRY	All right, then.
F	COLLEEN	The bitch.
F	TERRY	The important thing is that we have a winner...
M	COLLEEN (ON T.V.)	And, on behalf of the Minnesota Modeling Academy, we proudly present Amber Atkins. Your new Minnesota American Teen Princess.
M	MAYOR	Yah, ain't it just a kick in the fuckin' ass!?!? I'll be a snake's prick if tragedy and pageants ain't got a way of bringin' folks together... Yous boys tell me when want me to start, okay?
F	IONA	Amber?! What-the-hell's goin' on around here? I'm Mount Rose American Teen Princess. Where the hell's my tiara? I bet those sneaky little Japs took it...
M	FEMALE REPORTER (ON T.V.)	Amber, how do you feel?
F	AMBER	I, uh... I feel like... I, uh, I need a shower.
M	CATHY	Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph I hope Gladys Leeman hangs herself in her cell when she hears this.
F	GLADYS	Uh-huh. No, no. Gosh, no. You know I still don't want to be on camera...
M	GLADYS (V.O. ON THE PHONE)	Yah -- I just wanna say -- that little bitch better watch her back at Nationals 'cause I'm makin' friends on the inside... Yah -- friends who have friends on the outside...
M	FEMALE PRISONER	Get your sweet ass off the bunk, Cinnamon.
M	GLADYS (V.O. ON PHONE)	Gotta go.
F	AMBER	I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
F	LORETTA	Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
F	AMBER	I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
F	LORETTA	Annette, just use your hand.
F	ANNETTE	They told me to practice.
F	AMBER	Okay, ready? Here's the signal I'm gonna give Ma when I'm on TV.
F	ANNETTE	My little Carol Burnett.
M	MAYOR	Here she is, Minnesota's American Teen Princess -- soon to be the next America's American Teen Princess -- our little Amber!
F	GLADYS	Come on out, you little blonde piece of trailer park trash!
M	FEMALE REPORTER	We are here in the sixth hour of a shoot-out between Gladys Leeman --
M	MAN AT FOOD SHACK	Get down!
F	AMBER	This is Amber Atkins reporting live from the Food Shack for... KRLH News. One of our reporters has just been shot.
M	BLONDE NEWS ANCHOR	I'm Peter Aitchison.
F	AMBER	And I'm Amber Atkins for WAZB News.
F	AMBER	Good night.
