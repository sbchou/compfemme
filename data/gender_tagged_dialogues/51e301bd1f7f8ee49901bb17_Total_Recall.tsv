M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CLOCK	Tick, tock, seven o'clock. Time to rise and open your eyes.
M	CLOCK	Tick, tock, seven-oh-one. Time to get up, the day had begun.
M	CLOCK	Tick, tock -- attractive and rather off-hand towards him.
M	QUAIL	I dreamed about Mars again... it was bizarre, yet is was so real...
M	KIRSTEN	It's your time of the month again.
M	KIRSTEN	At least once a month. Douglas Quail's obsession. For twelve years you've been talking about Mars.
M	QUAIL	People do go to Mars, you know.
M	KIRSTEN	That's right, Douglas. But not you. Not us.
M	KIRSTEN	As it is, we can barely scrape by on your lousy ten thousand a week.
M	KIRSTEN	What do they expect ... the way men dress these days ... then they scream rape.
M	QUAIL	You know -- let's really do it.
M	KIRSTEN	Rape men in the park?
M	QUAIL	No. Go to Mars.
M	KIRSTEN	Go to hell.
M	QUAIL	We can pool our savings and I've got some sick leave coming, besides my regular vacation...
M	KIRSTEN	...more of a half-wit. For a start a war could break out there any day ...
M	QUAIL	That's just media talk. They're... ...just a minority. They're powerless.
M	KIRSTEN	Well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to Mars. We're broke. I'm just a slave around this dump. Now if you were capable of finding a better job....
M	CLOCK	It's now eight. You'll be late!
M	QUAIL	I'll be late!
M	GUARD	No weapon again, Mr. Quail?
M	QUAIL	I keep forgetting, Herb. They frighten me.
M	GUARD	Yeah? Well, it's the law, Mr. Quail. Has been since 1990 they tell me. Tomorrow - ya carry ya gun or ya get reported.
M	QUAIL	Okay. Herb, okay.
M	NEWSCASTER (V.O.)	-- more violence today from Mars's strike-torn ore colonies --
F	NEWSCASTER	...but Earth Intelligence Operations Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to Mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups.... striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.
M	COHAAGEN	We're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics. Mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of Earth... and will remain so.
M	REPORTER (V.O.)	There have been some criticisms, sir....
M	COHAAGEN	I have no further comment. not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story.
M	ANNOUNCER	Good morning, commuters. This portion of your trip is brought to you by Rekall, Inc. Do you have a dream that never came true? Do you aspire - but only perspire? Has the great adventure passed you by? Then come to... REKALL, where what might have been will have been. For the memories of a lifetime... REKALL.
M	McCLANE	We're all dreamers, Douglas. But here at Rekall, dreams are our business.
M	QUAIL	But... is the process really that effective? A false memory!?
M	McCLANE	We prefer the term "extra- factual implant". Your memory will be complete in every way. You will have gone to Mars. We guarantee that.
M	QUAIL	Is it in any way dangerous? I mean, the medical techniques?
M	McCLANE	Not when you deal with qualified operators - like us.
M	QUAIL	It's just - incredible.
M	McCLANE	program!
M	McCLANE	Space-flight ticket stub... passport... vaccination certificates... matchbooks from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine Restaurants, souvenirs, post cards... even names of people you met - now back there - who you can call and discuss your trip with... by the way, we plant these things where you'll come across them at random in the future.
M	QUAIL	But... I'll know I hired you. That'll destroy the whole illusion.
M	McCLANE	But you won't remember me, or having been here.
M	QUAIL	I won't?
M	McCLANE	Your money back if you do! We've never paid out yet.
M	McCLANE	And we have a special this month, for only two-hundred thousand dollars more.
M	McCLANE	You can have a new identity for the duration of the trip. Pick one.
M	QUAIL	"Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't that be dangerous? I might attack....
M	McCLANE	No. No. You're a retired agent. Mars was your last mission and you're never to break your cover. But you'll have got the girl, killed the baddies, and saved the Universe. Not bad, eh?
M	QUAIL	I don't know... about the whole thing... it's all such a fake. I won't really have gone. I won't really....
M	McCLANE	Let's face it, Douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to Mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for EIO. This - REKALL - is the only way to achieve your dream.
M	McCLANE	Think about it, Douglas. Think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is. Lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather... Rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories.
M	QUAIL	You know that's illegal.
M	KIRSTEN	Yeah? Who's going to report me? You?... wimp....
M	KIRSTEN	Screwing around's illegal, too. But just give me half a chance... instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the
M	OLD LADY	Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull. Sorry I'm late. I'll be right with you.
M	QUAIL	This really going to work?
F	LULL	It the Pope Martian?
M	ERNIE (TECHNICIAN)	Okay -- that's it.
F	LULL	Now, just relax, kid. This ain't gonna hurt. Just a controlled drip of Narkadine. When you're under, I'll just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish-fulfillment program to your needs.
F	LULL	See? Painless. I didn't feel a thing. Hey, you're a nice kid... you like a little somethin' extra?
F	LULL	Good! Kid -- have I got a girl for you! She's gonna like you. You're good-lookin'. Gettin' sleepy? Good. Now, what's the first thing you think of when you're thinkin' about Mars?
M	QUAIL	Well... I'd like to see the Martian Sphinx...
F	LULL	Okay -- you will, Dougle! I want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me.
M	QUAIL	One hundred... ninety-nine... ninety-eight... ninety-seven... ninety-six... ninety-five....
F	LULL	Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars; number sixty-two... and throw in that blonde... We'll give him a real good time.
M	ERNIE	Sixty-two... and... the blonde...
M	ERNIE	Boy, is this one wild. He won't want to come back.
F	LULL	Dougie? This Sophie Lull. Can ya hear me?
M	QUAIL	...Sophie....
F	LULL	Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya a few more questions now. Ya think you'll be able to answer 'em?
M	QUAIL	...Yes....
F	LULL	Attaboy! To begin with, I wanna ask ya; -- You sex life. How many orgasms a week? even Quail) -- as part of his fantasy.
M	McCLANE	Yes? Howie? Listen, you'd better get in here.
M	McCLANE	Not another schizoid embolism.
M	LULL (V.O.)	You'd better get in here. silence.
F	LULL	Quail? Dougie, can you hear me?
M	QUAIL	Yes.
F	LULL	Tell McClane what you told us. cold and steely. In fact, Quail's entire personality seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint-
M	QUAIL	All of you in this room are dead.
M	McCLANE	What's he talking about?
M	QUAIL	You've broken my cover.
M	McCLANE	What is this?...
F	LULL	The Narkadine cracked a memory cap. Mars -- He's really been there.
M	McCLANE	Forced suppression?
M	ERNIE	With spontaneous breakthrough.
M	McCLANE	Holy shit.
M	QUAIL	You've compromised the Sphinx Project. You'll have to be silenced.
M	McCLANE	Wait a minute. Quail --
M	QUAIL	My name isn't Quail.
M	McCLANE	Listen... whoever you are... sir.... ...This is all an accident. We'll destroy all the records. No one will know. I swear it. Believe me.
M	QUAIL	I believe you, but that won't stop E.T.O. from killing you.
M	QUAIL	Killing you... killing you... killing you....
F	LULL	He wants a false memory implanted -- of a trip he really took. Someone at Earth Intelligence Operations erased his memory. All he know was going to Mars meant something special to him.
M	ERNIE	What do we do? Graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing?
F	LULL	Uh-uh... That could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip.
M	McCLANE	Revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here.
F	LULL	Why don't we just wipe out the memory of his visit here?
M	McCLANE	Yes. Good. I'll destroy his file and cancel his fee. I have a feeling that the longer he doesn't know who he is, where he's been, where he's going and who we are, the better off we'll all be. I'm taking a holiday. A real one.
M	QUAIL	Where am I?
M	DRIVER	Travelling south along Third Avenue, passing Fourty-third street.
M	QUAIL	Where am I going?
M	DRIVER	Thirty-three thirteen "G" Street, Sector "L", Twin Towers, Apartment six-thirty- five.
M	QUAIL	How did I get here?
M	DRIVER	I don not understand the question, sir or madam.
M	QUAIL	How did I get into this cab?

M	2ND AGENT	Don't give us a reason to kill you. the door, he call out...
M	QUAIL	Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer... help me... they're...
M	QUAIL	Where are you taking me?
M	1ST AGENT	You told everyone at Rekall about you trip to Mars. Where you went, who you worked for, what you did --
M	QUAIL	But I didn't... Are you telling me... I did go to Mars? I don't remember?
M	1ST AGENT	You've remembered too much. The Sphinx Project, for a start....
M	QUAIL	Sphinx?... No, no, I don't, I... What about the people at Rekall? I don't recall Rekall but you said if they know what I did? Why don't you ask them? They'll tell you I didn't...
M	1ST AGENT	They've been taken care of.
M	QUAIL	What do you mean?
M	QUAIL	What are you going to do with me?
M	1ST AGENT	Get in the car.
M	QUAIL	My God! No! You're going to kill me!
M	1ST AGENT	No one's going to kill you if [you do what you're told.] We're visiting E.I.O. for some new tests. Now get in, or do we start playing rough?
M	QUAIL	No! It's not my fault! You can't do it!
M	QUAIL	Wait a minute, I remember --
M	1ST AGENT	What, Quail? What do you remember?
M	QUAIL	On Mars... they tried to kill me... And....
M	QUAIL	Did you know I've been to Mars?
M	KIRSTEN	What! This stupid obsess...
M	QUAIL	I think I've been. I vaguely recall...
M	KIRSTEN	Doug, you've got to forget...
M	QUAIL	Forget? Remembering is the problem I must've been to one of those artificial memory places...
M	KIRSTEN	Oh my God...
M	QUAIL	But something went wrong... something about a real memory... and then those men... tried to kill me.
M	KIRSTEN	What men? Doug, you're crazy.
M	KIRSTEN	You're here now. They didn't kill you.
M	QUAIL	No. That's what's so amazing. I killed them. I think...
M	KIRSTEN	Where? Where are they?
M	KIRSTEN	Doug! It's something they put into your mind at the memory place. Fantasies. That's their business.
M	KIRSTEN	You're a computer operator. You're a bore. You're a wimp. You're not a killer.
M	QUAIL	I'm involved somehow with E.I.O. It's true. It's no fantasy.
M	KIRSTEN	Doug, I want you to see a doctor. Now Alec and Shirley Turnbull have a good man. He helped Alec through his breakdown.
M	QUAIL	For fuck's sake, this is no breakdown! compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to
M	QUAIL	My God! Did you say I need a psychiatrist?
M	KIRSTEN	I haven't seen you move that fast since I've known you.
M	QUAIL	How could you do it? After eight years!
M	KIRSTEN	I'm not your wife, Quail.
M	QUAIL	Not my wife! You are out of your mind.
M	KIRSTEN	It's a false memory implant. I never saw you before six weeks ago.
M	QUAIL	Why are you lying like this?
M	KIRSTEN	No, Quail. It's true. You work for E.I.O. So do I.
M	QUAIL	But why all of this?
M	KIRSTEN	We had to watchdog you...make sure the erasure took. A wife seemed like a good idea.
M	QUAIL	But I remember it! All of it!... Us!
M	KIRSTEN	All implanted.
M	QUAIL	Our friends... my work... eight years.
M	KIRSTEN	The job's real -- you've had is six weeks -- since you got back from Mars.
M	KIRSTEN	It's all a fabrication, Quail. Everything you know.
M	QUAIL	This is crazy! If all my memories are false, who am I? What am I? Jesus... it's like I don't exist.
M	KIRSTEN	You exist, all right. That's the problem.
M	QUAIL	Why did you try to kill me? Why does E.I.O. want me dead?
M	KIRSTEN	They don't particularly. That was my idea. This assignment was boring me to death. The personality they gave you wasn't too thrilling.
M	QUAIL	Well, what did I do on Mars that they have to keep me from telling?
M	KIRSTEN	I've no idea. I just work here.
M	QUAIL	All right... I'm leaving. Don't try and follow me --
M	KIRSTEN	I don't have to follow you. You can't get away from E.I.O. Nobody does.
M	QUAIL	No wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife -- type casting. halt abruptly.
M	FIRST GUNMAN	Fuck it!
M	SECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER)	We won't be able to track him again until he comes up above ground! confused, distraught. A commercial comes onto the video.

M	EARPLUG WEARER	Coming in again. Loud and clear.
M	ROBOT DRIVER	You are being fired on, sir or madam, please leave the cab at once.
M	ROBOT DRIVER	[Please....]
M	ROBOT DRIVER	...leave the cab as bullets are hitting the vehicle in considerable quantities.
M	ROBOT DRIVER	This company, sir or madam, will institute legal action for damages...
M	DESK CLERK	Help you, sir?
M	QUAIL	A room for the night.
M	DESK CLERK	ID.
M	QUAIL	Here's ten thousand. Forget the ID.
M	QUAIL	I have a liaison with a lady... and I'm married...
M	DESK CLERK	I understand, sir. Nothing like a bit on the side, eh? Bit of fugitive flesh. The greatest aphrodisiac is a new body, wouldn't you say, sir?
M	QUAIL	I told you, I don't want to be disturbed.
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	If you want to live, don't hand up.
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	They've got you bugged... They're gonna find you. Faster than you can say "Back Rodgers". And don't bother shaking down your clothes -- the monitor is embedded in your skull.
M	QUAIL	Who are you? What the hell is this? youngish and conservatively dressed. He speaks rapidly and urgently.
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	Take a wet towel and wrap it around your head. That will deaden the signal. It'll take longer for them to pinpoint you.
M	QUAIL	Why should I trust you?
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	There's a real old saying - "Beggars can't be choosers". Go and soak your head!
M	EARPHONE WEARER	Shit!
M	DRIVER	Cut the language, will ya?
M	EARPHONE WEARER	It's gone! Some...malfunction...
M	DRIVER	Toldya the Martian assembled [stuff don't work.] up the phone.
M	QUAIL	Keep talking.
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	Head over to Skid Row -- to the Lucky Stub Pawnshop -- corner of Park Avenue and Fifty-eighth. Tell the man you're Mr. Hotchkiss; you came for your Grecian candlesticks.
M	QUAIL	What do I want with Grecian candlesticks!
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	Just do it! This is no time for small talk. How did you know where to find me?
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	I've been tailing you since you get back from Mars.
M	QUAIL	You're E.I.O. You're on the other team.
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	I'm E.I.O. But I was your best friend. Scott Stevens - we arranged this...
M	QUAIL	I can't remember - only bits...
M	TELEPHONE VOICE	I was your fail-safe -- if and when the shooting started. Good luck. Look me up if you remember me.
M	1ST MAN (RED-HEADED)	Well, look at that. He's really got his hands full.
M	2ND MAN	Not so full, so I've heard.
M	EARPHONE WEARER	Quick. The guy who checked in fifteen minutes ago.
M	CLERK	Room...thirty-six.
M	CLERK	He was only meeting a lady... Aren't you guys overdoing it a bit? a slum.
M	PAWNBROKER	You wanta camera? I got some good, top-quality ones. You want silk rugs? Handmade last century in Iran...all perfect. You want videos? Old movies... classics...all those Vietnam war ones...real quaint stuff... you want...
M	QUAIL	I'm Hotchkiss...I came for the...Grecian candlesticks...
M	QUAIL	I wonder if you could tell me...
M	PAWNBROKER	I trust these will look well in you... mosque. tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of it red.
M	QUAIL	Martian money.... some sort; and a strange thing that looks like a silver down to the clothes Quail is wearing now.

M	CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)	"Hauser, this is Hauser -- or whatever you think your name is now. If you're listening to this, I'm talking to myself. Your memory's been erased and you've got a wet towel around your head. "The first thing you've got to do is get rid of that bug in your head."
M	CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)	The monitoring device is located in your left maxillary sinus cavity. Make a small incision in your neck just below the left ear, and insert the wire up into the sinus. The head is self-guiding. Just shove.
M	CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)	You won't feel a thing. The spray cartridge contains a local anesthetic and a blood coagulant. Careful, it's my neck, too.
M	EARPLUG WEARER	It's come on again.
M	DRIVER	Where?
M	EARPLUG WEARER	He's in that old flophouse. Plaza Hotel. Central Park South.
M	EARPLUG WEARER	Boy, he's really moving around. They all stare in disbelief.
M	EARPLUG WEARER	Ya dirty rat! some KIND OF MILITARY TRAINING.
M	COHAAGEN	Anything?
M	SUPERVISOR	We're running every one of his memory tapes for the past fifteen years. Nothing yet, sir.
M	COHAAGEN	There must be something -- some place he would go, some friend he would run to.
M	RED-HEADED MAN	They lost him.
M	COHAAGEN	Again?!
M	COHAAGEN	Are you sure the original suppression took?
M	SUPERVISOR	Absolutely, sir. He thinks he's Quail, a computer...
M	COHAAGEN	Then how do you explain what he's doing?
M	SUPERVISOR	Just his instincts. He was well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe the memory cap's fractured. Portions of his prior identity could be leaking through.
M	COHAAGEN	He'll remember Mars? The Sphinx Project?
M	SUPERVISOR	Fragments. Nothing more. Nothing he could piece together. I did advise terminating him, rather than implanting an identify alternative.
M	COHAAGEN	What do you think I am? A barbarian? We're not living in the twentieth century!
M	COHAAGEN	Hold it there. they shine in the face of each passenger going through.
M	PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1	If he had to travel to Mars with that bunch, I'd be sorry for him.

M	PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1	No way. Let's get a coffee before the next shuttle. announcement comes over the intercom.
M	CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)	Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll glance out the starboard viewports, you'll behold an indeed awesome sight --
M	CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)	Those long gorges you see, clearly are the legendary canals of Mars....
M	CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)	Of course, they are not manmade canals, but vast natural chasms ...many deeper and larger than the Grand Canyon. Though utterly without moisture now, scientists have determined that they were formed by massive flooding millions of years ago. Surface temperatures at the Martian equator is minus one-hundred and twenty degrees Centigrade -- in winter. Fortunately, this time of year it's slightly more seasonable: Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit, outside the domes. Please remember, folks, that outside the domes you'll need to carry your own personal oxygen supply at all times. The atmosphere of Mars is almost a vacuum.

M	TOUR ORGANISER	No. Quite a bit to see, though. The canyons, the old Sphinx...
M	QUAIL	What do you know about that?
M	TOUR ORANISER	Not much, really. Millions of years old. Bit like the one that used to be in Egypt, you know...
M	QUAIL	Yeah. Got destroyed in the Arab wars... What about this independence movement?
M	TOUR ORGANISER	Not worth worrying about. Mostly descendants of the original colonists from Earth. Now they want self-rule so they can sell us all the minerals... I don't think we've met. You with our group? Takes me a while to know everyone.

M	QUAIL	Prejudiced? Against what?
M	DOORMAN	Earthmen.

M	DOORMAN	The Martian National Anthem. dirty, Casbah-like streets. AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in spotless linen fill the lobby.
M	CANNED VOICE	"...the Martian Sphinx... only evidence of non-human civilization ever discovered ...age estimated at over eighteen million years...
M	CLERK	Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Hauser.
M	QUAIL	Nice to be back. I'm flattered you remember me.
M	CLERK	Part of my job, sir.
M	QUAIL	Do you remember my first name, too?
M	CLERK	Charles. Charles Hauser, right?
M	QUAIL	I'm impressed. Listen. I need transportation to the... uh... the Sphinx. Can you arrange it for me?
M	CLERK	I'm sorry, sir. But Earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely. No one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles.
M	CLERK	Oh... Do you want the item you left with us?
M	QUAIL	What item? Oh... yes, please. in longhand:
M	"MELINA NOEL	Last Chance Air Station Kilometer 61 Gird Square T9"
M	CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)	Need a cab, boss mon?
M	BENNIE	Mine's right around the corner.
M	QUAIL	That one's closer.
M	BENNIE	But I out-hustle him, right?
M	QUAIL	Right. "LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS". and cowboys -- but with a space-age look. ...if that intergalactic little Napoleon thinks I'm sellin' and clearin' outta here, he can think again!
M	MINER #2	...watcha gonna do when he cuts off the air, Luke?
M	MINER #3	...you'll be breathin' red dust and shittin' bricks. ...my wife ain't goin' on one of those space shuttles... she hates flyin'...
M	MINER #5	...aw, come on... flyin's safer'n crossin' the road...
M	MINER #6	...yeah, there ain't been a real disaster since that collision off Phobos, nigh on twenty years ago...
M	MINER #4	...well, that killed twelve thousand...
M	QUAIL	What is this, Bennie... Tombstone?
M	BENNIE	Sorta. Bunch of miners out here got their own claims, from way back. Cohaagen's buyin' em all up, says he's gonna cut off the air an' water if they won't sell...
M	QUAIL	I'm looking for Melina Noel.
M	BARTENDER	You've found her.
F	MELINA	You bastard! swinging doors. of how well he might have known this woman.
F	MELINA	You bastard...
F	MELINA	That's new -- the innocent look. You didn't have that one before. Well?
M	QUAIL	Well, uh... I...
F	MELINA	All right, I'll say it for you.
F	MELINA	Don't worry. I got the note. You discharged your obligation.
M	QUAIL	What note?
F	MELINA	Oh, the usual one. "Must return immediately to Earth... the wife needs me..."
M	QUAIL	I don't have a wife. Well, I do - but not a real wife. Hell... look... someone else sent that note. Someone who --
F	MELINA	What are you here for?!
M	QUAIL	For you! I don't even know why --
M	QUAIL	Whoever I was, I must have been a helluva guy.
F	MELINA	"Whoever you were"???
M	QUAIL	Listen. I've for to tell you something. I beg you to believe me... help me --
M	QUAIL	Something happened to my mind. Memory suppression, false implant, I don't know what --
M	QUAIL	What I'm saying is... I don't remember you. I don't remember us. I don't remember me --
F	MELINA	[And I thought...]
M	QUAIL	Who is us?
F	MELINA	Memory erasure is what they use on agents. Go away.
M	QUAIL	Wait... I was an agent -- I'm not now -- just tell me who I am! How did we know each other? Why are they trying to kill me?!
F	MELINA	I'm not trusting you again.
M	QUAIL	You loved me once, you must have --
F	MELINA	That you was a liar. Who you are now I don't even know.
M	QUAIL	Please, Melina --
F	MELINA	Get out! I need your help --
F	MELINA	Get out! Get the hell away from me!
M	BENNIE	You don't look so good, boss. All over the Universe, women is an awful curse.
M	BENNIE	It's a tough planet, boss.
M	QUAIL	Yeah, right.
M	BENNIE	Some guy really screwed her - screwed her up real good. Some Earthman. Just hopped on a space shuttle.
M	QUAIL	Listen, Bennie. You're pretty well informed?
M	BENNIE	If that means I know it all, you're right, boss.
M	QUAIL	What do you know about the Sphinx?
M	BENNIE	I don't know nothin'. Not about the Sphinx. That's out of the ball park.
M	QUAIL	I have to get there. Can't you help me?
M	BENNIE	No can do, mon. You want women, cigarettes, red-market money, booze, even air or water... Bennie's your man. But the Sphinx... that's E.I.O. --
M	BENNIE	Well... look at that one, eh?
M	QUAIL	What?
M	BENNIE	Big cheese in town. Big smelly cheese.
M	QUAIL	Cohaagen? But isn't he often here?
M	BENNIE	No way. That cat just cheat the Martian workers without ever leavin' his place in Beverly Hills. Somethin' must be cookin'. studies himself in the mirror. He looks haggard. He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at the door.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Mr. Hauser...
M	QUAIL	Who is it?
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to you... about Douglas Quail.
M	QUAIL	Who are you?
M	VOICE (O.S.)	My name is George Edgemar. I work for Rekall, Incorporated.
M	QUAIL	Rekall?? Yes. It's difficult to explain... Could you open the door, please? I'm not armed.

M	QUAIL	All right... come in.
M	EDGEMAR	My card, Mr. Quail.
M	QUAIL	Okay -- so you're Doctor George Edgemar of 'Rekall, Inc.' So?
M	EDGEMAR	As I said... this is going to be very difficult -- for both of us.
M	QUAIL	I'm listening.
M	EDGEMAR	Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're not really standing here at this moment.
M	QUAIL	Sat that again.
M	EDGEMAR	I said, you're not really here. Neither am I. We're both in the Memory Studio -- in the offices of Rekall, Inc. On Earth.
M	QUAIL	Are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some... artificially injected fantasy? That I never really left Earth?
M	EDGEMAR	No, not quite. We didn't give you this. You're creating it yourself -- Remember the option we offered you? Intelligence agent? Something inside you liked that idea, fastened on it. What you're experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating.
M	QUAIL	What is this shit you're giving me?
M	EDGEMAR	This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail. It's the truth. I know it's very hard for you to accept, but you're having a schizophrenic reaction... we can't snap you out of the Narkadine. You're in a world of your own fantasy.
M	QUAIL	Then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it's just a dream?
M	EDGEMAR	I've been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy. I'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console. This is a last resort. When somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy, we send in someone after them. A specialist, like myself.
M	QUAIL	I don't believe a word you're saying.
M	EDGEMAR	I was afraid you'd think that. I'm sorry to have to do this, but you really are stuck. Doctor Noel, would you come in now please?
F	MELINA	Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid it's all true.
F	MELINA	I tried to break through to you earlier, but you just molded me into your fantasy. Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you.
M	QUAIL	So what's supposed to happen now?
M	EDGEMAR	Just do exactly as we tell you.
M	QUAIL	Somehow that doesn't appeal to me.
F	MELINA	Please, Mr. Quail... try to cooperate. You're having a schizophrenic embolism.
M	EDGEMAR	If we can't get you out now... you may never come out of it. Your wife calls every day --
M	QUAIL	If this is a fantasy, there'll be no real consequences when I pull this trigger.
M	EDGEMAR	But there will by consequences inside your mind. Consequences that won't hurt me... but could be fatal to you. If you shoot me, you'll wipe me out of your fantasy -- I can't come back again. Because to you, I'll be dead. I can't help you get back to reality. You'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.
M	EDGEMAR	You're going to lower the gun, Mr. Quail. You're going to hand it to me --
M	EDGEMAR	You're going to do exactly what I tell you --
F	MELINA	Watch out, Charles! There's more of them in the hall!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	You've had it, Hauser! Throw out your weapon if you want a past!
F	MELINA	There's an explosive in the clipboard! He has a dead-man switch in his hand!
M	VOICE (O.S.)	What do you say, Hauser? We haven't got all night! Hauser?
M	QUAIL	What happens it I come out?
M	VOICE (O.S.)	We'll put in a word with the big boys. Maybe you'll just get exile to Venus.
M	QUAIL	All right. Here comes the weapon.
M	QUAIL	Back in, quick!
M	WAITER	Wouldn't you prefer your order in your room, sir?
M	QUAIL	In!
M	QUAIL	Okay. Answers! Now!
F	MELINA	They kidnapped me. Said they'd kill you if I didn't cooperate. I told them I didn't care, but then when I realized they meant it...
M	QUAIL	I don't know why they're after me, but what's your connection with all this?
F	MELINA	We were together before.
M	QUAIL	Believe me, I'm really sorry I can't recall the details of that encounter.
F	MELINA	Go, Bennie, for God's sake!
M	BENNIE	Bad news, boss lady.
F	MELINA	What?
M	BENNIE	Black cruiser just pull out behind us.
M	BENNIE	Forget the shooter, boss. I lose 'em for you.
M	QUAIL	Lose them? In this?
M	BENNIE	Hang on!
M	QUAIL	You're gonna get a ticket for that engine, Bennie --
M	BENNIE	Yutani 650 -- you like it, boss? Nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of speed.
F	MELINA	You better have two aces, Bennie. There's a second cruiser -- and it's gaining -- huge water selling stand. The official car brakes to make
M	COHAAGEN	I take it, then, you've failed to get him again.
M	COHAAGEN	Proceed with Operation Sphinx.
M	EMILE	But, sir...
M	COHAAGEN	With him... ...on the lose, I'm not taking any more chances. Operation Sphinx will flush him out. amazement.
M	QUAIL	What's all this?
M	BENNIE	Nothin', boss. Just old smokies. Only place they can come for a puff. It's all banned topside.
M	QUAIL	So you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business.
M	BENNIE	That's right, boss. on it.
M	QUAIL	My God!... T-shirts. They died out on Earth years ago.
M	BENNIE	Well, maybe we ain't fashion leaders, boss.
F	MELINA	No. But we still believe in a free Mars. FRONT" posters. A group of people are printing T-shirts Bennie.
M	QUAIL	So where did I fit into all this?
F	MELINA	You - when you were Charles Hauser with E.I.O - infiltrated our group. I guess Cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and I...
M	QUAIL	Yeah. And I can't even remember it. We'll have to arrange a return bout.
F	MELINA	...so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity.
M	QUAIL	But - the Sphinx. Why is that stuck in my mind? Why's it so important?
F	MELINA	I don't know.
M	BENNIE	Just an ole heap o' stone, boss.
M	QUAIL	It's more than that, Bennie, I know it's more. Somehow it's connected.
F	MELINA	Maybe there's a way you can get your memory back.
M	QUAIL	How? What? Where? When?
F	MELINA	A bit of Martian Wisdom. We're not all stupid colonists. the crowd. It is also swinging a powerful searchlight along the footpaths and streets.
M	VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER	...all residents are to report to their nearest space-travel agent within twelve hours, all residents will be departing on shuttles within twenty-four hours. Air and water supplies will be cut off at that time. I repeat...
F	MELINA	He's doing it!
M	QUAIL	What? Why?
F	MELINA	Clearing everyone out! It's been rumored for months...
M	QUAIL	Wow. I can see why I was willing to betray E.I.O.
F	MELINA	I though you believed in our cause? Yes. Of course. That, too. like something out of "The Arabian Nights".
M	STRANGE MAN	Your servant, Fahreem Kuato. I greet you by the twenty-seven names that still remain, praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life.
M	QUAIL	What use is this weirdo?
F	MELINA	Ssssh...there are skills on mars that Earth has forgotten.
M	KUATO	No need to introduce yourself, Mr. Quail. Tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought-after man on two worlds.
M	KUATO	This way, my dear man. We have much to accomplish -- -- and very little time. to time. They are repeating the evacuation message from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the apprehension of Quail and Melina...
M	VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER	...for information leading to these arrests, first-class travel to Earth will be provided plus a weekend at the Leningrad Disneyworld, all expenses paid. I repeat, an Oriental girl and Earthman, possibly to be found in the company of a black taxi driver. These are dangerous subversives and sworn enemies of the glorious Peoples Republic of
M	KUATO	The turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you. You have brought it to Mars in your search for yourself.
M	QUAIL	And you're going to help me by reading my mind?
M	KUATO	Indubitably. There is only small matter of a fee.
M	QUAIL	A fee!
M	KAUTO	Naturally.
F	MELINA	This is for our cause!
M	KUATO	Income before ideals. Shall we say five-hundred-thousand dollars?
M	QUAIL	Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars, that's...
M	KUATO	Not Martian dollars, Mr. Quail - Earth dollars.
F	MELINA	That's interplanetary robbery!
M	QUAIL	With today's exchange rate... that's over two million Martian dollars!
M	KUATO	What price do you put, Mr. Quail, on the future of the solar system?
M	BENNIE	Aw, come off it, man. Just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball.
M	KUATO	Listen, buster, we're talking heavy stuff here. You try and work out what's with this guy!
M	QUAIL	Okay! Okay! I'll pay it, but the Interstellar Trade Practices Commission might be interested in this. a seance.
M	KUATO	Retrieving the past is like walking backwards along a perilous road. The half-recalled, the half-forgotten, the repressed, the fantasies, the triumphs, joys, failures, betrayals...
M	KUATO	Yes... I can feel it... a wall. Erasure techniques are so brutal. Blocks. Side channels. Future and past all jumbled. I shall have to enter deep trance to break through. I will be scanning you through the Oracle Head.
M	ORACLE HEAD	Do not fear me. I need your openness...
M	ORACLE HEAD	Open you thoughts to my presence...
M	ORACLE HEAD	Open... excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing hand reaches out. amazing skill and resourcefulness. With his bound hands
M	ORACLE HEAD'S VOICE	You have seen your past. Now read the future...
F	MELINA	Charles! Are you all right?
F	MELINA	He kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance! We couldn't wake either of you!
M	BENNIE	You stopped breathing!
M	QUAIL	Why did you kill him? It was the next bit I really...
M	BENNIE	No choice, boss. It was him or you. over. The Head is still alive!
M	ORACLE HEAD	-- the vengence you seek... and the salvation of Mars... are waiting for you in the crown of the Sphinx. mouth.
M	BENNIE	Phobos and Demos! What was that all about?
F	MELINA	Are you okay?... Charles? Doug? Whoever? agent. Melina senses immediately that this is the man she knew before
M	QUAIL	I'm fine... only I'm not Doug -- I'm Charles Hauser... and I know everything Hauser knew.
M	QUAIL	Bennie, where's your depot?
M	BENNIE	Well... you go outta here... take a left, then down past the first... no second... water bureau you...
M	QUAIL	Can you get us there?
M	BENNIE	No problem.
F	MELINA	But why?
M	QUAIL	We're going to the Sphinx.
M	BENNIE	Impossible, man. Guards everywhere.
F	MELINA	The Oracle... what did you learn?
M	QUAIL	Only everything. I've got total recall.
M	BENNIE	We'll never get near the Sphinx! They'll blow us apart! pass. Camera tracks rapidly with them.
F	MELINA	What are we doing, Charles? For God's sake, tell us.
M	QUAIL	The Sphinx... it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago. The same race that built the on one Earth... for the same purpose.
M	QUAIL	This is what we need.
M	BENNIE	It's a hunk of old stone, man.
F	MELINA	Purpose? What purpose?
M	QUAIL	Come on, Bennie, move it. Have you heard the word, "terriform"? of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports. looking for Quail and Melina.
M	BENNIE	Just deliverin' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia. Got them people you're lookin' for in the back as well. up on the rear seats.
M	QUAIL	The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet. There are tunnels and ducts everywhere, all powered by fusion generators...
M	BENNIE	You sure the little man didn't fry your brain, Quail?
F	MELINA	For what? To do what?
M	QUAIL	To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.
M	BENNIE	That's air!
M	QUAIL	That's right. Air and water. Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars. No more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert. There'll be rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth.
F	MELINA	So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out?
M	QUAIL	Don't you see?! From being a pile of red dirt with minerals, Mars is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate.
F	MELINA	And Cohaagen's going to own it all!
M	QUAIL	Right! He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth. Beach condos, ski resorts, you name it.
F	MELINA	No wonder he wanted you to... penetrate... out group.
M	QUAIL	Once word of this gets out, the whole planet will support you.
F	MELINA	So what can we do?
M	QUAIL	Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here.
F	MELINA	But who'll work the machine? Do you know how?
M	QUAIL	I'm the only one who does. Why do you think Cohaagen's left me alone all this time?
M	QUAIL	I was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the Sphinx. It must've been programmed. Some kind of...force...shot into me.
F	MELINA	But Cohaagen wiped your memory!!!
M	QUAIL	Just a way of putting me on ice. He'd of reversed it once the planet was evacuated.
M	BENNIE	Man! This is real complicated. Go over it again, real slow.
M	QUAIL	What he hadn't counted on was your effect on me.
F	MELINA	And all without the marvels of modern science!
M	QUAIL	Bennie, don't stop now, take it...
F	MELINA	You bastard.
M	BENNIE	Like I said. It's a tough planet. I'm a baddie, not a goodie.
M	QUAIL	I should have known, you were just too helpful.
M	BENNIE	EIO Rule One, man. Trust Nobody. Now you can do your terriforming stuff shuttles are gone.
F	MELINA	But what about the Martian people? Out cause? I thought you believed in it.
M	BENNIE	Your cause? That bunch of dead beat radicals! When I hand in this little number... ...I'll get real estate rights on the whole of Chryse Planitia... hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has
M	BENNIE	This makes Bennie a cut above anyone else. Quail's jaw with his real hand. Quail sprawls, dazed. appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay. VACUUM! Sphinx looms ominously.
M	QUAIL	Hope I've got this direction right.
M	COHAAGEN	The air supply is off under the domes?
M	EMILE	Yes, sir. In a couple of hours it'll be all gone.
M	COHAAGEN	Any trouble with the rabble?
M	EMILE	Not much, sir. A lot of complaining. But they're all heading towards the shuttle areas.
F	MELINA	We got in with this thing, but we'll never get back out.
M	QUAIL	A shame. Such a pleasant trip. the wall. super-sophisticated technology. see the first interior level of the Sphinx itself.
M	QUAIL	This is the main tap -- straight down to the core of Mars. When we trigger the mechanism, fusion reactors will detonate down there -- four hundred miles deep.
F	MELINA	Remind me not to slip.
M	QUAIL	The new elements will come booming up through this shaft -- and six thousand others all around the planet.
M	GUARD LEADER	Stay in contact. I want to hear from this checkpoint every four minutes.
M	GUARD #1	Did you hear something?
M	GUARD #2	No. Where?
M	GUARD #1	Over there. cock their weapons, start cautiously forward. Just as they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the ready: I'm not there, boys. I'm here.
M	GUARD #1	Watch him. He was EIO trained. They're all full of tricks.
M	GUARD #2	Yeah? Like...who was that guy? -- Fred Bond?? Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em up.
M	GUARD #1	A hologram!
F	MELINA	Where'd you get that little trick?
M	QUAIL	Mail-order company. It's a great one for fooling the wife. Level One.
M	COHAAGEN	How the hell did they get in?
M	SECURITY AIDE	Up the fusion core.
M	COHAAGEN	Up the fusion core??
M	SECURITY AIDE	They're on Level One.
M	COHAAGEN	Seal all upper levels.
M	QUAIL	Know how to use one of these?
M	QUAIL	Catch! He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator. Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object. It is an explosive device of some sort. Quail and Melina
F	MELINA	Great stuff, but how do we get up?
M	COHAAGEN	Forget them. We'll pick up Quail once the shuttles have left for Earth.
M	QUAIL	If you're afraid of the heights, you better get over it real quick.
M	EMILE	If Quail's the only one who can operate all this... ...then he can call all the shots.
M	COHAAGEN	We'll tell him the computer's worked out the operational details so we don't really need him. We're just doing him a favor.
M	EMILE	And if that doesn't work?
M	COHAAGEN	We offer him rewards.
M	EMILE	What if that doesn't work?
M	COHAAGEN	We'll torture him. You don't think I got this far by being a nice guy?
M	OPERATOR	First of the shuttles ready for departure, sir. Two minute countdown. storm of shards and shrapnell.
M	COHAAGEN	Seal the breach! Repressurize!
F	MELINA	Those shuttles are starting up any minute. If you know how to work this thing, you better do it now.
M	QUAIL	Yes...
F	MELINA	Don't you know how?
M	QUAIL	Yes... there's a vital connection missing...
M	QUAIL	...me...
M	COHAAGEN	Wait!
F	MELINA	Don't wait!
M	COHAAGEN	If you activate the mechanism you'll die...there were glimpses of it in your memory.
M	QUAIL	Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a long tunnel, a brilliant white light, hands reaching for me...
M	COHAAGEN	That's your death. That's what it looks like. That's what is always looks like.
F	MELINA	Charles - for Mars's sake....
M	COHAAGEN	It's not too late. Join us again. U've a lot to offer. A whole world.
M	QUAIL	You don't deserve a new world, you and people like you made too big a mess of the old one. Time someone else had a chance. the two hands touch. only intermittently as debris crashes around them. quartz. perspective --
M	QUAIL	Am I dying?
M	MASKED MINER	I won't lie to you, pal. You are. I'd say in about forty years... ...come on, we've gotta get to the Space Port. That Intergalactic Napoleon's switched off the air.
M	2ND MINER	Shippin' us all out. Mars is finished.
F	MELINA	It's happening.
M	MINER	What is it? realizes he can breathe without it. Quail takes off his own, then Melina's
M	QUAIL	That's just the start. Next there'll be rain and growth and ... life.
M	QUAIL	Rekall could never have come up with anything like this.
