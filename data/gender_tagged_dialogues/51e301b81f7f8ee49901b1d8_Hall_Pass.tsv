M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	RICK	Pull over, man!
M	FRED	No way, I can out-run 'em!
M	RICK	No you can't--not in this thing! Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Oh God, now there's two of 'em!
M	FRED	I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there!
M	RICK	Are you crazy?!
M	FRED	Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife! Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS
M	RICK	Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain every--! AS A BURLY OFFICER'S HEAD CONNECTS WITH RICK'S CHEST, we... .And FADE TO BLACK... and then: Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:
M	RICK (O.S.)	See the stud in the blue shorts? That's me the summer I got out of college.
M	LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)	Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles. REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on
M	RICK	I still have a few.
M	GUNNAR	Where? Rick shoots him a look.
M	RICK	They're hidden. BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes
F	EMMA	Who's that girl?
M	RICK	That's Mommy.
F	EMMA	No, I mean the young one standing next to you.
M	RICK	That's Mommy.
F	EMMA	Mommy used to have long hair? And she wore a bikini? Yes she did.
F	EMMA	How come she doesn't wear a bikini anymore?
M	GUNNAR	Is it because of her fat ass?
M	RICK	I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's got a fat ass?
M	GUNNAR	Mommy.
M	RICK	Well, uh, I don't appreciate that language, Gunnar. You've got the best mom in the whole world--don't ever say anything bad about her. Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE-
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Hey beautiful, you better get a move on--we're supposed to be meeting Fred and Grace soon.
F	MAGGIE	I know, I know, I'm trying.
M	RICK	Well how long you gonna be?
F	MAGGIE	Forty-five minutes--sooner if you help with the kids. Maggie looks to him, hopeful. Forty-five minutes is good. Maggie shoots him a look and Rick smiles.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	I'm kidding. Okay, kids, first one in the tub gets college paid for. Emma and Gunnar just stare at him.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Come on, you bums, let's go! As Rick starts to tickle his kids they run out of the room,
M	RICK	I miss going out with you on Saturday nights. She smiles at him.
F	MAGGIE	I know, it's just like the old days. Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.
M	RICK	Maybe we should make a rule that we go out at least six nights a week without the kids. Maggie GIGGLES.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	I'm serious. We should go out every week--just you and me. A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK
M	RICK (CONT'D)	I think it'd be healthy.
F	MAGGIE	You gotta be kidding me? Maggie pulls away.
M	RICK	What?
F	MAGGIE	You just checked out that girl's butt.
M	RICK	I did?
F	MAGGIE	Yeah, you did, and it's rude.
M	RICK	Why? You think she saw me?
F	MAGGIE	saw you.
M	RICK	Oh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm just kind of spacey today.
M	GRACE (O.S.)	Come on, we're late! REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,
F	MAGGIE	Grace, let me ask you something: Does Fred ever check out other women in front of you?
F	GRACE	No, Fred's not a gawker. Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.
M	GRACE (CONT'D)	Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to Dr. Lucy. We follow the women as they leave their husbands and ENTER
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	There they are! ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DR. LUCY GILBERT, a very attractive and
F	GRACE	Dr. Lucy! Congratulations!
F	DR. LUCY	Girls, thank you so much for coming. Dr. Lucy speaks with a FRENCH ACCENT.
F	MAGGIE	Are you kidding me? You're the only friend of ours who ever got an award--you think we're going to miss that? ANGLE ON Rick and Fred standing at the bar.
M	FRED	Do you mind telling me how your wife catches you checking out another girl? What is this, amateur hour? The BARTENDER delivers a couple beers and Rick pays.
M	RICK	The girl walked past and I glanced back at her for like half a second.
M	FRED	There's your problem, dumb-ass-- it's the wrong order. You don't wait for the girl to walk past and then glance back. You turn when she's still fifteen feet in front of you...then you wait for her to walk into your line of vision. Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the Observe. Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and
M	FRED (CONT'D)	You see? I can't help it if her butt walks where I'm already looking. It was your air space.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Hey, guys. They turn to see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN with a healthy tan walking
M	RICK AND FRED	Hey, Missy.
F	MISSY	Don't forget to mingle! The guys watch Missy walk away.
M	FRED	Wow. Missy's looking pretty good for someone going through a divorce.
M	RICK	Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard they might have to sell the house.
M	FRED	Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for the listing?
M	RICK	What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't go after the divorcee business unless they approach me first.
M	FRED	Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh? As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping
F	GRACE	Look at those two meatheads checking out Missy Frankenfield. What, do they think they're invisible over there?
F	MAGGIE	I thought you said Fred wasn't a gawker.
F	GRACE	He was standing right next to you. I can't let him know that I know-- that would take all the fun out of it. You should see him. He's got some stupid move where he looks back before the girl passes to make it seem like he couldn't help but notice her ass. It's pathetic. Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE.
M	RICK	How about I drive the babysitter home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar? He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front
F	MAGGIE	I want to, honey, but I've got to get up early with the kids.
M	RICK	I'll get up with the kids.
F	MAGGIE	But I have to go out and buy a gift- -they're going to a birthday party tomorrow.
M	RICK	I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take the kids to the park, then to the party. You can dust stay in bed,, get your beauty sleep, and bask in the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about to give you.
F	MAGGIE	I love it when you sweet-talk me. Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing
M	GUNNAR	Mommy! Daddy! Little buddy.. .what are you doing up? Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs
M	RICK (CONT'D)	This is just a minor obstacle.
M	RICK	How were the kids tonight?
F	PAIGE	Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute-- all he wants to do is wrestle with me. Rick smiles at this.
M	PAIGE (CONT'D)	Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn down the air--I'm a little chilly. Look--I got goose bumps. As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we
M	RICK	Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry. Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE
F	PAIGE	Thank you.
M	RICK	'Welcome.
F	PAIGE	Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?
M	RICK	Sure.
F	PAIGE	I was wondering... .could you buy me some beer? Rick looks surprised.
M	RICK	Buy you some.. .How old are you?
F	PAIGE	Twenty. But I'm turning twenty-one next week.
M	RICK	Oh. Happy birthday. That's a biggie.
F	PAIGE	Yeah. My aunt usually buys beer for me, but she's out of town. So. . .could ya?
M	RICK	Uh, I don't know, Paige...I could get in a lot of trouble for giving alcohol to a minor.
F	PAIGE	Oh, come on, I'm a junior in college. You drank when you were in college, didn't you?
M	RICK	Well, uh...
F	PAIGE	Besides, it's so arbitrary. How does it make sense that twenty's old enough to fight in Iraq or watch a porno movie, but it's too young to drink a beer? Rick shifts in his seat.
M	RICK	Really? Twenty's old enough to uh...?
F	PAIGE	Fight in Iraq?
M	RICK	No, the other thing.
F	PAIGE	Watch Porn? Oh, God yeah--half the girls in those things are my age. Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg.
M	PAIGE (CONT'D)	Look, I promise no one's gonna find out. If you want, you can join me down at the lake--we'll listen to some tunes and have a couple beers. Rick stares at her, pictures it in his head. She looks
M	RICK	I'm sorry, Paige, I can't do that.
F	PAIGE	Why not?
M	RICK	Well... it would be.. .inappropriate. Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone. Paige
F	PAIGE	What, is that your grown-up voice? That would be inappropriate, Paige.
M	RICK	No, Paige. What are you thinking? I'm a married man and I have a family. You think they'd like it if they knew I was hanging out at the lake, all alone, drinking beer with a college girl? She seems taken aback. I never said alone. My sorority's having a party down there tonight. Rick CLEARS HIS THROAT, tries to hide his embarrassment.
M	RICK	All right, better get inside. She opens the car door, then glares back at him.
F	PAIGE	Ewww. What the hell were you thinking?
M	RICK	Go ahead. Scoot along now. As she SLAMS the car door, we...
F	MAGGIE	Shhhh. He just fell asleep.
M	RICK	Awesome. Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into
F	EMMA	Can I sleep with you tonight?
M	RICK	No.
F	EMMA	Please.
M	RICK	No. Absolutely not. Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Are you serious? Look, besides the other thing, I don't like the fact that my daughter needs someone to sleep with every night--that's not going to be good when she goes off to college, you know. Maggie rolls her eyes.
F	EMMA	Well.. .can someone read me a story? Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter.
M	RICK	Okay, one quick story. Come on, jump on my back. Emma jumps on Rick's back. You can get started without me-- I'll be right back. Rick piggybacks Emma out of the room.
M	RICK	Okay, honey, this is the last pony and then night-night. Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him,
F	EMMA	There. You look pretty, Daddy.
M	RICK	Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and go to sleep. She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on
M	RICK (CONT'D)	I love you, Emma.
F	EMMA	I love you, too, Daddy. HIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP.
M	RICK	No. Please, no. Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep,
M	FRED	Hey.
M	RICK	Hey. How'd you make out?
M	FRED	Great. Lost both sets.
M	RICK	So'd you get the business? Fred nods and wipes his brow.
M	FRED	Pretty sure I got the Auto and Home. He told me to call his accountant on Monday about the Life.
M	RICK	Nice. Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with
M	FRED	Can you believe the talent here today? Yeah. I know. They NOTICE something O.S.. THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING
M	FRED	Ouch. Rick SIGHS.
M	RICK	CPR girl's back, too. Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING
M	FRED	Imagine if we were coming here back when we were single? Oh baby, the damage we would do.
F	EMMA	Monkey bars! The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.
M	GUNNAR	Me first! Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor
M	FRED	So you get lucky last night?
M	RICK	Nah, the kids were up when we got home. How 'bout you?
M	FRED	Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked right out so I snuck out to the car and rubbed one out. Rick shoots Fred a look.
M	RICK	The car? What are you Knight Rider? Why didn't you just go in the bathroom like a normal guy?
M	FRED	And get caught by Grace? Can't risk it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's where I lost my virginity. And they're comfy--I just put the seat back and turn on the tunes. The guys sit on a bench.
M	RICK	That's one of the things they don't tell you when you're young--that you'll still be jerking-off after you get married. I thought it was dust gonna be a teenage thing.
M	FRED	Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee
M	FRED (CONT'D)	You know what I miss the most?
M	RICK	What?
M	FRED	The arch.
M	RICK	What arch?
M	FRED	You know when you're taking a girl's panties off for the first time, and you're wondering if she's going to stop you, but then she gives you that little pelvic arch- thrust that tells you that the struggle's over, everything's going to be okay? Rick SIGHS.
M	RICK	That's a happy moment.
M	FRED	Yep. Another thing gone forever. Rick looks at his watch.
M	RICK	I should get going, I have to drop the kids off at a birthday party.
M	FRED	You want to grab a coffee after?
M	RICK	Do you have any interest in going down to the Patriot's training camp one of these days?
M	FRED	Are you kidding, I'd love that. Except...I always feel kind of pathetic waiting in line for Tom Brady's autograph.
M	RICK	Fred, I was planning on bringing the kids.
M	FRED	Genius! That's the perfect cover! Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S.
M	RICK	Uh-oh... HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe.
M	FRED	Did you see her face? Her face is tremendous.
M	RICK	Please don't have a nice ass, please don't have a nice ass... But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS
M	RICK (CONT'D	Oh, come on! That's ri iculous.
M	FRED	I know. She's from Australia. Been working here about a month.
M	RICK	Why'd you have to bring me here?!
M	FRED	Okay, cool it, tiger--here she comes. Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred. Iced coffee with two Splendas again? Fred wants to say yes, but just nods.
M	COFFEE GIRL (CONT'D)	How about your mate there? Uh...same. Her smile comes with a squint, which makes her eyes sparkle. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a WANNABE ARTIST-TYPE MALE EMPLOYEE,
M	COFFEE GIRL	Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin with that?
M	RICK	Uh, sure. What do you recommend?
M	COFFEE GIRL	They're all good. The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee
M	WANNABE	I'd go with the bran muffin--you guys are probably having digestive issues at your age, right? Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl.
M	RICK	I'll have a blueberry muffin please.
M	FRED	Make it a bran muffin for me. Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl Rick and Fred, now with coffees, sit at the rear of the shop.
M	RICK	Did you notice she's from Cleavage, Ohio?
M	FRED	Yeah. I bet her areolas look like a couple of pepperoni slices. Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and SQUINTS
M	RICK	What the hell are you doing?
M	FRED	Shh. I'm taking a mental photograph for my spank bank. Say cheese. Jesus Christ, guys, give it a rest. Rick and Fred turn to see ED LONG, tall, good-looking, mid-
M	RICK	Oh, hey, Ed. Didn't see you there.
F	ED	That's because you were shooting laser beams at the java babe.
M	RICK	Well, no, we were just--
F	ED	Come on, gentlemen, you're married men and she's half your age--grow
M	P-	The guys can't muster a response. So I guess I'll be seeing you at the house-warming party this weekend.
M	RICK	Hm?
F	ED	casa--we're inally in and we're having a little celebration.
M	RICK	Oh, I don't know if we can--
F	ED	Your wives already RSVP'd.
M	RICK	Right on.
F	ED	'Til then. Ed HOLDS OUT HIS FIST to them.
M	ED (CONT'D)	Come on, pound the potato. Rick and Fred reluctantly take turns TAPPING Ed's fist with What a d-bag.
M	RICK	He's right though. Fred looks at Rick. What are we doing sitting here gawking at her for? We're married men--it's creepy.
M	FRED	I don't see what the big deal is-- we're not hurting anyone. What is he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me what I can look at now? For God sakes, don't take that away from me- -it's all I got! As Rick thinks about this, we...
M	BAKER	Rick, you open. Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him
M	RICK	Four 9's.
M	FRED	Hey, where's Coakley? How come he didn't show?
F	GARY	Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals. The guys nod their approval.
M	BAKER	Man, imagine being Coakley? The guy's single, he's loaded, chicks love him, he doesn't have to answer to anybody.
F	GARY	That's the life.
M	FRED	That is the life.
M	HOG-HEAD	Let me ask you something: What would you guys pay to have your way with a Hawaiian Tropic girl for an entire weekend? The guys perk up as they think about this. You get to pick any one you want-- and you know up front that you won't get her pregnant, no diseases, you're never gonna hear from her again, and your wife will never find out.
F	GARY	How's it possible to know that my wife won't find out? It's not. I'm saying if it were possible, like if I was a magic genie and I could grant you this wish but then make it like it never even happened.
M	FLATS	But would I still have memory of it?
M	HOG-HEAD	Oh yeah. Great memories.
F	GARY	Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for that. Baker shoots him a look.
M	BAKER	You cheap,bastard. We're talking about an investment that gets your rocks off and protects your wife's feelings. I'd pay five grand.
M	RICK	Wow.
F	GARY	Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street, but us public school teachers aren't getting any of that bail-out money you're over-tipping everyone with. Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS.
F	MAGGIE	Hey, guys.
M	RICK	Oh, hey, honey. How was the book club?
F	MAGGIE	Great.
M	FRED	What did you guys read this month?
F	MAGGIE	Hemingway.
F	GARY	Old Man and the Sea?
F	MAGGIE	No, Muriel's yoga book. The guys LAUGH.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Actually, we were supposed to be discussing The Sun Also Rises but Grace pulled out a bottle of tequila and that was the end of that. So, did the kids go down easy?
M	RICK	Gunnar and Emma stalled for a while, but they weren't bad.
F	MAGGIE	How about the baby? Rick points to the BABY MONITOR in the middle of the table.
M	RICK	Not a peep.
F	MAGGIE	Great job. Now win some money, honey. She kisses Rick and walks out of the room.
F	GARY	I wish I could drink tequila. It's a great buzz but it always gives me the spins and then I have to go home early.
M	FRED	You want to know a sure cure for the spins? Fred puts a hand over his right eye.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Just cover up one eye. It balances out the equilibrium.
M	RICK	Or you could find a nice 12-step program.
F	MAGGIE	Oh, you poor thing... She hurries to the Baby and PICKS HIM UP.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Silly Daddy... he got the monitors mixed-up. Have you been listening to those loud-mouths all night? As Maggie moves to turn off the monitor, we HEAR:
M	FLATS (O.S.)	.So how 'bout you, Fred--how much would you pay to s end an entire weekend with one of the hottest women in the world? Maggie hesitates and LISTENS IN.
M	FRED (O.S.)	I wouldn't have to pay--I'm married to her. There's a BEAT, then the guys EXPLODE IN LAUGHTER.
M	FRED (O.S.) (CONT'D)	No, seriously, I'd pay five grand, easy. Maggie's JAW DROPS. I'd have to figure out a way to get it out of the bank without Grace noticing, but I suppose the genie could help me with that.
M	HOG-HEAD	You could put me down for seven- five.
M	BAKER	Pfttt. Hog-head, your ass doesn't have seven-five. More LAUGHTER from the guys as Rick deals out fresh bills.
M	FLATS	So what's your number, Rick?
M	RICK	Oh jeez, Flats, I don't know...
M	FRED	Come on.. any girl you choose. You get to do anything you want with her, and your wife will never find out. It's completely harmless, a one-time thing--what would you pay for that? BACK ON MAGGIE as she cradles her baby and LEANS CLOSER to
M	RICK (O.S.)	I honestly don't know, fellas.
M	BAKER (O.S.)	Ballpark. PUSH IN ON MAGGIE as she waits nervously for her husband's
M	RICK (O.S.)	Well... I've got a great wife and I sure wouldn't want to hurt her feelings, so... Maggie SMILES at this. That's my guy!
M	RICK (O.S.) (CONT'D)	I guess the real question is, what wouldn't I pay?! The guys LAUGH O.S. and MAGGIE REACTS, as we...
F	MAGGIE	What wouldn't you pay?!
M	RICK	I didn't really mean it, honey. They kind of put me on the spot. Look, some of the other guys were throwing out some pretty hefty bids.
F	MAGGIE	What does that have to do with anything?
M	RICK	Well... I'm the host of the party, I didn't want to be a buzz-kill. Maggie squints, appalled.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Look, all I was saying was, there's no amount of money I wouldn't pay to protect you and the kids.
F	MAGGIE	How is having sex with a hooker protecting me and the kids?
M	RICK	No one said anything about hookers.
F	MAGGIE	You were paying for sex--what would you call her? Well.. .the genie was getting the dough, not her. Come on, be reasonable, it was just guy-talk--it's not like it could really happen. Maggie shakes her head, disgusted, and leaves the room. Love you!
F	GRACE	Fred said five grand? What a blowhard!
F	MAGGIE	You know what's even funnier? Hog- head McCormick said he'd pay seven grand.
F	GRACE	What?! That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com bust--his wife supports him! The girls LAUGH.
M	GRACE (CONT'D)	Well, look on the bright side: At least they're not cheating on us.
F	MAGGIE	Sometimes I wonder if it would be better if they did cheat and get it over with.
F	DR. LUCY	You mean, rather than take the slow boat to resentment? The girls look to Dr. Lucy.
M	DR. LUCY (CONT'D	I'm just saying.. .maybe a little freedom would be good for them. And for you. Have you ever considered giving them a hall pass?
F	GRACE	A what?
F	DR. LUCY	A hall pass. A week off from marriage. Grace and Maggie stop chewing.
F	MAGGIE	Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let them go out and cheat?
F	DR. LUCY	I'm saying give them a week off from marriage. Look, most married men have foggy memories of their single days and they somehow get under the impression that if not for you, they'd be able to be with ail those women who entice them.
F	GRACE	That's Fred. He thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that I should be welcoming him at the door like some conquering hero. Dr. Lucy smiles.
F	DR. LUCY	Well, maybe it's time to let them go out there and find out what it's really like.
F	MAGGIE	Wow. You're talking about the nuclear option. Maggie ponders the idea.
F	GRACE	And remind me again, what good could possibly come from this...?
F	DR. LUCY	There's a wonderful principle in psychology called 'reactance theory.' It basically states that if you're constantly told you can't do something, you want to do it more than ever. And conversely, if you remove the taboo, you remove the obsession. Grace makes a 't' sound. I got an idea, Doc: Why don't you try a hall pass out on your husband and let us know how it works out.
F	DR. LUCY	Oh, I have. Grace and Maggie REACT to this.
F	MAGGIE	You're telling us you let Charlie sleep with another woman? Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering.
F	DR. LUCY	I am not telling you that. I am telling you that I gave him the freedom to choose for himself.
F	GRACE	And...?
F	DR. LUCY	All I know is...our marriage is better than ever. Grace and Maggie think about this.
F	GRACE	I don't know. There's a reason that men evolved and apes didn't. It's because women demanded more. Without a wife, Einstein would've been humping a maple tree all day. As the women LAUGH, we
F	GRACE	There he is! The lord of the manor!
F	ED	Come on, everyone in the shack! The grand tour's about to begin!
F	ED	I call it headquarters. LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife,
F	MANDY	Un-believable.
F	ED	That's sweet of you to say, Mandy.
M	LARRY	It's epic, Ed. Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR. And this over here--this is the war room. The temperature in there never goes above fifty-four degrees, never below fifty-three. I even threw in a back-up generator in case we lose power and the main generator doesn't kick in. Now who wants a Cubano? They're the real deal--Coakley snagged them on his trip to Havana.
M	KIMMY	Wait a second, Ed, first I want to show them Lny headquarters. Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes.
M	KIMMY	It's my paradise.
F	ED	With a price tag north of one hundred and forty large, it better be paradise. Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently POUNDS IT. Just
F	GRACE	Hey, where did Fred go? Rick turns and sees that he's missing.
M	RICK	What are you doing?
M	FRED	I can't take these look-at-how-much- I-own parties. It's obnoxious. Rick nods and sits down beside him.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	When I bought my completely-loaded Honda Odyssey, I didn't go around bragging about it, did I?
M	RICK	Well, kind of. You made me drive around town with you for two hours, remember? I thought you'd want to watch a movie in a mini-van. You never got to watch a movie in a mini-van before, did you? Rick shrugs.
M	RICK	Why'd you have to hook your boat up to it?
M	FRED	Because it's the Touring Edition, numb-skull. The thing can tow more weight than ninety percent of the pick-ups out there!
M	KIMMY	The mantle actually came all the way from Tuscany, which is in Europe.
F	ED	Hey, gang, check this out.
M	KIMMY	Oh God, Eddie, they don't need to see that--they'll think we're wackos. Ed PUNCHES A CODE into a keypad and the WALL SLIDES OPEN
F	MAGGIE	Oh my God... this is like secret agent stuff.
M	KIMMY	I think having a safe room is a bit over the top, but Ed feels with our two little ones you can never be too cautious.
F	GRACE	Aw, you're such a good daddy.
F	MAGGIE	Rick can't even set up the baby monitors right. Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred ENTER the
F	ED	Here come Tweedle-dee and Tweedle- dum. CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - we see Rick and Fred cross over to
M	RICK (ON MONITOR)	.All I'm saying is, who gets a mini-van when you don't even have any kids?
M	FRED (ON MONITOR)	You don't know much about the insurance game, do you, Rick? When you pull into a person's driveway to sell them life insurance, who do you think they'd rather see? A hot- shot in a Porsche or a family man in a mini-van? Hm? Rick looks around the empty room.
M	RICK (ON MONITOR)	Hey, where'd everyone go? Guys, we're in here!
M	KIMMY	They can't hear you. The room's completely soundproof.
F	ED	And bulletproof. ON VIDEO MONITOR WALL - we see Rick and Fred LEAVE ONE SCREEN
M	RICK	They must've gone downstairs. Fred motions to Ed's humidor room. Thanks for coming to the war room, old chap. By the way, did I mention that my wife's vagina never goes above fifty-four degrees, nor below fifty-three.
F	GRACE	Uh, maybe we should turn this off. But Ed turns THE VOLUME UP. CLOSE ON MONITOR - Rick plays along with a BAD BRITISH
M	RICK (ON MONITOR)	Is that so, dear boy? And what happens if you lose power during a big blow and your main generator doesn't kick in?
M	FRED (ON MONITOR)	Well that's why I had the back-up generator installed in Kimmy's rumpus. Kimmy makes a face, shocked.
F	GRACE	Here we go...
M	RICK	Hey, speaking of installations, is that a shiny new set of cans on Mandy Bohac?
M	FRED	Either that or she's wearing her daughter's t-shirt.
M	RICK	They look good but I'll still take the real deal any day.
M	FRED	Right. You're telling me you'd take Kimmy Long's flapjacks over Mandy's new speedbags?
M	RICK	That's what I'm telling you. I like boobs with a little mileage on 'em. They're more fun.
M	FRED	Fun?
M	RICK	Yeah. You can smoosh 'em, swing 'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong 'em.
M	FRED	And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas?
M	KIMMY	You people are horrible! Horrible! I'm very disappointed, gentlemen!
M	FRED	Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone? Grace YANKS the mini-van to the side of the road and GLARES
F	GRACE	Large-mouth vaginas?! As the guys cower, we
F	MAGGIE	You know what really troubles me? The thing that you're all so obsessed with is meaningless to you. It's really just about numbers with you guys. Rick looks up, confused.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Rick, you can't even tel me the month you lost your virginity. I can tell you the exact day and hour that I lost mine. Rick seems a little embarrassed by this.
M	RICK	Well, virginity is different for guys.
F	MAGGIE	The point is, obviously I like sex, too--it means something to me--but I don't walk around gawking at every guy I see.
M	RICK	All right, so I occasionally notice other women. I'm sorry.
F	MAGGIE	Occasionally? Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come
M	RICK	Okay, you want the truth? You really want me to pull back the curtain here? From the moment I leave the house in the morning 'til the moment I get home, I pretty much notice every woman in my path. Maggie turns to face him.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	But it's not how you think it is, Mags. It's like... it's like a curse. I don't want to notice, but I can't help it. It's always been like that. I figured that when I c jot married that would be it, but it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give two shits about marriage. So what are you saying--you're not happy with our sex life? Rick reaches up and takes her hand.
M	RICK	No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our sex life is great--not that I wouldn't mind a little more, but-- look, one thing has nothing to do with the other. I think about sex a lot--all guys do--that's just the way it is. Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope.
F	MAGGIE	I'm giving you a hall pass.
M	RICK	A what?
F	MAGGIE	One week off from marriage.
M	RICK	You mean, like a trial separation? You are seriously overreacting.
F	MAGGIE	It's not a separation, it's a hall pass. You can do whatever you want. Get it out of your system. Wait a minute--are you for real?
F	MAGGIE	It's not a yes or no offer, and it's not a debate. You're getting a hall pass. As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick.
M	RICK	'Morning.
F	MAGGIE	There's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you.
M	RICK	I'm gonna have to take them to go, hon, I've got a showing in fifteen minutes. Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Hey, about this hall pass business.. .1 don't want it and I don't need it. All I need is--
F	MAGGIE	I told you, this isn't negotiable. She turns and faces him.
M	RICK	You're really serious about this?
F	MAGGIE	Rick, this isn't something that I...look, I really think you need this. I think we need this. Rick doesn't know what to say.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	This afternoon I'm taking the kids out to my parent's beach house. Rick REACTS to this.
M	RICK	For how long?
F	MAGGIE	We'll be back in one week. And as far as I'm concerned, starting right now. .. you have the week off from marriage.
M	RICK	Hey, what are you doing here?
M	FRED	I called your office and they told me you were in the neighborhood. Rick turns to the couple.
M	RICK	Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred Searing. Fred, this is Harold and Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up here from Long Island.
M	FRED	Well, mazel tov, folks. The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Here, let me give you my card. Home, auto, or life insurance--I'm the go-to mensch in town.
M	HAROLD GOLDBERG	We're good on insurance. Rick quickly jumps in.
M	RICK	Uh, why don't you two take another look around and if you have any questions I'll be right here.
M	HAROLD GOLDBERG	Thank you. The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them. What the he 1 are you doing--I'm trying to make a sale here.
M	FRED	You weren't picking up your cell--I wanted to see how much trouble you got in last night. You know what Grace made me do? She made me call the Longs and apologize. Rick flinches.
M	RICK	Oof .
M	FRED	How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out when you got home?
M	RICK	Uh... sort of. Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's She gave me a hall pass.
M	FRED	A what?
M	RICK	A week off from marriage to do whatever I want. She's going to her parents' house down the Cape 'til next Sunday. Fred SNICKERS.
M	FRED	Yeah, right.
M	RICK	I'm serious.
M	FRED	You're full of shit.
M	RICK	Fred, it's true. You think I could make something like this up? Fred stares at him.
M	FRED	I don't get it--why aren't you more excited?
M	RICK	Well...I don't know how I feel.
M	FRED	About...?
M	RICK	The hall pass. Something about it isn't right.
M	FRED	You mean, like, you think Maggie might have a brain tumor or something?
M	RICK	No. I mean, just because my wife tells me it's okay to cheat... is it?
M	FRED	Uh, yeah. Why can't you just accept the fact that your wife is a goddamn saint, Rick? She's evolved. Don't you see? She gets it!
M	RICK	Yeah, but there's a part of me that's saying, 'Wow, you must have pushed her pretty hard to get her to this point.' And is that good for a marriage? That your wife is willing to try something this insane? Fred can't believe his ears.
M	FRED	Absolutely! Come on, doesn't it bother you that our wives dreams all come true, but ours don't? Look at Maggie; when she was a kid she played house--you g a ve her a house. She played with her E-Z-Bake Oven--you bought her a Viking. She played mommy--you made her a mommy.
M	RICK	The oven's a GE.
M	FRED	It's a real gas oven! And what about you, huh? Come on, man, your wife is living her dreams.. .and now it's time for you to live yours. As Rick thinks about this, we
M	FRED	I don't know, I think this is some very forward-thinking on Maggie's part.
F	GRACE	Quit lobbying--you're not getting a hall pass. And you mark my words, this is going to end up biting Maggie in the ass. At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her.
M	FRED	Why would I need a hall pass? I've got you.
F	GRACE	Not tonight you don't. I'm too bloated and I have cramps.
M	FRED	I don't mind.
F	GRACE	Fred, do I have to spell it out for you? I'm having my period. Yeah, I got that. He moves in for a kiss but she pulls away.
F	GRACE	Come on, hon, give me a break. Not tonight. Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom. Oh, shit--I forgot to take the trash out. Officer #1 gets out of the driver's side. He DISAPPEARS FROM
M	CAR.	The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred The police lights are FLASHING now and several NEIGHBORS have All right, ma'am, if you say he's yours.. .you can have him. The Officer TAKES OFF FRED'S HANDCUFFS.
F	GRACE	Thank you, officers. Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go...
M	FRED	I got a Hall Pass!
M	RICK	How?
M	FRED	Doesn't matter how. I got one. Can you believe it?! I got a hall pass! Rick stands up, elated.
M	RICK	And I've got a hall pass!
M	FRED	We both have hall passes!
M	RICK	When does yours start? Fred looks at his watch.
M	FRED	Twenty-three minutes ago! She just left for the Cape--she's staying with Maggie. It's just you and me for the next six days!
M	RICK	Oh my God, do you realize how much easier this is going to make it-- having a hall pass partner?
M	FRED	And it's not just me--Baker, Gary, and Hog-head are coming out with us tonight!
M	RICK	No way?! They got hall passes, too?!
M	FRED	No, no, no--they just want to watch. Rick grows concerned.
M	RICK	You think that's a good idea, letting them in on it? What if they blab and it gets around town--it might embarrass our wives.
M	FRED	Don't worry, I already talked to them. Their lips are sealed. Rick and Fred smile.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	We're living the dream, baby! Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: Five MGD's, my friend. While waiting for the beers, the guys CHECK OUT THE SCENE.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	The guy at the Holiday Inn Express told me this place really kicks in around nine-thirty.
M	BAKER	Hey, why are you staying at a hotel if your wives are out of town?
M	FRED	Well, we can't very well take babes back to our places--if they know where we live they might end up stalking us.
M	RICK	Besides, I wouldn't be able to concentrate with all the pictures everywhere and the kids' cut-outs all over the fridge.
F	GARY	Yeah, isn't it weird how your own kids can creep you out sometimes? Rick shoots Gary a look.
M	FRED	I get the feeling there's a lot of divorcees in this place.
M	HOG-HEAD	That's good. Divorcees are into kinky sex--that's why they're divorced. Just then the BARTENDER arrives with the Miller Genuine
M	HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)	So come on, point out which girls you guys are gonna do tonight. Gary elbows Fred as he spots TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN at the end
F	GARY	What about those two? Why don't you bang them?
M	FRED	No way. They're doing the
M	SWEATSHIRT-AROUND-THE-WAIST THING--	they're obviously hiding something back there.
F	GARY	Okay, how about the blonde hostess? Maybe somebody should nail her, huh?
M	RICK	Attempt to be cool, Gary--we've got a whole week. Baker looks around at the lame bar scene.
M	BAKER	Are you guys sure that Applebee's is the best place to be picking up women?
M	RICK	What are you thinking--Olive Garden?
F	GARY	Nah, that's only good on Thursday nights.
M	HOG-HEAD	Hey, what about the auto show? Baker shoots them a look.
M	BAKER	Are you guys for real?
F	GARY	Wait a second--where's Coakley? That's where we should be.
M	BAKER	He's in Iceland.
M	RICK	What's he doing there?
M	BAKER	What do you think he's doing there? The guys all nod at this, proud of him.
M	RICK	Look, before we go bagging any chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef in me.
F	GARY	Hey, I got a guy over at Outback Steak House who could set us up.
M	BAKER	Ooooh, he's got pull over at Outback. Wow.
M	RICK	Hey, I like Outback. Let's chug these and hit the road. As the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary.
M	HOG-HEAD	Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have any connections at 7/11, do ya? Maybe someone could hook me up with a player's card so I can cut right to the front of the raspberry slurpy line. The guys all LAUGH, as we
F	GRACE	I think we might've made a huge mistake.
F	MAGGIE	Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why don t you just try to get some sleep? Grace turns to Maggie.
F	GRACE	Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't understand you--how can you Just sit there and read knowing that Rick could be making out with a supermodel right now? Maggie doesn't answer.
M	GRACE (CONT'D)	Our husbands aren't married this week. Do you know what husbands do when they're not married?
F	MAGGIE	Shh. You're going to wake the kids.
F	GRACE	Are you going to sit there and tell me you're not the least bit concerned about what they're doing right now? Maggie SIGHS.
F	MAGGIE	Okay... I'm a little concerned. Grace flops into the chair across from her.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Of course I'm concerned. But what choice did we have?
F	GRACE	We could've kept the status quo. I mean, were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme?
F	MAGGIE	For me they were. Look, you may call this a hall pass, but for me it's more of a Hail Mary pass. I'm serious, I don't know what else to do. Grace looks at Maggie, surprised.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Remember last week when we went to Lucy's award thing? Grace nods. That night when we got home, Rick and I were gonna.. .you know... and I was waiting for him in bed while he tucked the kids in, and I started wondering who he would be thinking about during sex. Would it be the girl he checked out on the way into the party? Or would it be Missy Frankenfield--because I noticed him gawking at her? Or how about one of the waitresses, or maybe somebody he saw at work that day? Then when he came into the room, I did something I'd never done before: I pretended to be asleep.
F	GRACE	You're kidding me? You've never done that? I do that all the time! Maggie almost smiles.
F	MAGGIE	Look, I understand that people have fantasies and that you're not always thinking about the person you're with.
F	GRACE	That's for sure.
F	MAGGIE	But it's just...I don't know... it's been too long since I felt that he was thinking about me. They sit there for a moment, quiet. Then:
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	I need this hall pass to work, Grace, because if it doesn't, I don't know what's going to happen.
M	BAKER	Okay... so where to now? Rick can't think in this state.
M	RICK	Fred...?
M	FRED	Hm?
M	RICK	Answer Baker.
M	FRED	What's the question?
M	RICK	What are we doing for the rest of the night? I don't know. Getting laid, right?
M	HOG-HEAD	I gotta go home and poo.
M	BAKER	Now?
M	HOG-HEAD	Yeah, I put too much Hollandaise on the mozzarella sticks.
F	GARY	Why don't you just back one out here?
M	HOG-HEAD	I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need a bath afterwards. Baker musters some initiative and STANDS UP.
M	BAKER	Come on, you guys! I say we go to a strip club and smoke cigars-- that 11 wake us up!
M	RICK	I got a better idea. Rick STRETCHES.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Let's go night-night.
M	BAKER	What?
M	RICK	I say we tie a bow on it and put her to bed. This is gonna be a long week so we should pace ourselves. Baker looks at his watch.
M	BAKER	It's only nine-thirty!
M	FRED	I'm with Rico. Freddy tie-tie. Are you guys serious?
M	RICK	Relax, guys, this is just the calm before the storm. Get out the plywood and batten down the hatches.
M	FRED	That's right. Tonight we build up strength, tomorrow we make landfall. Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:
M	HOG-HEAD	Wow. This place sure beats the hell out of the Holiday Inn Express. Why aren't you staying here?
M	RICK	Too pricey. Besides, since we're paying for golf we get full access to the resort--including the pool bar.
M	FRED	Mothers, lock up your daughters-- the dogs are off the leash!
M	RICK	Turn-and-burn, baby! Gary raises his hand for a HIGH-FIVE, but Rick balks.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Nope. I don't do that.
M	HOG-HEAD	Hey, I say screw the golf--let's go straight to the pool bar and start getting you guys laid!
M	RICK	Hoch-head, relax, the pool bar ain't going nowhere. Besides, it'll be good for us to get a little sun before making our grand entrance-- chicks love a healthy glow.
M	FRED	Plus it wouldn't hurt to work up a little sweat--get those pheromones flying. Just then, two sexy BEER-CART GIRLS wave as they pass.
M	HOG-HEAD	You talked me into it.
F	GARY	Hey, guys, look what I brought. Gary holds up a ZIPLOCK BAG full of something chocolatey.
M	RICK	What's that?
F	GARY	Pot brownskies. The guys all look at one another, baffled.
M	RICK	What, are we on spring break? Where the hell'd you get those?
F	GARY	I got an in.
M	FRED	With who?
F	GARY	Guy who washes my dog. Go ahead. He holds out the bag and the guys hesitate.
M	GARY (CONT'D)	Eating it isn't like smoking it. It's a much mellower buzz--you'll just feel relaxed.
M	HOG-HEAD	Are they chocolatey? As Hog-Head SNIFFS the brownies, Rick takes a practice swing.
M	RICK	Hog-head, come on, who eats pot brownies at eleven in the morning when they're playing golf?
M	HOG-HEAD	John Daly?
F	GARY	And by the way, Rick, this is spring break! You've got a hall pass! Live it up, man! It'll probably help your rap with the ladies later.
M	HOG-HEAD	Gary's right--when are we ever gonna get the chance to do pot brownies again? Hog-Head takes a brownie and BITES INTO IT.
M	HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)	Mmm. These are yummy.
M	RICK	You don't even have a hall pass.
M	HOG-HEAD	So? I can still live vicariously through you guys, can't I?
M	RICK	It's not vicarious if you're actually doing it.
M	HOG-HEAD	Whatever. Just hit your ball. Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE.
M	FRED	Oh, what the hell, it's not like my game can get any worse. Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT.
M	RICK	All right, give me one of those things. As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we
M	FRED	What kind of soap do you use? You mean in the shower?
M	FRED	Yeah.
M	RICK	Dove.
M	FRED	Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry your skin so much. Fred stares into space.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Sometimes it's hard to wash off, though. Because of the moisturizer. You ever notice--?
M	RICK	I think Hog-head's dead. Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN Hog-head...? Are you okay? As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an
M	RANGER	What the hell is he doing? Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority
M	RICK	Uh, he's having back spasms.
M	RANGER	Not him. Him. Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the Gary! What are you doing?!
F	GARY	I don't know--you tell me! Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick,
M	RANGER	Look, this is the third time I've had to flag your group and you're only on the fourth hole. Now if I have to come out here again, you're done for the day.
M	RICK	Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir. The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO
M	RICK	Think. Where did you last see it?
F	GARY	On the course.
M	RICK	Where on the course?
F	GARY	I don't know--on a fairway, I think. I clot out, grabbed my club, took a swing, and when I turned around it had disappeared.
M	RICK	You're serious? You're telling us you lost your golf cart? Dude, where's my golf cart?
M	RICK	Shut up, Fred.
M	HOG-HEAD	Guys, I gotta go poo again.
F	GARY	I didn't lose it, I think it was stolen. Who would steal a golf cart? Gary shrugs.
F	GARY	Criminals?
M	HOG-HEAD	Does anyone have any napkins?
F	GARY	Look, all I know is I had it on the seventh tee and now it's gone.
M	RICK	What are you talking about? We're only on the sixth hole.
F	GARY	What? Did we miss a hole? Where's my kids? Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it
M	RICK	Oh, come on, man! ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading
M	FRED	Run for it! The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick
F	GARY	He's gaining on us!
M	RICK	I can't go any faster, I've got it floored!
M	FRED	Cut through the woods! Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and
M	7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER	Hey, Mom, look! The family turns to see... THEIR POV - a stoned-looking Rick, Fred, Hog-head and Gary
M	FRED	Ed. Kimmy. Clones. The light changes and as the golf cart DRIVES OFF through the BACK ON ED AND KIMMY shaking their heads.
M	KIMMY	Their poor wives. Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: The PLAYERS and FANS mingle on the field immediately after Grace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch
M	GERRY	Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming out and supporting us.
F	MAGGIE	Oh, it was fun. You guys looked good.
M	GERRY	Thanks. Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging So...we saw you sitting up there with those little kids--are you nannies or something? The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile.
F	MAGGIE	No, they're my kids. Yeah, right. You have three kids?
F	MAGGIE	Uh-huh. A couple other PLAYERS amble over.
M	GERRY	Dudes, they're not nannies, they're mommies.
M	PLAYER #2	No way?!
F	GRACE	Well, she is, not me. I'm not old enough yet. Maggie and the players LAUGH.
M	RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)	Guys! The players turn to see their coach, RICK COLEMAN,
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	Time to pack things up--let's go! The Players quickly scatter.
M	MAGGIE'S FATHER	Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman- -the coach. Rick Coleman is a granite-jawed 38-year-old with a good head
M	RICK COLEMAN	I hope those clowns weren't bothering you.
F	MAGGIE	Oh, no, they were sweet.
F	GRACE	Yeah. Cute kids.
F	MAGGIE	So you're the guy who's been taking money off my dad every Saturday on the golf course?
M	RICK COLEMAN	I hate to break it to you but your old man's the one who's been taking all the money--he's a thief. Maggie's Father LAUGHS.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	Hey, everyone's coming back to my place for some beers and a barbecue- -why don't you join us?
F	MAGGIE	Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the kids home.
M	MAGGIE'S FATHER	Your mom and I will take 'em home. You two go out and have a good time- -cripes, you haven't been out all week. Grace perks up at this.
F	MAGGIE	Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really
F	GRACE	Excuse me, can I have a word with you? Grace pulls Maggie aside. What's your problem?
F	MAGGIE	Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are barely out of college, and, in case you've forgotten, we're married.
F	GRACE	To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred had the week off from marriage. So remind me again--who are we married to? Maggie thinks about this.
F	MAGGIE	Well...I guess one beer won't kill us. That's my girl. Grace glances over at the ballplayers.
M	GRACE (CONT'D)	Why shouldn't we have fun? God knows our guys are living it up. What would you guys rather do--make- out with a guy or let him blow you? PULL BACK TO REVEAL that...
M	HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)	And you've gotta pick one or someone in your family will die-- that's the rule.
F	GARY	Oh boy, that's a toughie.
M	FRED	How long would you have to make-out with him?
M	HOG-HEAD	Ten minutes.
M	RICK	Tongue?
M	HOG-HEAD	Of course.
M	FRED	And how long would he have to blow you?
M	HOG-HEAD	Seven minutes.
F	GARY	Oof. I mean, getting blown by a dude is bad, but making out with a guy, it's so.. .intimate.
M	RICK	You think it's more intimate than getting blown by a guy?
F	GARY	Way more.
M	BAKER	All right, the hell with this shit, I'm outta here. Baker gets up from his stool. What? Why?
M	BAKER	I wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks, not talk about dicks.
M	FRED	Hey, greased lightning, let off the gas--sometimes these things take time.
F	GARY	Baker's right. This is day three and you haven't even talked to a girl. That's not exactly accurate, Gary. Thanks to your scrumptious brownies, I did spend half of last night talking to Judy on the drug- and-poison hotline. Hog-head and Gary stand.
M	HOG-HEAD	I guess I'm gonna get going, too.
F	GARY	Yeah, this is boring. You guys are pussies.
M	FRED	Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk to any girls.
M	BAKER	We don't have hall passes! Come on, guys, let's go. The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and
M	HOG-HEAD	Hey, guys, it's all right if you strike-out.. .but for godsakes, at least take a couple of swings. A moment later the guys are gone and a humbled Rick and Fred This is actually good--you know, that they're leaving. You don't need five hunters to bag two birds.
M	RICK	No, you do not. And I love those guys but, let's be honest, they're not exactly chick-magnets.
M	FRED	You can say that again. Yep, the steak always looks better if you trim away some of the fat. And let's face it, we are the steak.
M	RICK	Dream team, baby. The guys CLINK BEERS. Then:
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Maybe we should call the girls and ask them to come home. Fred glances at him, aghast.
M	FRED	What?
M	RICK	Who are we kidding, man? Do you really think we're going to be picking up any girls this week?
M	FRED	Why wouldn't we?
M	RICK	Because that's not us anymore.
M	FRED	Wait a second. You want to quit?
M	RICK	Fred, we're not the same guys we were fifteen years ago, back when we were single. We've changed. Fred stares at him, incredulous.
M	FRED	No, man, you've changed. All you care about is yourself--what about all the guys out there who are counting on us to make this thing work?
M	RICK	What are you talking about?
M	FRED	Don't you get it? We're the chosen ones! Fred stands up and points at Rick.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	That's right--this thing is bigger than us! Our wives didn't give us this hall pass, the good Lord did! And what do we have to show for it? Nothing.
M	RICK	Come off it, Fred. Obviously hooking up isn't something we really want--if it was, we could've done it by now.
M	FRED	Could we have? Rick is taken aback by this. Well ...of course. I mean, if we'd really wanted to.
M	FRED	Guess what? I did want to. And you know how close I got? We're three days in and the only woman I've spoken to was our waitress at Outback. And she never even made eye-contact.
M	RICK	I don't really care if some waitress makes eye-contact. I want to go home--I miss my wife and kids.
M	FRED	Let me explain something to you: If Grace and Maggie find out we can't get laid on our own, they'll start thinking we need them to get laid. Do you know what that'll do to the balance of power in our homes? It'll destroy it! Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed.
M	RICK	Well, what if we just tell them that we did hook up?
M	FRED	We can't. Grace'll know. She always knows when I'm lying.
M	RICK	Hey, what about a massage parlor?
M	FRED	No! That's giving up. Fred glares at him. You don't get it, do you? A hall pass ain't all about sex. It's about being man enough to pick up a woman even though you may not be what--in the traditional sense--is considered... .good-looking, or... .appealing. Rick seems stung by this news.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Look, if we can't show that something positive can come from having a hall pass, then the whole concept is dead. Not just for us...but for all mankind. Rick thinks about this for a moment, then stands up with a
M	RICK	All right, let's get out of here. I know exactly where we should be. ANGLE ON Maggie and Rick Coleman sipping beers while in the
F	MAGGIE	So how about you, Rick, do you have any children?
M	RICK COLEMAN	Nah, but maybe some day. Your mom keeps talking about hooking me up with your cousin Kate. Maggie LAUGHS.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	That's not a good sign.
F	MAGGIE	No, I hardly know her. She moved to Miami when I was eight.
M	RICK COLEMAN	That's what your mom said. I coach at the University of Miami.
F	MAGGIE	Then you should go out with her.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Nice try. So how about yourself--how long you been married?
F	MAGGIE	Uh...fourteen years. We were college sweethearts.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Nice. And where is he this week?
F	MAGGIE	He's up in Boston.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Poor guy. All work and no play, huh? Maggie forces a smile.
F	MAGGIE	Something like that. Suddenly Grace is PROPELLED OUT OF THE WATER and UP ONTO
F	GRACE	Stop it! What are you doing?! Gerry LAUGHS and BOUNCES AROUND THE POOL and Grace and Maggie Chicks dig motorcycles. ". .Oh-oh here she comes, watch out boy she'll chew you up. Oh-oh here she comes, she's a maneater..." ANGLE ON THE BAR where Rick and Fred are checking out the
M	FRED	Jackpot, baby. Rick NOTICES SOMETHING O.S..
M	RICK	How about those two? ANGLE ON two pretty LATINO WOMEN sitting alone at a table.
M	FRED	Ooh, yeah. Daddy likes. Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands
M	RICK	What's this?
M	FRED	I went on-line this afternoon and wrote down some good pick-up lines to break the ice. 'Hi. Will you help me find my puppy? I think he ran into the cheap hotel across the street.'
M	FRED	That's a good one--except for one thing: We don't have a puppy, so when she gets there she'll realize we're full of shit. Rick shoots him a look.
M	RICK	I don't think it's supposed to be for real. It's just to make her laugh so she'll talk to you. Fred considers this.
M	FRED	Oh God no, it doesn't work on that level. Here, this is my favorite. He takes the paper from Rick. 'You must be from Ireland because when I look at you my penis is Dublin.'
M	RICK	It's a charmer but you know what? We don't need phony pick-up lines. Why don't we just be ourselves?
M	FRED	Great. If you know how to. Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself.
M	RICK	Give me the helmet. Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Hi. The women give him a pleasant look.
M	LATINO WOMAN #1	Hello. Fred gives a little wave from behind Rick.
M	FRED	Hola. LONG BEAT as Rick tries to figure what to say next. Then:
M	RICK	Well.. .this is awkward. I feel like I'm back at my first junior high school mixer. Rick and Fred force a LAUGH and the girls smile. Another So...are you ladies from Ireland?
M	LATINO WOMAN #2	No.
M	RICK.	I'm very surprised to hear that news, because when I look at you my penis doubles in size. The women FLINCH at this, losing their smiles. Fred leans in.
M	FRED	No, he means his dick is Dublin. Like the city. In Ireland. As the girls turn away from them, we begin a... Rick and Fred are at the bar looking TIRED and FRUSTRATED.
M	RICK	I have this overwhelming urge to donkey-kick everyone in this bar.
M	FRED	Okay, tiger, keep your chin up--no one said this was going to be easy. Even in college you had to take fifty rejections for every score, remember?
M	RICK	Yeah, but it didn't sting so much when I was drunk. Fred perks up.
M	FRED	That's it! We should be drinking!
M	RICK	You're right. We're too stiff.
M	FRED	Way too stiff. We gotta start pounding 'em, get those creative juices flowing, bring the soul to the surface. Rick smiles.
M	RICK	That's when we're at our most charming! A HAMMERED Fred is HOLDING A HAND OVER ONE EYE as he SHOUTS
M	FRED	You say no to me? You say no to me?! I SAY NO TO YOU! He's being restrained by an unusually patient BOUNCER. In
M	BOUNCER	Come on, buddy, let's go... The women glare at Fred with disgust, maybe even a little
M	FRED	No, screw them! You think your shit don't stink?! Well I got news for ya: I wouldn't titty-bang you in a snow storm!
M	20-SOMETHING WOMAN	Oh, please, sir, please titty-bang us in a snow storm! The women LAUGH.
M	FRED	Nope, you blew it, not gonna happen.
M	BOUNCER	There you go, mister, you got 'em good. Now let's go. As the Bouncer drags him toward the exit, a STUNNING GIRL Hey, sweetie, you need a pole for that flag? Just then, the Girl's LARGE BOYFRIEND appears, and as his Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:
M	FRED	I know what we've been doing wrong. Rick lifts his chin.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	If we're gonna break out of this slump, we've got to start using our strength. And that is.. .people who know us, like us. So we should go after the women we've already won over.
M	RICK	You mean like our wives?
M	FRED	Yeah, like that, but not them. Fred sits in the chair across from Rick.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	I was thinking Coffee Girl.
M	RICK	You've won over Coffee Girl?
M	FRED	Well, I'm sure she'd recognize me. Rick thinks about this.
M	RICK	Look, if you really want to go after someone you already know, have you considered Missy Frankenfield? Fred's listening.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	She's got all the stats you like-- she's beautiful, you k now her phone n ow- number, she's freshly divorced...
M	FRED	Which according to Hog-head means she's horny.
M	RICK	Bingo. As Fred smiles, we
M	GERRY	What's up, beach bunnies? Grace and Maggie sit up and smile.
F	GRACE	What are you doing here? He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY
M	GRACE & MAGGIE	Gerry, stop it!
M	GERRY	Hey, where are the kiddies? We thought we'd take you all for a boat ride.
F	MAGGIE	My parents took them to Martha's Vineyard for the weekend. Just then, we hear a LOUD HORN. They look up to see the boat All right, everybody aboard! We're going waterskiing! The two women look at each other--why not? As they get up
M	WANNABE	Can I take your order? Rick sees that there's no one behind him. He turns to the
M	RICK	Uh...I don't know what I want. Wannabe stares at him, waiting. Rick hesitates a few
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Look, man, I want her to take my order.
M	WANNABE	Why?
M	RICK	Uh, she knows how I like it. Little help, Leigh--your unique barista skills have been requested. Rick waves weakly to Leigh and winks. As Leigh approaches,
F	LEIGH	Hi. What would you like? Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is
M	RICK	Iced coffee. With two Splendas. Leigh rings him up.
F	LEIGH	That'll be two dollars. Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers.
M	RICK	By the way, nice tunes. Do you choose 'em or do they come down from corporate?
F	LEIGH	Me. It's Snow Patrol. She hands Rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar.
M	RICK	Nice soundtrack. Pretty solid movie, too. Wannabe BARKS out a LAUGH.
M	WANNABE	Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s-- the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick. This is Snow Patrol, the band. Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed.
F	LEIGH	Thanks for the tip. As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe
M	WANNABE	Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee, mister. Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe.
M	RICK	Why are you smiling? You think this counter is some alligator-infested moat? Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	This little 'I'm-on-the-inside, too- cool-for-school, let's-laugh-at-the-
M	ON-THIS-SIDE-OF-THE-COUNTER'	routine's gonna get you hurt. After you lose all of your family's money on your avante garde piece of crap short film, you're going to need a job. And it's guys like me that hire. And guys like me don't hire punks like you. So shape up. As Rick turns and walks out, we PAN over to see that Leigh
M	LEIGH (O.S.)	I work-out there. Rick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh.
M	RICK	You do? Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	I work-out at home, but I was thinking of going public with my work-outs. What do you squat? She seems amused by this.
F	LEIGH	I don't really squat, just run on the hamster-wheel everyday after work. She starts wiping down a table.
M	COFFEE GIRL	So did you go to Harvard? She nods at Rick's t-shirt.
M	RICK	Yeah. I mean, you know...I went to a party there once. Coffee Girl GIGGLES and Rick perks up. Actually, this is Harvard Health Care. Sleep apnea... snoring too much. So is this a good place to join?
F	LEIGH	Great place. Real chill. And they have a bar, so I always grab a beer after my workout.
M	RICK	Bitchin'. Sounds like a nice routine. Maybe I'll routine it, too.
F	LEIGH	If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent you--they'll give me two free months.
M	RICK	I'll do that, Leigh.
F	LEIGH	Rockin'. Leigh gives him the peace sign.
M	RICK	R-O-C-K in the U-S-A. Leigh smiles and as she heads back inside, we
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD (V.0.)	Hi, this is Missy. Sorry I missed your call. I'm out of town for a few days, and I may have limited cell reception. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. BEEP. Fred mouths the word 'shit', then picks up the receiver.
M	FRED	Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing. I . uh, I dust wanted to give you a ring and, um...well, give me a call when you get back. It's kind of an emergency. Well, not life- threatening, but-- The machine CUTS HIM OFF. Fred HANGS UP, dejected. He sits PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he's outside a MASSAGE PARLOR. As
M	FRED	Oh, hi. Kimmy nods blankly. The Daughter glares at him. Fred
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Um, I don't think I got a chance to tell you how impressed I was with your new place. Absolutely elegant. Kimmy GRUNTS a thank you and turns away from him.
M	DRY CLEAN KOREAN LADY	Mr. Searing, you pick up last week-- no more clothes here! Fred smiles uncomfortably at Kimmy.
M	FRED	That's right... Well, gotta get going--I have a meeting across town in ten minutes. See ya. Fred EXITS.
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN	You want massage? Fred looks around. There's an OLD KOREAN LADY sitting on a
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)	You fill out. The Young Korean Woman hands Fred a form. Fred puts it down
M	FRED	I'd prefer no paper trail.
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN	Need for insurance company.
M	FRED	I don't think my insurance company's gonna cover this one.
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN	Ten dollar co-pay?
M	FRED	Uh, no.
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN	Fill out form. It policy. Fred moves in closer.
M	FRED	Look, I don't really want this in print. The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form.
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN	How I know what you want if you no fill out form?
M	FRED	Um, couldn't I just tell you? She stares at him for a LONG BEAT.
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN	So, what you waiting for?! Fred glances back at the Old Korean Lady, then WHISPERS in
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)	Okay.. .but must see I.D. first. Fred SIGHS and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill.
M	FRED	How about a C-note so I don't have to fill out any forms or show any I.D.'s? The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then
M	YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN	Gentleman want a rub-and-tug with tea-bag happy ending but don't fill out form! Kimmy Long glares at him, appalled. As Fred backpedals OUT
M	SONG	.Night fever, night fever.. .we know how to do it...' As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick The crowd soon FORMS A CIRCLE around the two couples, and as Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat
M	RICK COLEMAN	Wow. You can really move out there. Maggie shrugs modestly.
F	MAGGIE	Thanks. I was a dance major in college.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Really? I always wondered--what do you do with a degree in dance?
F	MAGGIE	Well, as it turned out, nothing. I guess the original plan was to go to New York and try to hook-up with one of the big dance companies, but then I got married and. . .your priorities change. She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Anyway, that was fun. I haven't danced this much in a long time.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Why not?
F	MAGGIE	I don't know, you get busy, kids, school, there's so much going on.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Well you gotta make time for the stuff you love or you'll forget who you are. Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye-
F	MAGGIE	You know, my husband's name is Rick. Rick smiles at this.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Well that makes me the perfect guy to have an affair with--you'd never have to worry about screaming out the wrong name during sex. Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	I'm kidding.
F	MAGGIE	I know.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Now come on, let's go find Grace and get something to eat. I'm starving. As they head back to the party, we
M	FLATS	Hey, Rick. Oh...hey, Flats. How you doing, man?
M	FLATS	Great. What's up with you? How's that hall pass thing going? Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed.
M	RICK	Who told you about that--was it Hog- head?
M	FLATS	No. Some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office. Rick REACTS to this. So what's the deal--you getting laid? What? No. I don't know where you're getting your information, Flats, but a hall pass isn't just about getting laid, it's about getting a week off from marriage to do as you please-- whether that be fishing, or watching TV, whatever it is that relaxes you. Oh, I didn't know that. Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes)
M	RICK	Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late for my work-out appointment. When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Hey, girl! All right! You decided to go for it. As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLS
M	FLATS	Hey, Rick! Good luck with the fishing! As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the
F	LEIGH	Clyde, this is my friend, uh...
M	RICK	Rick.
F	LEIGH	He's looking to join.
M	CLYDE	Great. I'll get you signed up. Leigh pats Rick's hand.
F	LEIGH	See ya. She turns to leave.
M	RICK	So, uh, are you gonna grab a brewski after your work-out?
F	LEIGH	Nah. Rick looks disappointed.
M	LEIGH (CONT'D)	I'm gonna grab two. Leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away, she gives
M	RICK	Peace it! As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes. CLOSE ON RICK'S FACE - he's wearing the headphones and has PULL BACK to reveal that he's SITTING ON THE TOILET. RICK'S POV - as the Metrosexual talks to ANOTHER NAKED MAN,
M	RICK	What's that about--you swimming the English Channel? The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.
M	METROSEXUAL	Nah, Just not into looking like the knuckle-dragging guy on the evolution-of-man chart. Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered
M	RICK	Oh...yes. He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then Rick is in a DEEP SLEEP. His mouth is wide open but his head Little help... When none comes, a life-and-death STRUGGLE ensues as the
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Help ...me... Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked
M	NAKED METROSEXUAL #1	Are you having chest pains, sir? No, no, I think I was...in the hot tub too long. I can't feel my body.
M	NAKED METROSEXUAL #2	How long were you in there?
M	RICK	What time is it?
M	NAKED METROSEXUAL #2	Seven-thirty.
M	RICK	About three hours. That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE
M	NAKED METROSEXUAL #1	Try not to move, sir.
M	RICK	I'm okay, just help me up. All right, give him a hand. Metrosexual #2 straddles Rick's chest and leans down to pull ANGLE ON - two TANNED, HAIRLESS METROSEXUAL ASSES flanking
M	RICK	Okay, thanks, guys. I can take it from here. The metrosexuals release Rick and he gets about two steps Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:
M	FRED	We let down the male species. I really thought our hall passes might change the philosophy of marriage in America. Fred eats a big scoop of ice cream. I envisioned a national holiday, right between July 4th and Labor Day, like the first Friday in August, Hall Pass Day; a day for husbands to get some strange, a day that would forever be known as the holiday,that saved the institution of marriage.
M	RICK	All right, don't give up.
M	FRED	I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts- -this is our last day and we got nothing cooking. Maybe you were right. Maybe we should just tell the girls to come home.
M	RICK	No. I want the hall pass. Fred looks at Rick, surprised.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	At first I wasn't sure, but now I want the dream.
M	FRED	I'm not even sure I know what the dream is anymore.
M	RICK	I just...I just want to know what it's like to be with another woman.
M	FRED	Well, just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank-- it's almost like being there.
M	RICK	I don't have anything in that spank bank.
M	FRED	I'm talking about all the girls before you met Maggie. Rick doesn't say anything. What? No, you're not serious? Rick lowers his head.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Wait a second, are you saying...? But how can that be--you didn't meet Maggie until college? Yeah, so? What do you think, everyone gets laid in high school? I got news for you, mister--getting laid in high school is not a right, it's a privilege. Fred puts down his ice cream. Rick SIGHS.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	First class, first day, freshman year, I saw Maggie--she was sitting three seats away in Western Civ-- and I fell in love instantly. I begged her for three months to go out with me, she finally caved, and that night I told her I loved her.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Eighty-four days later she told me she loved me back and we've been together ever since. Fred stares at him.
M	FRED	Wow. That's a really creepy story. Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Hello. Yeah. Oh, okay, great. Fred hangs up but doesn't say anything.
M	RICK	Who was that?
M	FRED	Just an angel from heaven. Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet. Coakley's back in town! As Rick's face fills with renewed hope, we...
F	MAGGIE	Does this mean you're going steady? That's not funny. I feel terrible-- the poor kid's spending all his hard-earned money on me--that's sad. Cute, but sad.
F	MAGGIE	Grace, you should be flattered. You're thirty-eight-years-old and college kids are still swooning over you.
F	GRACE	Well I just feel bad if I gave him the wrong impression.
F	MAGGIE	The wrong impression? What makes you think that--I mean, besides the flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love letter? Maggie picks up a card. 'Dearest Grace--Our final game is tonight. Please meet me at the coach's place afterwards to celebrate. Yours truly, Gerry.'
F	GRACE	Thanks for piling on. Grace stands up and SIGHS.
M	GRACE (CONT'D)	Well...I can't accept this. I guess I'm just gonna have to go set him straight.
M	RICK	What are you doing?
M	FRED	Just texting Missy Frankenfield that we're going to be at Enter the Dragon--I'm covering all my bases.
M	RICK	You don't need Missy Frankenfield tonight. If we can't get the job done with Coakley as our wingman, then we're pathetic. Just then, Fred NOTICES something O.S.
M	FRED	All right, here come da man! CLOSE ON RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - a suave, DEBONAIR MAN (played Rick and Fred jump up and approach him WITH OPEN ARMS but at
M	FRED & RICK	Coakley!
M	COAKLEY	My two favorite nutsuckers--how the hell are ya?! The three men hug, then Coakley nods toward Clooney. See who just walke ( in here in front of me?
M	RICK	No, who?
M	COAKLEY	George Clooney.
M	FRED	What's he doing here?
M	COAKLEY	I don't know--must be shooting a movie or something.
M	FRED	Huh. Look, man, we've got a situation on our hands.
M	COAKLEY	Yeah, yeah, Baker filled me in. S'been rough sledding, huh? Coakley puts his arms around the two guys.
M	COAKLEY (CONT'D)	Well, don't worry, my little snickerdicks...Coakley's here. REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Rick, Fred and Coakley watching from
M	COAKLEY	I'm gonna need three-hundred bucks.
M	FRED	For what? Coakley shoots him a look.
M	COAKLEY	If you're really serious about this, stop questioning me. The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE
M	SLICK BOUNCER	Good evening, Mr. Coakley.
M	COAKLEY	What up, my guy? Coakley PASSES ON THE MONEY with a handshake and the Bouncer
M	COAKLEY (CONT'D)	Push the defrost button on the microwave, boys. The deep freeze is over.
M	COAKLEY	Okay, guys, you tried it your way and you railed miserably. You struck out, you were oh-for- everything. So now we do it my way, which is... The guys look at Coakley like Richard Gere looks at the Dalai
M	COAKLEY (CONT'D)	. Go ugly early. Rick and Fred are visibly deflated. Guys, you're not trying to get married here--you're trying to get laid.
M	RICK	Aren't you the guy who goes to the Hawaiian Tropic finals every year? Is that for the ugly girls?
M	COAKLEY	I go to the Tropic finals because Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and she's gonna need a hug. And quite often you can parlay a hug into a hand-job. Rick, you're up--get us two bottles of Moet and six glasses. Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum Hi, Mr. Mills. Rick turns to see that he's crammed in beside his babysitter
M	RICK	Oh, hey, Paige. What are you doing here? She pulls out her license and holds it up.
F	PAIGE	I turned twenty-one yesterday. I'm legal now.
M	RICK	Oh. Well, happy birthday. You out celebrating?
F	PAIGE	Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg. Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead,
M	PAIGE (CONT'D)	She's the best. Forty-two years old but she still parties like she's my age.
M	RICK	Nice. Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.
F	PAIGE	So, Rick, how's the hall pass going? Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little.
M	PAIGE (CONT'D)	You don't mind if I call you Rick, do you? I am officially an adult now.
M	RICK	No, of course not--what did you just say?
F	PAIGE	I was asking about your hall pass. I baby-sit for the Putneys and I heard Gary talking about it the other night at their barbecue. Rick REACTS to this.
M	RICK	He was talking about it at a barbecue?!
F	PAIGE	Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad way. In fact, I thought it was very classy of you to be staying at the Holiday Inn Express instead of bringing girls back to your home with all the kids' pictures and schoolwork taped up everywhere. Rick forces a smile.
M	RICK	Thank you. A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and six glasses please. Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink.
F	PAIGE	So does it work both ways?
M	RICK	What?
F	PAIGE	The hall pass. Does your wife get one, too. Uh, no, no. A hall pass is for men only.
F	PAIGE	Oh. Who made that rule?
M	RICK	Well ...um... As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter.
F	PAIGE	By the way, I kind of owe you an apology.
M	BASH	Last week ful) when you drove me home, I shouldn't have snapped at you like that.
M	RICK	Oh, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding.
F	PAIGE	No, it wasn't. She takes a moment, looks around.
M	PAIGE (CONT'D)	If you thought I was coming on to you that night, it's because...I was. Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with
M	RICK	Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but it was great seeing you. Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly
F	PAIGE	Are you serious? You're doing this again... even with a hall pass?
M	RICK	Paige, you're my kids' babysitter. Have a happy birthday. As Rick walks away, we go BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne.
M	COAKLEY	Here we go, bubbles doth floweth.
M	FRED	Holy crap... look who's here. The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past
F	LEIGH	Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday-- I thought we were gonna grab a beer? Fred looks at Rick, confused. Yeah, I got a little caught up in my curls and reps and shit. So is this your playground?
F	LEIGH	Nah, I've never been here, but a friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so I promised him I'd come. Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives
M	WANNABE	Wassup, girl? Wannabe NOTICES Rick and loses his smile. Oh. Hey. What are you doing here-- you auditing the place?
M	RICK	Actually, I work for Sirius XM Radio--we're looking to hire some new deejays so I'm checking out all the clubs. Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful.
M	WANNABE	Oh. Cool. Are you serious?
M	RICK	Not! Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the Oh, that's hip. Real fresh. Why don't you hit the dance floor-- the next song's gonna be for you. As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe Beer? When were you two going to have a beer? No, no, no, Leigh and I just belong to the same gym and happened to be there at the same time yesterday afternoon.
M	FRED	What gym do you belong to and where the hell was I?
M	COAKLEY	Well, according to Kimmy Long, you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub-and-tug without filling out the paperwork. This takes the wind out of Fred's sails.
M	RICK	What? Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred.
M	RICK (CONT'D)	I thought the massage parlor was admitting defeat?
M	FRED	I had a knot in my neck--why the hell didn't you tell me you saw Coffee Girl?!
M	COAKLEY	Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all here for the same thing. And I'll give you a hint what that thing is: It begins with a 'P' and ends with an 'ussy.' Coakley puts his arm around Fred.
M	COAKLEY (CONT'D)	Now relax, Fredd , everyone's gonna get taken care ot. We Just gotta find you a gazelle with a bad wheel.
M	FRED	Huh? Coakley spots something.
M	COAKLEY	Ooh--there's a couple of trainwrecks. Let's go. Whoa--wait a second. But Coakley steers Fred over to two CHUBBY, NOT-SO-ATTRACTIVE
M	COAKLEY	Ladies, this is my friend Fred Pinkberry--his yogurt company just went public and he's out celebrating. He'd like to offer you a flute of champagne. The Chubby Blondes PERK UP.
M	CHUBBY BLONDE #1	I love Pinkberry! As the girls make room for a reluctant Fred, we go...
M	RICK	So.. .having a good time?
F	LEIGH	Chillin'.
M	RICK	Me too. Just chillin' and wigglin'. LONG BEAT as they dance. Then:
M	RICK (CONT'D)	I haven't been ancing in a long time. I can tell.
M	RICK	Oh yeah? Just try to keep up. She smiles at this, then Coakley DANCES UP BESIDE RICK and
M	COAKLEY	Abort! Abort! You stand not a chance.
M	RICK	No, no, I think we're starting to gel. Coakley rolls his eyes.
M	COAKLEY	No, no, you're mistaken. Look, dude, this ain't Operation Cock- block here--now trust me, retreat. Rick glances back at Leigh, torn. She looks fantastic.
M	RICK	Coak, I'm never gonna have another hall pass, so this memory has to last a lifetime. . .you know what I mean? Coakley looks at Leigh and SIGHS.
M	COAKLEY	All right, I'll be at the bar when this thing blows up in your face. As Rick dances back over to Leigh, we... All right, 'all, adult-swim's over. Now if you was born before 1980 you're gonna want to step off the floor 'cause we're about to kick it up. ON RICK - he looks over at Wannabe but CONTINUES TO DANCE.
M	RICK	Is this guy your boyfriend or something?
F	LEIGH	No, no, no. She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily.
M	LEIGH (CONT'D)	One time we messed around a little.
M	RICK	And what does 'messed around a little' mean these days?
F	LEIGH	Anal. Rick tries hard to act nonchalant.
M	LEIGH (CONT'D)	I'm kidding. He kissed me one night and I kissed back--I shouldn't have. Seriously, you grandpappies better get off the floor before someone falls and breaks a hip! Rick points at Wannabe. Just play your funky music, white boy! As the music shifts gears and becomes FASTER and LOUDER, we
M	HISPANIC WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)	Hola, Maggie, this is Isabel. I went to clean the house today but nobody has been there or slept in any of the beds this week, so I just cleaned the windows and left early. I hope you don't mind. CLOSE ON a concerned-looking Maggie. She moves to the
M	RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)	Hey. Maggie turns to see Rick Coleman standing out on her front
F	MAGGIE	Oh. Hey. She goes to the screen door.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Thought you might want to help me celebrate the end of the season. He holds up a grocery bag.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	I got some good late-night eats. Maggie hesitates a moment. Then she opens the door and lets
M	CHUBBY BLONDE #1	It was the greys--you know, the tall, skinny aliens--and they were all over my yard, but--and here's the weird thing--I wasn't at all afraid of them so when they asked me if I wanted to get in their spaceship, I said, 'Sure,' and I walked right on.
M	CHUBBY BLONDE #2	Oh my God, you're so brave! I would never, ever in a million years climb into one of those things. Fred, would you ever just walk into a UFO on your own? If they came right now I would, sure.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD (O.S.)	There you are! Fred looks up to see Missy Frankenfield approaching.
M	FRED	Oh my god! You're here! Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug. Franken-berry, how the heck are ya?! She returns the embrace, but not quite as tight.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	You look incredible! Thanks, Fred, you look good, too.
M	FRED	Never felt better. Missy nods.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	I have to say, I can't believe I'm actually here--I was on my way home from dinner when I noticed your text. So what's this big emergency?
M	FRED	Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I just meant that there's some important stuff I want to talk to you about. You know, one on one, me and you--without all the husbands and wives and hoopla. So how are you?
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	I'm... good.
M	FRED	No, I mean how-are-you. Inside. What's happenin' in there? There must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and everything. She gives him a long look.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	Maybe we should go somewhere else-- this doesn't seem like the best place to spill one's guts. Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside. What part of 'go ugly early' didn't you understand? You've got a better chance of winning husband-of-the- year than tagging that chiquita. Fred flinches at this.
M	FRED	But...I know her. She said she wants to leave with me.
M	COAKLEY	Then she's insane--run for the hills.
M	FRED	Coak, the woman's going through a divorce. She's not insane, she's just making really poor decisions right now. Here, give Rick the keys to my mini- van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel with Missy. Coakley looks back at Missy and softens.
M	COAKLEY	It's your funeral, princess. BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF
F	LEIGH	Are you okay--you keep checking your pulse?
M	RICK	Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest cramp during the last song, but I worked through it. She smiles at this.
F	LEIGH	Come on, let's sit this one out. I need a breather. They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a
M	LEIGH (CONT'D)	So what's up with the ring? He looks at his finger, then back at her.
M	RICK	Um...have you ever heard of a hall pass?
M	GERRY	There she is! Come on in, I'm mixing up some margaronis. We lost our final game, but I got four hits!
F	GRACE	Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?
M	GERRY	They all went out to party--now get in here! But Grace stays on the porch.
F	GRACE	Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay.
M	GERRY	What? Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it
M	GERRY (CONT'D)	Is everything okay?
F	GRACE	Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, but... .I can't accept this.
M	GERRY	Why not? Grace does a double-take.
F	GRACE	Gerry, I'm a married woman. Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the
M	GERRY	Um... I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, Grace. It's just that...I really like you.
F	GRACE	I like you, too, Gerry, and you didn't make me uncomfortable. She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's
F	LEIGH	So...you're married?
M	RICK	I wasn't deliberately hiding it. He holds up his ring hand.
F	LEIGH	Yeah, I just thought your wife had died or something and you were wearing it out of respect. Uh, nope. She's still hangin' in there. Just then, Coakley PULLS RICK ASIDE.
M	COAKLEY	Come on, you're not gonna close the sale here--let's move this clambake back to my place.
M	RICK	Okay, but what am I gonna do there?
M	COAKLEY	What do you mean, what are you gonna do? I've got a house with bedrooms--do the math. When it doesn't work out with her--which it won't--there's going to be a bunch of other back-up chicks there. Rick nods then turns to Leigh.
M	RICK	My buddy's inviting everybody back to his crib.
F	LEIGH	Sounds cool. As they walk toward the exit, we
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	I've got to be honest, Fred... I'm not really sure what we're doing here.
M	FRED	What do you mean? We're hangin', we're connecting--that's what friends do. Especially if they want to take it to the next level where they can call each other 'good friends.' He comes to his room and starts to unlock the door.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	You're married, Fred.
M	FRED	Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Fred opens the door but Missy stays in the hall.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	What does blah-blah mean? You are still married, right?
M	FRED	Happily. Look, I don't want to get into all the details, but my wife gave me this one-time deal where I get to be with another woman. He opens the door wide. She looks at him for a BEAT.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	I thought we were going to the hotel bar?
M	FRED	We are. There's a mini-bar in my room. You better hurry up, it's last call. Fred smiles.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	Are you out of your flippin' mind? Fred loses the smile.
M	FRED	Um...
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	Are you out of your mind?!
M	FRED	I'm going to be honest with you-- your tone right now is scaring me.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	You call me up for the first time in your life, claim you have some kind of emergency, and it turns out that you just want to screw me?!
M	FRED	Or not.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	Well, screw you, Fred! She starts walking down the hallway. Fred nods, unfazed.
M	FRED	Nail on the head! She turns and glares at him.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	What?
M	FRED	What you just said--I had that coming. Big time. Fred hangs his head. Seriously, Missy, I...I don't know what's gotten into me this week. I think I must be having some kind of mid-life crisis or something because I've been acting like a real jackass. Anyway ease forgive me. I really am very, very sorry and ashamed. Missy, standing a few feet away, finally calms down.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	Okay. Whatever.
M	FRED	Thank you.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	So ... . you want to come in for that drink? He arches an eyebrow.
M	MISSY FRANKENFIELD	Fuck you, Fred! Missy STORMS away. 'No thank you' would have sufficed. Fred walks into his room and closes the door.
M	FRED	Hi. May I help you? REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Paige's Aunt Meg. She's wearing a
M	AUNT MEG	Rick, my name's Meg. I'm your babysitter Paige's aunt, and I just wanted to come over here and tell you this: They don't make men like you anymore. She smiles.
M	FRED	Oh. Well, thank you. Would you like to come in?
M	GERRY	Everything okay?
F	GRACE	Yeah. Yeah. It's just ...no, everything's not okay.
M	GERRY	What? He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable.
F	GRACE	Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry, and you're very charming and very sweet and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings, but...well, what,just happened can never happen again. Gerry looks confused.
M	GERRY	Oh.
F	GRACE	I know it's probably hard for you to understand but...I love my husband.
M	GERRY	So? What does that have to do with anything? Fate threw us together and we went with it--isn't that what life's all about? Grace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of
F	GRACE	Not always. It wasn't fair to my husband... and it wasn't fair to you because this could never become anything more than just.. .what it was. She looks at him and shrugs apologetically. Gerry BARKS out
M	GERRY	I know that.
F	GRACE	You do? Of course I do. Jeez. I mean, no offense, but let's face it, you're a lot older than me. She flinches, a little embarrassed. A quick reality check
F	GRACE	Right.
M	GERRY	I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just saying, I didn't think we were going to start dating, you know? Could you imagine the looks we'd get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends--except in reverse. Gerry CHUCKLES.
M	GERRY (CONT'D)	You'd be Hugh Hefner.
F	GRACE	Yeah, I got that part. Gerry looks at his watch.
M	GERRY	Ooh, I gotta get going. We have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes. Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M.
M	GERRY CONT'D	It's, uh, kind o a tradition that we always get together on the night of the last game. It would probably be uncool if I missed it.
F	GRACE	You don't have to explain.
M	GERRY	Seriously, though, thanks for everything--that was awesome. He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then
F	LEIGH	I guess I still have a lot to get out of my system before I do the marriage trip. I'm one of those people who wants to try everything once before I die. Have you ever been with a married guy? Leigh pauses, but she doesn't flinch.
F	LEIGH	No.
M	RICK	Neither have I. Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of I'd like to help you take being with a married guy off your list of things to do before you die.
F	LEIGH	You would?
M	RICK	Yes. Leigh gets close.
F	LEIGH	I don't want to be a home-wrecker.
M	RICK	I've got a one-time pass, remember?
F	LEIGH	That wasn't just a line?
M	RICK	No. It's for real. Leigh seems intrigued. She moves closer still, takes his
F	LEIGH	So where can we go to talk some more about this? Um, Coakley has a game room upstairs. We could.. .talk there. Leigh! Rick and Leigh look over to see an AGITATED Wannabe forcing Where have you...? Why didn't you...? You knew this was my big night! How could you just--? Look, can I please talk to you in private? Now. Leigh looks apologetically at Rick.
F	LEIGH	Can you give me a second?
M	RICK	Sure. Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches them
M	WANNABE	Well? Are you coming? Leigh SIGHS, then approaches Rick.
F	LEIGH	I'm sorry, Rick. I have to go deal with this. Rick can't believe what's happening.
M	RICK	Really? Now? I thought you said he wasn't your boyfriend.
F	LEIGH	He's not...but he is a friend. Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there at
M	LEIGH (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. Before Rick can stop her, Leigh LEAVES THE PARTY with
F	MAGGIE	.And he hasn't even spent one night in his own bed this week.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Let me get this straight--you gave him his freedom and now you're mad that he's acting free? This logic clearly stings Maggie.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	Hey, I'm sure there's an explanation. Maybe he took a trip somewhere?
F	MAGGIE	I called his assistant--he's been in the office almost everyday.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Look, Maggie, for all you know your husband's been working at a sou kitchen, sleeping in his car al week, and he's only gotten laid two or three times at most. She looks up and forces a smile.
F	MAGGIE	Ha-ha. Maggie checks her watch.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Jeez, I wonder what's taking Grace so long?
M	RICK COLEMAN	Well, if she went over to break the kid's heart, the least she could do is lend a sympathetic ear. He flips a pancake onto a plate.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	Prepare yourself for heaven. She reaches for the plate, but he slaps her hand away.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	Not so fast, lady. I'm not finished. You have not lived until you've had my steaming hot blueberry pancakes... He pulls a carton of vanilla ice cream out of a bag.
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	.A la mode. Maggie smiles.
F	MAGGIE	Oh My-lanta.
M	RICK COLEMAN	And to wash it all down... Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a DESSERT WINE. Off
M	RICK	Hey. . .what are you guys doing here?
M	HOG-HEAD	We're here for the hall pass.
M	RICK	Really? I thought you guys had given up on us?
M	BAKER	We did. We're here with them. He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's
M	RICK	What are you talking about?
M	BAKER	When Leary and Boshane heard about your guy's hall pass, they convinced their wives to give them one, too. A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none
M	RICK	You weren't supposed to tell anyone about the hall pass!
M	LEARY	They didn't say anything. Our wives heard about it at the pool.
M	RICK	No! At the pool?! Rick rubs his face, distressed.
M	BOSHANE	Yep. And then about three days ago-- after some hard-core negotiating-- we managed to push the bill through. The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.
M	RICK	Really? So...how's it going?
M	BOSHANE	Solid. Very solid.
M	LEARY	We're building mucho momentumo. Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION. Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just about sex, you know.
M	BOSHANE	That's right. It's about going bowling and, uh, staying up late, and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it.
M	RICK	Haven't gotten laid yet, huh? It's a lot tougher than we thought it would be. Just then Gary comes around a corner.
F	GARY	Hey, dudes, there's like ten very bangable chicks out on the back deck--let's go! Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER.
M	LEARY	To freedom! The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.
F	LEIGH	Hey, where are you going?
M	RICK	What are you doing...? I thought you'd left.
F	LEIGH	No. I told you, I just had to talk him off the ledge. I calmed him down and sent him on his way.
M	RICK	Oh. Uh, great.
F	LEIGH	So where's that game room? I thought we were gonna play some games. She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go... THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a
F	LEIGH	I'll be right back--I just have to use the bathroom. Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears
M	COAKLEY (O.S.)	Hey. REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small
M	RICK	Hey. How come you're not downstairs partying? Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.
M	COAKLEY	All partied out, pal. Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the
M	COAKLEY (CONT'D)	Man, that Barney Fife still kills me. He looks back to Rick. Hey, I was thinking about this hall- pass business. It's really ironic, isn't it? Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.
M	RICK	How's that?
M	COAKLEY	Well think about it. There's two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives: The guy who does it behind her back, and a guy like you who has his wife's permission.
M	RICK	Well it's not really cheating if I have permission.
M	COAKLEY	Yeah, whatever. The point is, if you asked a hundred people who the better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em would pick you, because you're being honest--there's no deceit involved. Rick is growing uncomfortable.
M	COAKLEY (CONT'D)	But the funny thing is, the other guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he has to live with all that guilt and anxiety, while his wife's running around happy as a clam because she doesn't know anything. And you, the good guy, you've got no guilt at all because you just laid it all on your wife's shoulders.
M	RICK	Well I didn't really think of it
M	COAKLEY	It's like she's your guilt Sherpa! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.
M	COAKLEY (CONT'D)	Funny, huh? Yeah.
M	COAKLEY	And that, my friend, is why you are a genius. As Rick lets this all sink in, we
M	FRED	Cheers. They CLINK glasses.
M	AUNT MEG	Rick, I hope you don't mind me tracking you down--Paige told me where you were staying.
M	FRED	Please. Not at all.
M	AUNT MEG	You've been very sweet to her. Fred waves her off.
M	FRED	Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I can for the kids. Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.
M	AUNT MEG	She told me everything. And I have to say, I was very impressed.
M	FRED	Hm?
M	AUNT MEG	I know she tried to hook-up with you--twice in fact--and that you set her straight both times. Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.
M	FRED	Uh...hook-up? Rick, enough with the chivalry. Paige wanted to sleep with you and you didn't take advantage of her. I'm just saying that's very cool. He shrugs modestly.
M	FRED	Well... she's a kid and kids get crushes. I remember in tenth grade I had the biggest crush on my French teacher--thank God Mr. LeClaire was professional enough to only date seniors. Meg GIGGLES.
M	AUNT MEG	I'm serious, it takes a certain kind of guy to say no to a beautiful young girl like that-- especially since you have your wi e's permission now. Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down.
M	AUNT MEG (CONT'D)	I like that, Rick. You have morals. She leans in and KISSES HIS NECK. Fred glances down at her
M	FRED	Hey, all you have in this world is your word. As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, we
M	RICK	Leigh, I gotta split.
F	LEIGH	What? Yeah, I kind of hit a wall. She can hardly believe her ears.
F	LEIGH	Really? Are you feeling okay? You're not mad because I went outside with my friend, are you?
M	RICK	No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be doing this. I have.. .you know, commitments. Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her Um, you dropped something. For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's heart
F	LEIGH	Relax. Don't think so much. You're gonna have your wife for the rest of your life, but tonight. . .you have me. Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK,
M	RICK	Nope. I can't do this. He reaches for his shirt.
F	LEIGH	What are you doing?
M	RICK	I'm sorry. She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants.
F	LEIGH	Your wife didn't give you a hallway permission slip, did she?
M	RICK	Yes, she did, but... look, you're insanely beautiful and pathologically sexy and every cell in my body is telling me to dust do this, but-- Rick points to his chest. See this area, this spot right here? The first time Maggie and I slept together, back in college, she fell asleep right here. And she left a puddle of drool. And it didn't bother me. It actually felt good. That's when I knew I was going to marry her. And when my kids--Emma and Gunnar-- when they were babies, this is where they slept. Or sometimes at four o'clock in the morning Emma would just lay there and stare up at me. It was where we first got to know each other. So I'm sorry, Leigh, but as amazing as I think you are...I gotta go home. Rick shrugs apologetically.
F	LEIGH	Well, I think you have a screw loose and you're probably going to regret this for the rest of your life, but. . .right on, man.
M	RICK	Um...do you want me to give you a ride home?
F	LEIGH	No. It's only one-thirty--I'm going back down to the party. Rick raises two fingers.
M	RICK	Peace it.
F	LEIGH	R-O-C-K in the U-S-A. As they smile at each other one last time, we
M	RICK	Hello. Yes, is this Fred Searing?
M	RICK	Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry, he's not here right now. I'm using his car. Well, would you know where I could find him? This is Sgt. Polisner of the Massachusetts State Police. As Rick grows alarmed, we
M	AUNT MEG	I'm attracted to men with integrity.
M	FRED	Thanks--wow, you got great jugs. Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed (with his
M	AUNT MEG	Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh? Well, I grew up in the midwest. She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his
M	AUNT MEG	Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you to make love to me. Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and
M	RICK	Fred, I need to talk to you! Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused.
M	AUNT MEG	Fred? I thought you were Rick?!
M	RICK	I'm Rick. Fred cowers guiltily.
M	FRED	Please don't judge me. As Aunt Meg KARATE KICKS Fred in the face, we
M	FRED	What did they tell you? Is Grace gonna be okay?
M	RICK	All I know is she was in a car accident and they rushed her to the hospital.
M	FRED	Oh my God... Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and
M	REACT.	THEIR POV - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can
M	FRED (CONT'D)	Whoa!!! What the hell...?! Wannabe turns to them, a CRAZED LOOK on his face.
M	WANNABE	How do you like me now, Splenda- boy?
M	FRED	You moron, that's Lny car! His is the one next to it! Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR
M	RICK	Nice job, Fred.
M	FRED	Oh come on! How can a hospital not have a live operator?!
M	RICK	It's four in the morning, Fred. Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel.
M	FRED	What was I thinking?! I had a great wife--a beautiful wife--and now I may lose her.. .because of you.
M	RICK	What are you talking about?! You said our wives were living their dreams, with their fancy gas ovens, and that our dream was the hall pass! How can you blame this on me?!
M	FRED	I'd never even heard of a hall pass until you flaunted yours in my face! 'Hey, look at me, I've got a hall pass--everyone should have a hall pass!' You ruined my life, Mills!
M	RICK COLEMAN	This is a great place.
F	MAGGIE	Yeah, my family's had it since I was a kid. We used to come for a week a summer, then two weeks, then a month, then by the time I got to high school we were living here all summer long.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Something's wrong here, Maggie.
F	MAGGIE	Hm?
M	RICK COLEMAN	Something's wrong with a guy who would leave a woman like you alone for this long. Well, you know...I did give him a hall pass.
M	RICK COLEMAN	So what? If you were my girl, I wouldn't have taken it. An awkward moment. Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks
M	RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)	You deserve way better.
F	MAGGIE	Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't really even want the hall pass. I kind of forced it on him.
M	RICK COLEMAN	Why would you do that? Maggie thinks about this.
F	MAGGIE	I don't know. I guess I felt like he wasn't noticing me anymore. j guess I wanted to feel.. .desired again. And the truth is, in my heart, I never thought he'd go through with it. He brushes her hair from her face and they look into each
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	Oh my God...
M	RICK COLEMAN	What?
F	MAGGIE	This hall pass ...it wasn't for him. It was...for me. And as they hang on that realization, we
M	COP #1	Did you see that? He didn't have a windshield. Cop #2 throws the car into drive and they pull a U-ey and
M	FRED	I'm sorry, man, I shouldn't have blamed you for this. I'm the one who dragged you into this thing.
M	RICK	No, you didn't. I went willingly.
M	FRED	I've been bad, Rick. I've been real bad.
M	RICK	We've both been bad.
M	FRED	I've been worse. I kissed your babysitter's aunt.
M	RICK	That's not so bad.
M	FRED	On the vagina.
M	RICK	Ooh. They hear a SIREN and Rick looks back to see the cops on Oh shit.
M	RICK	Pull over, man!
M	FRED	No way, I can out-run 'em!
M	RICK	No you can't--not in this thing!
M	RICK	Oh God, now there's two of 'em!
M	FRED	I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there!
M	RICK	Are you crazy?!
M	FRED	Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife!
M	COP #2	We're on! The officers spring from their cars and quickly TACKLE Fred
M	RICK	Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain everything! A BURLY OFFICER from the back-up car form-tackles Rick, Grace needs me! Cop #1 PINS FRED'S HEAD TO THE FLOOR as Cop #2 lays across
M	COP #1	Okay, just take it easy, buddy.
M	FRED	No, I won't take it easy! Look, I'm sorry I was speeding and I shouldn't have run from you guys, but my wife's been in an accident and she's in this emergency room and I gotta see how she is because... The cops look moved and unsure what to do.
F	DOCTOR	Are you the husband of... .Grace Searing? Fred strains to look up.
M	FRED	Yes! Is she okay?! The Doctor hesitates and the cops look at each other and then
M	BURLY OFFICER	All right, let him up. The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes
M	FRED	Please tell me she's gonna be okay.
F	DOCTOR	She is. Your wife broke her nose and she got shaken up a bit, but all in all she's a very lucky woman.
M	FRED	You got that wrong, doc. I'm the lucky one. Fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off. Bless you, doctor! Fred turns to Rick and the two men hug and then Rick grabs
M	RICK	You take care of that woman, buddy, and I'm gonna go home and take care of mine. Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other,
M	FRED	Rick... Rick stops and turns at the door.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	You go love that lady! The Burly Officer rolls his eyes and steps up to Rick.
M	BURLY OFFICER	Uh, before you 'go love that lady', we're going to have to write you guys up. As the officer pulls out his CITATION PAD, we
M	MAGGIE (O.S.)	Oh my god...oh my god...oh my and... ON RICK - he looks concerned as he approaches the bedroom Oh my god... oh my god, you poor thing. Maggie looks up, shocked to see Rick. Hold on, Rick just walked in. Grace was in a car accident!
M	RICK	I know. She's okay. Maggie goes back to the phone. And they let you go? Okay... so you're on your way? Great. I love you, too, honey. She hangs up. My God, she scared ( me to death.
M	RICK	March twenty-fifth, 1988.
F	MAGGIE	What?
M	RICK	The day I lost my virginity. March 25th, 1988 at approximately ten- thirty in the evening. Maggie thinks about this.
F	MAGGIE	What are you talking about? We were dating then. Rick nods. She looks at him, not sure if she understands.
M	RICK	You were my first. And you were my last. And you were everything in between. As it all sinks in, Maggie STARTS TO WELL UP.
F	MAGGIE	Really?
M	RICK	Really.
F	MAGGIE	So...is that why you were crying that first night? Rick shrugs, embarrassed.
M	MAGGIE (CONT'D)	And I was...I was your last?
M	RICK	You are my only. Forever. Maggie smiles and runs into his arms. They KISS, and it's a Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:
M	FRED	.And what were you doing driving around at one o'clock in the morning? Well...I was upset so I went for a drive--you know, to think--and I must have hit a patch of sand, and before I knew it I was into the pole. Fred stops and looks her in the eye.
M	FRED	I'm sorry, Grace.
F	GRACE	For what?
M	FRED	For putting you through all this. Grace looks awash in guilt.

M	FRED	Yes, it is--of course it's my fault. This isn't you--driving around all night, thinking--you're not a thinker. When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't
F	GRACE	Look, Fred, we have to talk about... about what happened this week. Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid
M	FRED	Grace. . .do we really have to do this? Grace lowers her head guiltily.
F	GRACE	Yeah. Yeah, we do. When she looks back up, she NOTICES the SPRAY-PAINTED and
M	GRACE (CONT'D)	Horny old man? Oh, no, honey, that's not me--they were talking about Rick. Grace looks at him, confused. Suddenly Fred falls to his Look, all you gotta know is that whatever happened doesn't matter! I love you and only you! And I'm going to treat you like the queen that you are for the rest of your living days, so help me God! I'll mow the lawn, I'll shovel the snow, I'll wash the stubble off the sink... Grace looks down at him.
M	FRED (CONT'D)	.But please, I'm begging you, sweetie... can we please just never talk about what happened this week? Grace's eyes flicker about, hardly believing her luck.
F	GRACE	Um...deal. Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.
M	GRACE (CONT'D)	I love you, Fred. As they embrace, Fred sees Rick come out the front door with
