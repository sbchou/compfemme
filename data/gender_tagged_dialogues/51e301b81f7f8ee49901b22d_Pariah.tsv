F	ALIKE	Yeah, okay!
F	AUDREY	And tie your head up.
M	AUDREY(CONT'D)	It's your head. And you really should wash your face, too.
F	ALIKE	I don't have on make-up.
F	AUDREY	Wash your face anyway.
F	ALIKE	Mom. I'm seventeen years old, please don't talk to me like--
F	AUDREY	Watch your tone. Well, it's your skin.

M	MRS. ALVARADO (O.S.)	Hey there!
F	ALIKE	Hey!
F	MRS. ALVARADO	Whaddja bring me?
F	ALIKE	Nothin' you can eat.
F	MRS. ALVARADO	You shouldn't be eatin' that crap, either.
F	ALIKE	I know.
F	MRS. ALVARADO	Sooo, where's the new stuff?
F	MRS. ALVARADO	Hmmm.
F	ALIKE	Did you see the one in the back?
M	ALIKE (CONT'D)	I'll probably do it in class.
F	ALIKE	So?
F	MRS. ALVARADO	So what? What do you think?
F	MRS. ALVARADO	They're okay.
F	ALIKE	Okay?
F	MRS. ALVARADO	They're lovely. Of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all, you know that. But...I don't know. Is it your best? No.
F	ALIKE	I thought it was good.
F	MRS. ALVARADO	It's good. Not great.
F	MRS. ALVARADO	I believe you can go deeper.
F	AUDREY	Oh, so your log is all up to date?
M	CLERK	No I--
F	AUDREY	And you've checked the round for any calls?
M	CLERK	Well I --
F	AUDREY	Do you even know which doctors are on the floor?
M	CLERK	No ma'am I--
F	AUDREY	Then I suggest you get busy.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Hey girl! Mind if I sit here?
F	AUDREY	No, not at all. Help yourself.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Whatchu got there? You been shopping?
F	AUDREY	Oh, no. Just some yogurt. Some vanilla yogurt.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	No I meant in the bag. What do you have in the shopping bag--the big red thing?
F	AUDREY	Oh I'm...I don't know where my mind is...Yeah, this is just uh--well let me get your opinion.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Oh that's nice.
F	AUDREY	Yeah see isn't this cute?
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Umm-hmm. That's for your daughter?
F	AUDREY	Yeah, this is for Alike.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	The youngest one.
F	AUDREY	No she's the oldest one.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Oh, the other one. Okay.
F	AUDREY	What, you think it's too young?
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	No, no. For whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first. But I think it should be fine. It's really cute.
F	AUDREY	Thank you.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	It'll compliment her figure.
F	AUDREY	Now see that's what I thought... But Lee doesn't like anything I pick out for her anymore.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going on 27 mind you, banned me from buying her any more clothes. We have two completely different tastes. I just give her gift cards now and trust me, we're both happier for it. Is it her birthday?
F	AUDREY	No, no. I just wanted to get her something nice. You know.

F	AUDREY	This is your father's night off.
M	AUDREY (CONT'D)	So straighten up.
F	SHARONDA	Homecoming got moved this year. It's gonna be in September instead of October.
F	AUDREY	Oh really?
F	SHARONDA	Yeah. Which means I'll be able to go to Autumn Ball and the Homecoming Dance.
F	AUDREY	Who are you going with?
F	SHARONDA	I don't know. Maybe Derek. If he asks me. Maybe Parrish. I haven't decided yet. But for homecoming, I definitely want to go with Craig.
F	AUDREY	Oooh, I see. Lee, who are you going with?
F	ALIKE	Umm. I'm not going.
F	AUDREY	Not going? This is your junior year. How can you not go?
M	ARTHUR	Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to go.
F	AUDREY	But it's her junior year, she's not gonna have any memories.
M	ARTHUR	I don't like all those boys buzzing around my daughters anyway.
F	SHARONDA	Nobody buzzes around Alike.
M	ARTHUR	That's right and it better stay that way. Matter of fact, I don't know if I'ma let you go.
F	SHARONDA	Daaa-aad?!

F	LAURA	Nah Candy, I can't just dip out on you like that--
F	CANDACE	I was doing just fine before you moved in, remember? I can handle it. You working was only supposed to be temporary. Mom would've wanted--
F	LAURA	Who?! Man, don't even--
F	CANDACE	She would've--
F	LAURA	Stop.
M	LAURA (CONT'D)	I'll get the money orders in the morning.

F	ALIKE	You listening?
F	LAURA	I'm listening--all I'm saying is-- pass me that milkshake mix right there.
F	LAURA	All I'm saying is that I don't think you should put yourself out there like that. Especially if you don't even know if she likes you like that.
F	ALIKE	She does.
F	LAURA	How do you know she does?
F	ALIKE	I just know she does.
F	LAURA	Hmmph. We'll see.
F	ALIKE	What're you doing?
F	LAURA	I thought I felt a drop of pig shit.
F	ALIKE	Shut up.
F	LAURA	All I know is I been trying to get you to holla at girls in the club for the longest.
F	ALIKE	I don't want to holla at girls in the club.
F	LAURA	Obviously. Why you pressed about this chick?
F	ALIKE	I wanted to ask you about something else too.
F	LAURA	Oh God, what now?
F	ALIKE	I need you to get something for me.
F	LAURA	What?!
F	LAURA	What?!
F	ALIKE	Just for my image.
F	LAURA	WHAAAAAT???!! You trying to strap!!?? Whaaatt?!! Oh my God, what are you going through...
F	ALIKE	Please.
F	LAURA	What difference you think having a bulge in your pants gon' make?
F	ALIKE	Pleeeeease. By next Friday. Next Friday?! Okay-- Whatever. Oh my God I can't believe you ! Alright. Yeah. She better be cute for all of this...
F	LAURA	I think it looks natural.
F	LAURA	I'm serious, I mean it doesn't look that bad.
F	ALIKE	I can't believe you.
F	LAURA	What?!
F	ALIKE	Laura, this doesn't look right. I'ma look stupid.
F	LAURA	Well, first of all-- I don't think its supposed to be on top of your underwear like that.
F	ALIKE	I'm not putting this thing next to my skin, it pinches already. It's supposed to fit like that.
F	ALIKE	They didn't have any brown?
F	LAURA	I didn't have time for all of that. The brown ones were too big, anyway.
F	ALIKE	Ugh! You gotta take it back.
F	LAURA	I can't take it back.
F	ALIKE	Here's the receipt!
F	LAURA	Unh-unh. I'm not going back in there. One time was embarrassing enough.
F	ALIKE	You grown!
F	LAURA	Still what if somebody would see me in there? I'm not going back, that's it.

F	SHARONDA	It looks nasty.
F	ALIKE	See, I told you so.
F	SHARONDA	Where's my make up case? I know you got it.

M	ALIKE SHARONDA	She took my makeup again.
F	AUDREY	Lee... Oh. Hello Laura, I didn't see you standing there.
F	LAURA	Hi Mrs. Freeman.
F	AUDREY	How's your mother?
F	LAURA	I haven't spoken to her in awhile. She's fine.
F	AUDREY	Well I hope so. And I'm so glad to hear your sisters finally getting back on her feet. Wasn't she--
F	LAURA	She's good.
F	ALIKE	Mom?!
F	AUDREY	I think we'll just leave this open. Let some air circulate in here.
F	LAURA	I was just about to leave, anyway. So...
F	LAURA	Just try it.
F	LAURA	Will you chill? You just gotta get used to it.
F	ALIKE	Owwww!
F	LAURA	Sit still, people gon' think you got something.
F	ALIKE	This joint hurts, man. I'ma go take it off.
F	LAURA	You not gon' take it off.
F	ALIKE	I'm gonna take it off.
F	LAURA	Where you gonna take it off at?
F	ALIKE	In the bathroom.
F	LAURA	Then where you gon' put it? You gonna walk around the club with a dick in your hand? Chill. I knew we shouldn't have done this. You blowin' me right now.
F	ALIKE	Then I'm out.
F	LAURA	Nah, you're `bout to stay and go through this. You're the one who wanted to meet her, not me.
F	ALIKE	Then you come on, too. Hurry up--
F	MIKA	You alright? Yeah, no, yeah it's just--there's a spring in the cushion or something.
F	MIKA	You wanna switch seats?
F	ALIKE	No, I'm good.
F	MIKA	And you don't wanna dance?
F	LAURA	Hey ya'll we're about to go dance!
F	ALIKE	No, no not really. I'm not really feeling the music.
F	MIKA	Well you don't mind right? I mean you don't mind if I go dance with somebody else?
F	ALIKE	No, do your thing.
F	MIKA	If you change your mind--
F	ALIKE	No, no it's cool.
F	AUDREY	I hope it was worth it.
F	ALIKE	Mom I lost--
F	AUDREY	Save it.
F	ALIKE	It won't happen--
F	AUDREY	Oh I know it won't.
M	AUDREY (O.S.)	Turn that mess off!! Sharonda?! Sharonda are you ready?! Stop lollygagging!
M	SHARONDA (O.S.)	I'm coming!
F	AUDREY	Lee are you ready?! Lee?!
M	AUDREY (CONT'D)	I said off. Thought you were ready?
F	ALIKE	I am ready.
F	AUDREY	You're not going to church looking like that. Where's the blouse I bought you?
F	ALIKE	What's wrong with this?
F	AUDREY	Hey there, you're home early--well actually late. I thought you would have called--
F	ALIKE	Dad--
M	ARTHUR	Do what your mom says.
F	AUDREY	Are you hungry? Let me heat it up for you. I'll heat it up on the stove for you. Tastes better.
F	ALIKE	Dad--
F	AUDREY	Lee!
M	ARTHUR	Leave me out of it.
F	AUDREY	Go get changed.
F	ALIKE	Dad, what's wrong with this outfit?
M	ARTHUR	Nothing.
F	ALIKE	See?
F	AUDREY	I'm not gonna argue with you.
M	ARTHUR	Do what she says.
F	ALIKE	Dad--
M	ARTHUR	Umgowa!
F	AUDREY	And put on a skirt!
F	SHARONDA	Hey Dad!
F	AUDREY	Too much lipstick.
F	SHARONDA	It's lipgloss.
M	SHARONDA (CONT'D)	Okay, okay.
M	ARTHUR	Gimmie kiss.
F	AUDREY	Did you talk to her?
M	ARTHUR	Get me a beer, please. Sharonda's fine.
F	AUDREY	I'm talking about Lee.
M	ARTHUR	Alike. And I don't see that there's a problem.
F	AUDREY	I'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on. And Laura. You said you were going to handle it.
M	ARTHUR	Umm-hmm.
F	AUDREY	She needs a male point of view.
M	ARTHUR	I said okay, dammit! Now can I please have a beer please?
F	AUDREY	It's Sunday morning.
M	ARTHUR	It goes with the spaghetti.
F	AUDREY	Do you have to work tonight?
M	ARTHUR	To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no. To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes.
F	AUDREY	Are you forever gonna be mad?
M	ARTHUR	Are you forever going to be happy? You made that decision a long time ago.
F	AUDREY	We both made sacrifices.
M	ARTHUR	You look beautiful, baby.
F	AUDREY	Tuck your blouse in.
F	ALIKE	This isn't me.
F	AUDREY	Tuck your blouse in.
M	ARTHUR	Leave it out.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	I think it's fine out. What's the deal with you and Laura?
F	ALIKE	What deal?
F	AUDREY	Comin' in late...
F	ALIKE	Dad, I hardly ever--
M	ARTHUR	Why don't you give that a break for a little while?
F	ALIKE	Dad, come on...
F	AUDREY	You heard him! Sharonda! You done?!
M	SHARONDA (O.S.)	Coming!
F	AUDREY	You coming with us?
M	ARTHUR	Nope. Sleep.
F	AUDREY	We could go to a later service. The one o'clock--
M	ARTHUR	I said NO!!
F	SHARONDA	I'm ready.
M	ARTHUR	Alike, you look beautiful. Everybody looks beautiful, okay?
F	AUDREY	Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you to meet.
F	ALIKE	Huh?
M	ALIKE (CONT'D)	Oh. Hey.
F	AUDREY	Get down out the car and come speak. What's wrong with you?
F	ALIKE	Alright, Mom.
F	AUDREY	You'll have to excuse her, she's been feeling rude lately.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Oh don't worry, Audrey, I understand how it is. Hormones. It's just a phase.
F	AUDREY	Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one of my co-workers and her daughter, Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my daughter Alike, we call her "Lee" for short.
F	ALIKE	Hi.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Hello.
F	ALIKE	Nice to meet you.
F	BINA	Hi.
F	AUDREY	And this is my youngest daughter, Sharonda.
F	SHARONDA	Hi.
F	BINA	Hi.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Hi there, nice to meet you.
F	AUDREY	Lee, Bina goes to the same school as you.
F	ALIKE	Cool.
F	BINA	Yeah, I think I've seen you around. Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP English?
F	ALIKE	Yup.
F	AUDREY	So. Now that we're all acquainted, don't be a stranger.
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	Oh no, we won't.
F	AUDREY	Bina I think you and Lee may even go to school the same way. Don't you live off of St. James Place?
F	MRS. SINGLETARY	There is something to be said for safety in numbers.
M	MRS. SINGLETARY (CONT'D)	Well, we need to be pushing off -- I'll call you about those VBS workbooks.
F	AUDREY	Alrighty, I'll be around. Take care.
F	ALIKE	You're funny.
F	AUDREY	I don't know what your problem is.
F	SHARONDA	Can somebody put in this CD please?
F	ALIKE	I don't know what you think is going to change.
F	AUDREY	I know God doesn't make mistakes. I know that much.
M	AUDREY (CONT'D)	You may not like Bina, but you're certainly gonna be spending much less time with that Laura person, I guarantee you that much.
F	SHARONDA	Moooom, can you--
F	AUDREY	Be quiet. Nobody's putting in anything. I'm gonna listen to what I want to listen to for a change.
F	BINA	Look, I don't like lying to my mother, that's all.
F	ALIKE	Then don't, she doesn't have to know.
F	BINA	She does. She asks me everyday.
F	ALIKE	So tell her yeah.
F	BINA	No, I'm sick of lying to cover for you.
F	ALIKE	So don't.
F	BINA	Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you wanna be called. I'm not trying to hang out with you, either, but I'm not about to take an L for it. So stop dodging me, let's just go to school together and be done with it. We don't have to see each other any other time than that.
M	BINA (CONT'D)	Whatever, my mother asks me again, I'm telling her. Then she can tell your mother, then it's whatever for you.
F	ALIKE	Hey! Hey!
M	ALIKE (CONT'D)	Hey look, I'm sorry.
F	BINA	Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna bug out.
F	ALIKE	No for real, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be that way. It's just... OK, I am concerned that my, my mom will find out, but...
F	BINA	But?
F	ALIKE	It's not like that. It's just-- she's just. If you knew her, you'd understand. She's like, I don't know.
M	ALIKE (CONT'D)	So what's your favorite class?
F	BINA	You don't have to make small talk. Let's just walk.
F	ALIKE	I said I'm sorry. It's not you, it's just that my mom is like, she's like...
F	BINA	Overprotective?
F	ALIKE	Yeah.
F	BINA	I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a lot of people's parents are like that.
F	ALIKE	Yeah?
F	BINA	Yeah.
F	ALIKE	Yeah. But probably not like mine. But anyway...
F	BINA	Anyway, like I said, we don't have to talk. Just walk.
M	ALIKE (V.O.)	Hi! This is Lee, I'm not able to answer my phone right now--
F	CANDACE	How's it comin'?
F	LAURA	It's good.
M	ARTHUR	Oh my God!!
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	That's just embarrassing!
F	ALIKE	You ain't got no range, either.
M	ARTHUR	Yeah but at least I hit the backboard. Damn.
F	ALIKE	Brick!!
M	ARTHUR	What's the score?
F	ALIKE	One up.
M	ARTHUR	One?

M	By the membranous chaff of its own	underdeveloped Wings Cramped In the darkness of the too-tight cocoon of its own creation Pauses Thinking death inevitable Prepares to die in the absolute solitude Of Swollen Husk. A c r a c k appears A thin jagged light connecting The inner to the outer world A butterfly, briefly Paralyzed by the imminence of death Discovers life is possible.

F	LAURA	That's alright, man. You can wear some of mine. It's okay, c'mon. Lets get some sleep. My sister'll be home in a little bit, too.
F	AUDREY	Okay.
F	AUDREY	You want to say grace?
M	ARTHUR	Heavenly Father...
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Dear Heavenly Father we pray... we pray thank you for this food and we pray... we pray for your continued blessing...
F	AUDREY	Amen!
M	ARTHUR	Amen.
F	AUDREY	I got this recipe from a magazine. Supposed to be very good. And you see I made those green beans you like. Sharonda pass the rice please.
F	SHARONDA	Dad. You know where she is.
F	ALIKE	Where's Mom?
M	ARTHUR	She...your mother couldn't make it.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	Remember our old place? Waaay out in Queens? It was our first apartment, we were so proud. Had all those trees around it? In October, the whooole block would be covered with leaves. You remember.
M	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	You couldnt've been more than 2 years old. And when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive. You'd get so scared. You'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up. I would try and tell you "they're only leaves, baby" and make you stay on the ground. But you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up. She always picked you up. `Member how we used to--
F	ALIKE	I've been accepted into a early college program. Starts in the Spring. Berkeley.
M	ARTHUR	California's a long way away--
F	ALIKE	Ten weeks writing boot camp, workshops. Then I can start summer semester.
M	ARTHUR	We can talk about that. Okay?
F	ALIKE	I need you to meet with my guidance counselor. Sign the paperwork so I can graduate early.
M	ARTHUR	I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I let her hurt you--
F	ALIKE	I need to know now if you'll sign the papers. Yes or no?
M	ARTHUR	Can you forgive me?
F	ALIKE	Yes or no?
M	ARTHUR	You can always come back home. Things are gonna be different, I promise you--
F	ALIKE	Dad, I'm not running. I'm choosing.
M	ALIKE (CONT'D)	I'm not going back home.
M	ARTHUR	I know. Okay. I better--
F	ALIKE	Tell Mom that she was right.
M	ARTHUR	Right about what?
F	ALIKE	God doesn't make mistakes.
M	ARTHUR	You should tell her yourself.
F	ALIKE	Mom.
F	AUDREY	Lee--Alike. How've you been?
F	ALIKE	Fine. Did Dad tell you?
F	AUDREY	He told me, yes.
F	ALIKE	How are you?
F	AUDREY	I just hope you're keeping yourself safe.
F	ALIKE	I love you, Mom. I said I love you.
F	AUDREY	I'll be praying for you.
M	ALIKE (V.O.)	Heartbreak opens onto the sunrise For even breaking is opening And I am broken I am open Broken to the new light without pushing in Open to the possibilities within pushing out See the love shine in through my cracks See the light shine out through me? I am broken I am open I am Broken Open See the love-light shining through me Shining through my cracks My Spirit takes flight Could not have risen otherwise And I am not Running I am Choosing Running is not a Choice From the Breaking Breaking is freeing Broken is freedom I am not broken I am free.
F	MRS. ALVARADO	Yeah. Yeah.
M	ARTHUR	I got it.
F	ALIKE	Thank you.
M	ARTHUR	You want me to come in with you?
M	ARTHUR	Well--
M	ARTHUR	You can always come back home.
F	ALIKE	I love you.
M	ARTHUR	I love you too.
F	LAURA	Let me get a hug or somethin', damn.
F	SHARONDA	Call us when you get there.
F	ALIKE	You know I will.
F	LAURA	You just better fuckin' call.
M	FADE TO BLACK.
