M	SEBASTIAN	Oh, wait, there's something on your forehead. John brushes it. You got it. Leaf or something. A leaf. On my forehead.

F	JENNY	Are you a complete idiot?!

M	JENNY (O.S.)	MmzmII[lm. That feels so good. rolled up. Jenny takes a swig from a bottle of champagne, passes it to
M	JOHN	How do I get vou?
F	JENNY	What?
M	JOHN	I'm serious. In what world does a guy like me get someone like you?
F	JENNY	Are you kidding? You're part of the plan.
M	JOHN	The plan.
F	JENNY	Step one. Meet an incredibly sweet, smart, sexy guy.
M	JOHN	Done. Step two?
F	JENNY	Marry him.
M	JOHN	Check. Step three? She smiles, puts her face right up to his...
F	JENNY	Now that one's a surprise... They kiss and as we push past them, into the snowy window, we
F	JENNY	You okay?
M	JOHN	Oh yeah.
F	JENNY	You know you got this.
M	JOHN	I know, I got it.
F	JENNY	Who are you?
M	JOHN	I'm John Grogan.
F	JENNY	Wrong. You're John Friggin Grogan who's about to get a job. She leans over and gives him a big, long kiss.
M	JOHN	Um, okay, see now I don't wanna get out of the car.
M	JOHN	i really just wanna sit here and make out with you.
F	JENNY	--Get out of the car. He nods, starts to get out, then pauses.
M	JOHN	Who am i again? Kidding.
M	ARNIE (V.0.)	Sebastian says you won some award? flipping through John's portfolio.
M	JOHN	Yes, sir, I got a Mitchy.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Like a Pulitzer, but for western Michigan.
M	ARNIE	A Mitchy. Min-hmm. So, tell me, why did you want to leave the estimable - - Kalamazoo Gazette?
M	JOHN	Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were in college together, and he was always talking about South Florida... mostly about the women of South Florida, but anyway, after my wife and I got married we thought it might be nice to come
M	ARNIE	For the women?
M	JOHN	Uh, no-- for the... the... uh...
M	ARNIE	For the work?
M	JOHN	Yes. That.
M	ARNIE	Your wife's Jenny Havens, right?
M	JOHN	Well, Jenny Grogan now--
M	ARNIE	She take the job at the Post?
M	ARNIE	I tried to get her over her
M	ARNIE	Damn fine writer.
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	What's the matter, the Post didn't want Yo m?
M	JOHN	Well, she does features. I'm more a straight news writer. This is a better paper for that.
M	ARNIE	Straight news writer, huh. Meaning you think you're a reporter?
M	JOHN	Meaning I know I am.
M	ARNIE	And the six other sweaty-palmed college grads I'm interviewing today, you think you're better than them?
M	JOHN	No, sir. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm not. But I do know that I always seem to surprise myself. Ten years ago, I was doing bong hits and playing Donkey Kong, never dreamed I'd get into college. But I did, and I graduated with honors. Two years ago, my buddies told me that the most Jenny Havens would ever say to me was, You're sweet, but I don't like you in that way.. But she did like me in that way-- and my buddies can suck it because I married her. I certainly never thought I'd win some award with a dumbass name-- The "Mitchy." Exactly sir. But i surprised myself and I won it. And if you give me the chance, I'm pretty sure I'll surprise you, too. Arnie considers him a moment.
M	ARNIE	That's quite a speech, son. You rehearse that, or come up with it on the fly?
M	JOHN	Elevator, on the way up. How'd I do? Arnie just looks back at him.
F	JENNY	So?
M	JOHN	He's got me on a little thing they like to call... Desert Storm-- She gets out of the car and the two embrace right there on okay... "Jobs." Done.
M	JOHN	So what's next? Lunch? House.
M	JOHN	You like the quote about the speed bumps? "If they save even one life--"
M	JOHN	-"it would be worth it. And with that, Janet Dickerson's mother's eyes filled with tears." That one just felt exactly right, y'know?
F	JENNY	Yeah, no, it's good. What happened to the Desert Storm piece?
M	JOHN	That's it. The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait. What, that's not in there?
F	JENNY	Uhhhh... they must've cut it... And they kinda misspelled your name. John Egan...
M	JOHN	What-- you're kidding-- He reaches for the paper, but she holds it away.
F	JENNY	Forget it. It's good, John. It's got facts, some color. It's a solid piece.
M	JOHN	Thanks. I'm almost done with yours. This idea of voting machines sounds
F	JENNY	Well, except on the other page I talk about what could happen-- He goes back to reading. She sips her coffee.
M	JOHN	An awkward moment as he now searches for the new page, has to
F	JENNY	You know what? The rest is just okay, really pretty boring...
M	JOHN	No, no, I'm enjoying it... He tortures himself and keeps reading. She moves to the sink, Wow, they really gave you a lot of space, didn't they? She sets the cup on the counter, looks at the WILTED PLANT on
F	JENNY	Damn. I killed another one. How am I ever going to take care of a kid, I can't even keep a plant alive? John looks up from the paper. "Kid?" She comes gives him a I'll see you later, Mr. Gorgan. She headsout, leaving John staring terrified at the plant.
M	SEBASTIAN (V.0.)	A kid, huh...
M	SEBASTIAN	Well, what'd you expect? You bought a house, man. A house with a mare room...
M	JOHN	What's wrong with a spare room?
M	SEBASTIAN	It's empty, John. That's what's wrong with it. And you know what else is empty? Her womb.
M	JOHN	I'm starting to worry that we're already at Step Six.
M	SEBASTIAN	What?
M	JOHN	You know Jenny, she's got her whole life organized and planned out... Sebastian smiles at a secretary, turns back to John.
M	SEBASTIAN	You want my advice? Get her a PuPPYâ¢
M	JOHN	A puppy.
M	SEBASTIAN	Something other than you she has to take care of. You have a kid, you're a dad. You're not you anymore. You have a dog, you're a master. You're still a guy. With a life.
M	JOHN	And a dog...
M	SEBASTIAN	Whatever, man. You're still free. You've stopped the clock.
M	JOHN	What clock?
M	SEBASTIAN	Okay... you know in movies when there's, like, a bomb and it's ticking down, ten seconds left, and there's some guy with a wire cutter going, "red wire... blue wire... which one do I cut?" And the guy finally just makes a wild-assed guess and SNIP. Silence. The world is saved.
M	JOHN	Okay... is the bomb strapped to a dog... because I'm not sure I'm
M	SEBASTIAN	John, you buy this dog, you're saving your world. Because that ticking you hear, is not a bomb, it's her biological clock. John looks back at him.
M	JOHN	Huh.
M	ARNIE .(O.S.)	Sebastian! They both turn as Arnie sticks his head out of his office.
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	Your travel's approved. Get outta here.
M	SEBASTIAN	In motion.
M	JOHN	Where you going?
M	SEBASTIAN	Colombia. I got a guy down there, says he can put me next to Pablo Escobar-- I'm doing this piece, I follow a single coca leaf from Colombia, to the streets of Miami.
M	JOHN	Yeah, you and I once talked about doing something like that. We were gonna call it, "From Plant to Pusher." Remember?
M	SEBASTIAN	Not really. --there was another fire at the county dump. Some kinda methane leak.
M	JOHN	Actually, it's Grogan--
M	ARNIE	I want two paragraphs for the blotter. John nods, looks off at Sebastian who now sits down at his
M	JOHN	So uh, what kind of puppy? Sebastian looks up at him.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	To, y'know, cut the wire.
M	SEBASTIAN	Get her a lab. They're supposed to be just like little kids. But easier to train.
F	JENNY	This isn't the ihop...
M	JOHN	A little surprise first...
F	LORI	Sorry about the smell.
F	JENNY	When can I look?
M	JOHN	Just hang on... Lori opens a door to a laundry room.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Okay. Now. Jenny opens her eyes and sees a utility room. Nine yellow John and Jenny.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Happy Birthday.
F	JENNY	Oh my God... they're adorable... Wait a minute, my birthday's a month from now.
F	LORI	That's okay, they can't leave for another three weeks anyway.
F	JENNY	John, we never even talked about this.
M	JOHN	You're right. Let's go. He's kidding. And besides, Jenny's already on the floor,
F	JENNY	Look at you guys...
F	LORI	I got papers on the mom and the dad, so you can register these.
M	JOHN	Is the father here too? Oh, yeah, somewhere. Anyway, girls are $400, boys are $375. Except this little guy here.
M	AND	She points to one male puppy, who is clearly the goofiest You can have him for $325.
F	JENNY	How sweet. He's on clearance...
F	LORI	Well, he's a little too stocky for the breed, so he probably won't show.
F	JENNY	He's so sweet... Marley & He Shooting Draft 18.
M	JOHN	He likes you.
F	JENNY	John, I don't know if I'm ready for a
F	LORI	You have to wait three weeks for the litter to get weaned, before you can bring 'em home anyway.
M	JOHN	Plenty of time to get ready.
F	JENNY	I won't even be here. I'm gonna be with my sister then...
M	JOHN	No problem. I can take him. Be good bonding time. Get him all trained in time for you to come home. A chuckle from Lori.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Let's give 'em all the scare test. The what?
M	JOHN	I hear the best dog in the litter is the one who doesn't spook easily. They turn out to be the most people- centered. Uh, how are you gonna-- John turns away, and then suddenly turns back with a loud
M	LORI (CONT'D)	Well, that's your guy. John scoops him up. Clearance Puppy licks his face. John
F	JENNY	I would've picked you anyway--
M	JOHN	Meant to be. He watches her cuddle the puppy and knows he's done the right
F	JENNY	You really sure about this? I mean, a puppy's a lot of work.
M	JOHN	How hard could it be? We hear A COMMOTION is coming from the woods, something
F	JENNY	What's that? Just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge,
M	JOHN	I think we just met the dad.
F	JENNY	Call me as soon as you get him home. Oh, hey, we need a name.
M	JOHN	How 'bout I just call him "Clearance Puppy" until you get back. I only hope he doesn't say his first word without you.
M	JOHN	Whoa! He got big... This is the right one, right?
F	LORI	You should see him pack away the puppy chow.
M	JOHN	So, what if I run into any problems? Oh. Sure, call me. All sales are final, though. Not just for him. I tell that to everyone. You want help getting him in the car?
M	JOHN	No, that's okay, I'll just... John opens the door, indicates that Marley should jump in.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	There we go. Well, anyway, thanks for-- But Lori's already inside her house, the door closed.
M	JOHN	Hey... guy. The dog just stares at him quizzically. Uncomfortable alone You like Bob Marley? The dog THUMPS HIS TAIL AGAIN. John turns up the music. Bob? Marley.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Marley. Okay-- Marley. Cool. But now the pup starts wriggling towards John, John tries to No-- stay boy... stay. Okay, not really safe, bud-- Marley gets stuck with half his body draped over the console.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Alright, fine, but just this time. John pulls up in the driveway and opens the jumps out.
M	JOHN	This is our house... The dog immediately pees on the ground. And now it's yours.
M	JOHN	This one's water. This one's food. Marley starts pawing the food bag.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	C'mon, man, you've already had kibble and half a seat belt. All right. Special treat. But just today... He opens the bag and Marley tackles it. Several cupfuls eaten the food in the bowl AND every last scrap of spilled
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	No, no, no! He picks up the puppy and rushes him outside.
M	JOHN	Okay, now. Pee. He motions with his zipper.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	C'mon, man, do your thing. Alright, I'm gonna show you this one time... From behind, we see John peeing.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Except you gotta lift your leg. See, this is how you guys do it... Marley looks at him, squats and pees... Or you could do it like that. Just not in front of other guy dogs. that she'll just be a second...
F	JENNY	Marley. I like that...
M	JOHN	Are you sure? Because it can be temporary...
F	JENNY	No, it's good. He must be exhausted.
M	JOHN	Oh, yeah, he's pooped. Marley lets out a SQUEAK as he tugs at a couch cushion... Oh, he sounds so sweet!
M	JOHN	Yeah... He's very cute. Just like a little kid only furrier.
F	JENNY	Put the phone by his ear... John chases after the dog who burrows under the couch, his
M	JOHN	Uh, okay, he's listening. John just holds the phone awkwardly as Jenny coos baby talk.
F	JENNY	Hey, Marley! Who's my good boy?! Mommy can't wait to meet you...
M	JOHN	Anyway, don't worry, he's doing great. Like he's lived here his whole life. All eight weeks of it. And you know what else? I think he's going to be pretty easy to train. I mean, he's curious which means he's smart, right?
F	JENNY	Of course he is. I can't wait to see him.
M	JOHN	Just him?
F	JENNY	Jealous?
M	JOHN	I'm not the one sleeping in a box.
F	JENNY	I love you. I'll see you Friday.
M	JOHN	I'll see you in the morning, okay? Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John Aw, come on, don't. You'll be fine, alright. And tomorrow, we're gonna tear it up. I'm thinking kibble, park, chew toy, the whole nine yards. Okay? we good? Marley doesn't-look so good, looks kind of sad. John turns
M	JOHN	Big day tomorrow! Rest up, pal! He listens a beat; Marley quiets down. He gets in his car.
M	SEBASTIAN	So I'm there in this cave, right? Blindfolded. And I can feel the machine guns, there's like nine of 'em around me... and they tie me to a chair and then Escobar comes in and says-- are you ready? I read your piece on Kadahfi, And I think you captured his narcissism just right. Can you believe that?
M	JOHN	Some of it.
M	SEBASTIAN	Man, I wish you could've been there.
M	JOHN	Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been able to do the piece on the water main break at the library. That would have sucked.
M	SEBASTIAN	Your time will come, amigo.
M	JOHN	I'll drink to that-- They toast with their beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at
M	SEBASTIAN	You gotta be somewhere?
M	JOHN	Oh. No, it's the puppy. It's his first
M	SEBASTIAN	You got adoc?
M	JOHN	Marley. A little lab. Like you said. Remember? The bomb...
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh, right. Smart move. You'll see. You've just preserved your quiet way of life for at least another two years.
M	NEIGHBOR	Millers got robbed again. And that mutt of yours hasn't shut up since you left. John looks towards the garage where we hear WHIMPERING.
M	JOHN	No no... I just wanted you to know I'm back. The puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay? Yeah, I know, good to see you, too. But I'm just inside the house, I'll see you in the morning. Big day tomorrow. Get some sleep.
M	JOHN	Just this one time. John climbs into bed, shuts off the light. Marley whimpers
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Oh, come on... Hey. Remember this? One love, one heart... Let's get together and feel alright... John nods off, one arm hanging over the side of the bed into Tail rising in the b.g., wagging. As John opens his eyes to see Marley snuggled up against his
M	JOHN	She comes home today. Hung over, he sits up, looks around the messy room, half due
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	We should probably clean up.
M	JOHN	Huh. It's already completely gnawed up. John looks at Marley who
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Marley, it's a screen, you're not gonna
M	GET THROUGH--	Meanwhile, Marley backs up a few steps, gets a head of steam,
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	--there.
M	JOHN	I'll be back in an hour. Be good.
F	JENNY	How's my puppy?
M	JOHN	I'm okay. A little tired, but She nudges him. He gives her another kiss.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	He's waiting for you.
F	JENNY	Marley! She takes off for the side door of the garage.
F	JENNY	Oh my God. It's a mess. It's almost incredible that it's all due to a
M	JOHN	Wow. Okay, this is not how I left it.
F	JENNY	How long has he been in here?
M	JOHN	An hour, at the most. Jeez... he Alg drywall. That's just not right.
F	JENNY	Look. He's shaking-- Another bit of THUNDER and the puppy whimpers louder.
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Does thunder scare you, Mister? Hm? He licks her face, snuggles into her. She gives him the
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Look at us. She looks up at John and smiles. He returns the smile.
F	JENNY	Marley, no! Jenny chases him into the kitchen, past John who holds up the
M	JOHN	He gave me an extra paragraph... Marley bursts through the back screen door...
M	JOHN	Marley, no! John chases him across the backyard. Marley goes under the fence and John starts to go over into...
M	JOHN	Marley, no! They wave to the NEIGHBOR standing on his patio watching.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Hi, Tom-- Sorry...
F	JENNY	Happy Thanksgiving... Marley goes through a hedge and out onto...
F	JENNY	Marley, no!
M	JOHN	I don't understand, why me?
M	ARNIE	I'm in a bind, John.
M	JOHN	But I'm a reporter, not a columnist.
M	ARNIE	It's a step up.
M	JOHN	Yeah, but it's a step away from what I wanna do.
M	ARNIE	It's also better pay, you set your own hours, pick your own topics... and it's only temporary, just until I find someone permanent.
M	JOHN	What happened to Jerry?
M	ARNIE	You may have noticed that in every other column, he went on about The Pie Palace?
M	JOHN	I really haven't read his--
M	ARNIE	Turns out he's been getting free meals in exchange for mentioning the joint. It's also why he became such a fat ass. John nods. Oh. Anyway, it's twice a week. And like I said, it's only until I can find someone else to replace him. Then you're back on, uh... whatever beat you were on. John pulls up, gets out of the car. His neighbors, The
M	GIRL	Your dog's funny. Uh, thanks.
M	GIRL	He tried to eat one of our tires.
M	JOHN	Yeah, well, dogs need rubber. Little known fact, helps the digestive tract...
M	GIRL	Right. Along with the occasional black Converse high top which I'd still love to get back by the way.
M	JOHN	I'll do what I can.
M	GIRL	'Preciate that.
F	JENNY	I think he dislocated my shoulder. He doesn't heel-- hell, he doesn't even walk, he sprints, and I had to pull him off three dogs...
M	JOHN	Poodle?
F	JENNY	Yeah, among others. There was a Yorkie, a Dalmatian and a bichon frise that may never be right again. What're you doing?
M	JOHN	Arnie gave me a column.
F	JENNY	You're kidding? Congratulations!
M	JOHN	Oh, yeah, it's a big honor. I get to write about zoning laws and yard sales.
F	JENNY	I bet you make something out of it.
M	JOHN	It's only temporary until he finds someone else. I'm just trying to get something down for Tuesday. She gives him a kiss, starts out of the room
F	JENNY	You'll think of something. And John, I'm serious abut Marley. He wreaks havoc everywhere he goes. We gotta do something...
M	MS. KORNBLUT	Incorrigible? I don't believe in that. All dogs want to learn. But they can't when their owners are weak-willed.
M	JOHN	I'm very strong-willed.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	And where is your animal?
M	JOHN	He's over there. With my wife. He was a little excited. He usually needs a little time to calm down. Ms. Kornblut looks at Jenny as she struggles up with Marley.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	I see. He calls the shots. Which of you will be the trainer?
F	JENNY	we thought we both would, since we want him to listen to both of us at home -
M	MS. KORNBLUT	A dog can only answer to one master. Which one of you has the most natural authority in your own relationship? I'll watch.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	I thought so. We begin.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	Sit! The students order their dogs to sit, and most of them do. idea. Whereas: Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her
M	MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)	That, class, is an example of a dog that has been foolishly allowed to believe he is the alpha male of his pack. And therefore he cannot be a happy animal.
M	JOHN	Yeah, he looks really bummed. Kornblut hears him, death stares John.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	You. Joker. Rotate in. John looks at Jenny who shrugs, holds up the leash for him to As Ms. Kornblut demonstrates on her wrist.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	The choke chain. When your animal walks properly by your side, there'll be slack. If he pulls, it tightens around his neck like a noose and loosens as soon as he stops pulling.
M	JOHN	Does it hurt them?
M	MS. KORNBLUT	Well, it's not called a hug chain. But they learn to like it. Go on, collar your dogs. Everyone else quickly, easily gets the choke chain around John kneels down and struggles to put it. around Marley's Much tussling, and John finally gets it around Marley's neck -
M	JOHN	He likes it.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	That's because he's eating it... Get it out of his mouth. Class? Give your dogs the sit command. All the dogs sit; John forces Marley's butt down.
M	MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)	The leash is held in two places. Loop around your right hand, left hand at waist level. Dog always on your left, of course.
M	JOHN	That means us, pal. He rearranges Marley so he's on John's left.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	Now, when you give the heel command, step off with your left foot - I don't want to see any right foot first steppers - and walk. If your dog gets ahead, administer a correction by forcefully bring your left hand down and towards the right, and he'll respond. Shall we? One, two, three - now! Just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off, Marley lurches ahead of the pack...
M	JOHN	Marley, heel! Marley takes off like a fighter jet, dragging John behind.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	Correct him! John gives a mighty yank on the leash. Marley coughs, hesitates. John loosens the leash - and Marley explodes Marley explodes forward.
M	MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)	Rein in that dog! All right, everyone, line up again. Demonstration. Mr. Grogan? Pay attention. She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into
M	MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)	It's a simple question of confidence in one's own authority. Shall I demonstrate a simple walk?
M	JOHN	Be my guest.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	Class? Even an unruly dog wants to obey his leader. Marley? Heel. And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more walking tug-of-war. With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping
M	MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)	That's it! He's out!
M	JOHN	He usually just does this with poodles. Maybe it's the hair.
M	MS. KORNBLUT	He's a bad influence on the others. Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes hold in a group - he has to go!
M	JOHN	Well, that was fun. Congratulations, Marley. You flunked obedience school.
F	JENNY	You know, John, there is something else we can do--
M	JOHN	No, no, I'm not doing that to him.
F	JENNY	It's painless. And he'll be a lot more comfortable. It'll calm him down.
M	JOHN	Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer? Because he'll have nothing to look forward to.
F	JENNY	What're you talking about? There are plenty of other things that'll make him
M	JOHN	That's where you're wrong. Trust me, Jen: I know. I'm a guy. And yeah, lots of things make us happy, but the only thing we really look forward to is sex. Runner up: the possibility of sex.
F	JENNY	Oh, Please. Every book says he'll live
M	JOHN	It'll just feel longer.
F	JENNY	John, he's out of control. It's the right thing to do. John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed "goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy.
M	JOHN	It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see. Sex is overrated. Marley looks-at him. Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know that... so maybe the best thing is to just not talk about it. Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Poor son-of-a-bitch. A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here... Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to Least I can do. John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out. Here you go... John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole He's so happy. He has no idea what's about to happen to him. Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open
F	JENNY	He's making me nervous.
M	JOHN	He's fine. He just wants a little Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until
F	JENNY	John, grab him! Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and
M	JOHN	He's onto our evil plan, and he's making a break for it! But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for
M	JOHN	Uh, little help here... John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on for dear life...
F	JENNY	I got him! What are you looking at?! He's losing his balls today! Cut the guy some slack!
M	SEBASTIAN	Strip mall get approved?
M	JOHN	Riveting planning commission vote. Knuckle-biter. 8 to 1.
M	SEBASTIAN	You up for a beer?
M	JOHN	Can't, I gotta finish the column. Maybe tomorrow?
M	SEBASTIAN	Can't, I'll be in L.A. Part of that drug piece I'm doing--
M	JOHN	Right. Another time then. John watches him move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big John chuckles to himself, then deletes the column, starts
M	JOHN	I'm really sorry, I'll go back and do the zoning piece--
M	ARNIE	The hell you sorry for? It's hilarious. John sits back down, looks at Arnie. See, the thing is, I loved it. Getting kicked out of obedience school, the humping, the "Great Escape," all of it. Hysterical. Again, Arnie's face remains dead serious as he passes the
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	Run it. As is.
M	JOHN	Thank you, sir. John starts out of the office.
M	ARNIE	Hey, Gorgan... Tell him not to feel bad. Sooner or later, we all lose our balls.
M	JOHN	I'll be sure to pass that on.
M	JOHN	To two years.
F	JENNY	That was fast.
M	JOHN	Good, though, right?
F	JENNY	Really good. He lifts out of his chair and kisses her, a long one.
M	JOHN	So. What's next?
F	JENNY	I was thinking desert.
M	JOHN	No, I mean on your list.
F	JENNY	My list?
M	JOHN	ed, Remember, when we first got marri you had this whole checklist, with like the game plan.
F	JENNY	Right...
M	JOHN	So what came next?
F	JENNY	Let's see... a new car maybe?
M	JOHN	afterthat? We can do that. What was You sure you wanna know?
M	JOHN	Yeah.
F	JENNY	well, it was between a new roof and a baby. He studies her for a long moment, then...
M	JOHN	I can probably live with a few leaks.
F	JENNY	Really? Because a leak can turn into something bigger... and that can be a big responsibility.
M	JOHN	I know.
F	JENNY	I was just thinking that we might want everything fixed before we went to the next step.
M	JOHN	Well, we've already fixed Marley. Literally. Marley & He Shooting Draft 65
F	JENNY	You're serious about this?
M	JOHN	I think so. JENNY t an And you know we're not talking abou actual roof here.
M	JOHN	Yeah, I got that. She looks back at him, finally nods. They are. Then..
F	JENNY	Okay. Maybe, instead of tying to have a baby, we should stop trying to not have one.
M	JOHN	If I'm following you correctly -- and I think I am -- this is the part where we go home and get it on, right?
F	JENNY	Bingo.
M	him.	As Jenny pushes John back onto the bed, starts kissing
F	JENNY	Honey?
M	JOHN	Yeah...
F	JENNY	Did you eat some kibble?
M	JOHN	What? And now they part and we see MARLEY'S HUGE FACE RESTING ON
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Marley-- get out of here!
M	KNOW	it's fine, he's a dog, he doesn't what he's looking at.
M	RESENTS	Oh, he knows, and trust me, he the hell out of me right now. Go on, Marley! Get out! But Marley jumps up on the bed, tries to climb on both of
F	JENNY	Marley! And now they both start laughing as the dog tries to lick
M	ARNIE	This is even funnier than the last one.
M	JOHN	Thank you, sir.
M	ARNIE	You're good, Gorgan. And not just the dog stuff. The piece on the women of Boca last week. What'd you call them?
M	JOHN	Boccahontis.
M	ARNIE	Hilarious. John nods, starts for the door...
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	Is it true what you wrote? You and the wife are trying to have a kid?
M	JOHN	Well, we're not really trying.
M	ARNIE	How's that work?
M	JOHN	Excuse me?
M	ARNIE	Are you having sex?
M	JOHN	Yes.
M	ARNIE	ant? With the intention of getting pregn
M	JOHN	i guess.
M	ARNIE	Congratulations. You're trying. John just stands there. Arnie looks back at him.
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	I assume you've thought this through?
M	JOHN	Yeah, I mean... .yeah.
M	desk.	John walks out of the office, pensive, sits down at his
M	JOHN	Grogan.
F	JENNY	I just thought I'd let you know that I'm ovulating.
M	JOHN	Oh.
F	JENNY	Just in case you wanted to come home.
F	JENNY	Like right now. the baby.
M	GIRL'S VOICE	Daddy! And now, another KID, 4-year-old girl, jumps up in and out of
M	GIRL	I wanna push the button!
M	FATHER	Daddy can't lift you right now--
M	GIRL	You said I could push the button!
M	FATHER	Alright, okay, I'll just-- He tries to pick her up without leaning over...
M	GIRL	Ow! You're hurting me!
M	FATHER	Okay, you know what? Never mind, no button! A very uncomfortable John now steps forward...
M	JOHN	You want me to give her a hand?
M	FATHER	Oh-- would you mind? John lifts the girl up to the panel. She runs her hands, Sarah! Goddammit-- And now the little girl starts bawling in concert with the
M	JOHN	Hi.
M	GIRL	Hi. John watches the young couple go, arms around each other.
M	JOHN	Hey, boy. Jenny?
F	JENNY	Out in a sec! John stands there, Marley looking at him.
M	JOHN	So. This is us not trying. The bathroom door opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky
F	JENNY	Hey, Sailor. She walks into the bedroom. John looks back at Marley as he
M	JOHN	Catch you later, buddy. And closes the door on the dog.
M	SEBASTIAN	So the puppy wasn't enough?
M	JOHN	Well, technically, we're not trying. But you know Jenny.
M	SEBASTIAN	But things are good right now, just as they are, right?
M	JOHN	Yeah, things are really good.
M	SEBASTIAN	So why change it up with a kid? I mean, have you already forgotten my little cautionary tale...
M	JOHN	The bomb, right?
M	SEBASTIAN	Yes. The bomb. And just so we're clear, the countdown sequence has been reactivated. By you.
M	JOHN	Well, it's been a few months and nothing's happened. Which actually makes me wonder if--
M	BARTENDER	Mr. Grogan? The BARTENDER sets a PHONE down in front of John.
M	BARTENDER (CONT'D)	Phone call. I loved that thing you did on your dog watching you and your wife have sex? Really funny stuff... Thanks...
M	BARTENDER	Seriously, man, your stuff is classic.
M	JOHN	Well, it's just temporary, but thanks. John cuts a look at Sebastian, picks up the phone. Hello. I just wanted to let you know that there's a naked blonde in your bed.
M	JOHN	Oh. Why don't you two get started and I'll be there as soon as I can.
F	JENNY	Very funny. Can you come home? I'll make it worth your while.
M	JOHN	Oh. Alright then. I'll see what I can do. He hangs up. Looks at Sebastian.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Uh, I'm sorry, man, but I gotta jam. I forgot, I had this thing, I gotta deal
M	SEBASTIAN	She's calling you home, isn't she?
M	JOHN	Yeah. See you later. John starts out of the bar. Sebastian calls after him.
M	SEBASTIAN	Tick tick tick!
M	JOHN	You know, this baby thing. I been thinking maybe we should take a break. You know? Obviously, it's not happening. Maybe that's nature's way of saying it's not good timing. No sound from Jenny. He struggles on. Maybe this is a sign that we're not ready for this. I mean, have we really thought this through? Because--
M	BEHIND	He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom door. From
F	JENNY	I'm pregnant.
M	JOHN	Great. Wow, that's... great.
F	JENNY	But you just said
M	JOHN	Yeah, no, I mean-- okay, this is definitely awkward now, but...
F	JENNY	You wanna start over?
M	JOHN	Can I?
F	JENNY	By all means.
M	JOHN	Thank you. Okay, well... I gotta be honest, I'm a little panicked.
F	JENNY	Are you panicking because I'm pregnant... or because you're afraid I'm going to hit you?
M	JOHN	Both. It's a twofer thing.
F	JENNY	Are you scared?
M	JOHN	No. No. Not at all. Yeah, yeah I'm pretty scared.
F	JENNY	Me, too. But we're gonna be okay. Look at me... He looks at her. She smiles at him.
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	We're gonna be okay. I believe you. He looks at her stomach, kisses her there...
M	JOHN	That's probably the last one about Marley for a while. But in about nine months, I'm gonna have a new subject, might be just as fun. Jenny's pregnant. I'm very happy for you. Have you bought her a present?
M	JOHN	What?
M	ARNIE	A gift, John. She's carrying a child. Your child. Don't you think that's worth something?
M	JOHN	Uhhh...
M	ARNIE	You don't wanna make the mistake I did. Listen to me. There's gonna come a time, she's fat, she's nauseous, her ankles are swollen, and she's gonna look at you, and this is what that look will mean: "You bastard. You did this to me. You dick, you ruined me." But then... Shooting Draft 53.
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	she's gonna remember that little ring, bracelet, anklet, whatever, that you bought her, and she's gonna feel better. Understand?
M	JOHN	Yeah. Can I just--
M	ARNIE	Go ahead. There's a jeweler on the corner. Mention my name.
F	JENNY	Oh, John, it's beautiful... She sets it down on the coffee table, then moves close to Thank you... She kisses him.
M	JOHN	I was just thinking about you when I walked by the store and saw it in the window...
F	JENNY	That is so sweet.
M	JOHN	Put it on... She turns back to the coffee table and looks around...
F	JENNY	Where'd it go? It was right here.
M	JOHN	You just put it down. It can't have
M	JUST DISAPPEARED--	And then he stops. Looks off. So does Jenny...
F	JENNY	Oh God... Marley stands a few feet away, looking strangely gleeful. A Hey, boy. Come here. Look what I got for you.
M	JOHN	We don't want any trouble...
F	JENNY	Yeah, here's a little something-- She reaches into her pocket for an moves looks at her. Is this a trick? He considers. Then he I just want to give you a treat and a big kiss. That's a boy... Inch by inch, Marley approaches her. But then, behind
M	JOHN	He made me! Go! Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John Marley back into Jenny. Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries open his
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Uh-oh.
M	JENNY (O.S.)	Dr. Jay's sending over a laxative.
M	JOHN	Yay.
M	JOHN	Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes. You know, years ago, when I pictured my life, somehow standing in my backyard hosing down dog crap in search of my bride's swallowed and recycled ass- kissing gift just didn't spring to mind. Aha! Jackpot!
F	JENNY	I think it's shinier than before. Amazing.
M	JOHN	Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only threw up eight times.
F	JENNY	My hero.
M	NURSE	How's that crazy dog of yours? I'm a big fan.
M	JOHN	Thank you.
M	NURSE	The heartbeat'll be very fast, like a little train. That's normal.
M	JOHN	Is it too soon to tell the sex? Not that I care. He can be any sex he wants. Male, female, we don't care. Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our druthers, but whatever...
M	NURSE	Shhhhh... hang on... She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending on how the baby is lying.- You're ten weeks, right?
F	JENNY	Next Monday, yes.
M	NURSE	Might be a little early for that. Let's go right to the sonogram. Did you bring your blank tape?
M	JOHN	Ready to roll.
M	NURSE	Let's get a good picture first. It'll be on the monitor there. The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's Hmmm. This one doesn't seem to be picking up anything. Excuse me, I'll be just a minute... She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside smiles down at DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse, Jenny.
M	DR. SHERMAN	Hi, guys. Let's have a look at your baby, shall we? Shooting Draft 57.
M	DR. SHERMAN (CONT'D)	All right, there we go. Good. Now, look over there. Much better resolution, right? Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen.
F	JENNY	Is there anything in there?
M	DR. SHERMAN	Not what you'd expect to see at ten weeks.
F	JENNY	Not quite ten weeks. Dr. Sherman looks at them directly. Kindly:
M	DR. SHERMAN	Jenny, I'm sorry, but there's no heartbeat. John and Jenny are still, silent.
M	DR. SHERMAN (CONT'D)	One in six pregnancies ends this way. it just happens sometimes, that's all. I'm very sorry. But you're young and healthy and in a couple of months, you can try again. Why don't you come by my office on your way out and we can talk some more. He exits. John is still holding the blank videotape. He tries to hide it from Jenny. He leaves. Jenny and John look
F	JENNY	How could this happen? What'd I do wrong?
M	JOHN	You didn't do anything--
F	JENNY	I must have. Otherwise, how could I lose it?
M	JOHN	Jenny, it's not something you have any control over. It's like the doctor said, it just happens--
F	JENNY	Not to me... I did something wrong. I know it... I did something wrong. I'm sorry, John...
M	JOHN	Don't say that--
F	JENNY	But I am-- I'm sorry--
M	JOHN	I don't need sorry. You didn't do anything! She turns away and begins to cry. John just sits there, Outside in the hall, the door to another examining room opens Jenny and John look away from each other, their pain made
M	JOHN	In a couple of months, we can try again. Okay? Jenny just looks out the window. at them. Jenny goes into the living room; Marley follows
M	JOHN	You want some tea? Hey, you know what I was thinking? We still have those tickets from your parents for the honeymoon in Ireland. We can finally do that. Take some time off. It'll be fun, clear our heads, right? Jenny? No answer. He goes into the living room and stops cold: Jenny sits on the couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning, still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll. Jenny raises one arm up towards John and John goes to the
M	DEBBY (V.O.)	Oh. He's... big.
M	JOHN	Yeah. Close to a hundred pounds. He just wants to say hi. He won't hurt you. Just stand still and be calm. You're a dog person, right?
F	DEBBY	well, actually -
M	JOHN	- Ready?
F	DEBBY	okay? John releases Marley who springs on Debby, knocking her back.
M	DEBBY (CONT'D)	I'm okay! I'm okay!
M	JOHN	He's not supposed to do that. You have to knee him. Anyway, it won't happen the whole time. Just maybe when you come home. This is everything you need to know. through the binder.
M	JENNY'S VOICE	Debby. Welcome to our home! Marley is a spirited dog who loves interaction. We've never left him before but we're sure he'll behave just as he does when we're at home. They kiss him goodbye. Get in the cab and go. Debby runs to
M	N	reads about Ireland in the guide book. Jenny sees a woma
M	JENNY'S VOICE	There are just a few things about Marley you need to know. He eats three times a day. If he looks starved, feed him again. Of course all this food has to go somewhere.
M	JENNY'S VOICE	Use the red shovel and the blue bucket. Watch your step. Don't worry about the color. He likes mangoes.
M	JENNY'S VOICE	Marley's ears get a lot of wax buildup. Once or twice while we're gone, please use cotton balls and the blue ear- cleaning stuff to clean them out. Wear old clothes and try not to breathe.
M	JENNY'S VOICE	Marley is an excellent watchdog. And in this neighborhood, that's a good thing. You can rest easy at night, knowing he's on the job.
M	JENNY'S VOICE	Thunderstorms are his weak point. Well, one of his weak points. You can give him sedatives if you think a storm is arriving. He doesn't like them, so push them down into his throat as far as they go.
M	DEBBY IS	Marley is tearing through the house, terrified. chasing him with a bottle of tranquilizers.
M	JOHN'S VOICE	We do not allow Marley to get up on any piece of furniture, chew on anything except his toys, drink out of the toilet - keep the lid closed and the brick on the lid -
M	JOHN'S VOICE	- actually, you might want to keep the bathroom door closed in general.
M	JOHN'S VOICE	Other than that, enjoy him! Thanks so much. Love, Jenny and John. Sacred Heart of Mary. Crucifixes everywhere you look, and a And if you need anything during the night, I'm right next door. The blankets are wool. Good heat in them.
F	JENNY	Oh, they're electric?
M	MRS. BUTTERLY	No, not in this house. My brother died in a fire, God rest him.
M	MRS. BUTTERLY (CONT'D)	In this room, actually. It's been re- papered. Good night. God bless. Jenny sits on the bed. The CREAKING is terrible.
F	JENNY	Look, I know we haven't had sex since... you know. But there's no way we're breaking the streak tonight.
M	JOHN	No kidding. 'Cause it's not just God watching. God, his mother... .and apparently his best friend.
M	JOHN	It's July, but I think I can see my breath.
F	JENNY	I can't feel my toes. John gets out of his bed and into Jenny's. Much SQUEAKING. My God. Shhh.
M	JOHN	It's not the mattress. It's the shrieks of over-sexed souls in hell.
F	JENNY	You wanna join them? He looks at her.
M	JOHN	Are you sure, because we don't have to...
F	JENNY	I can't help myself. Knowing it hasn't happened in this house in 50 years is a turn-on. They roll into each others' arms, the bed squeaking.
M	JOHN	Maybe she's deaf... Butterly looks at them sourly. So do the other guests. They heard us.
M	JOHN	No... He jumps as Mrs. Butterly slams the teapot on the table.
M	MRS. BUTTERLY	Tea? I'm off to Mass. Mrs. Butterly leaves. John and Jenny look at the other
M	JOHN	Wow. Any of you hear her bed squeaking last night? I hope she hits confession before Mass, that's all I can say.
M	JOHN	Hey, Debby. So how was-- -Debby hurls the binder of instructions at him.
F	DEBBY	There were eleven thunderstorms while you were away. Eleven! And you were right. He doesn't like thunderstorms!
F	JENNY	Okay, yeah, wow. Eleven, huh? That is a lot.
F	DEBBY	And those goddamned dog tranquilizers don't work!
M	JOHN	Did you give him four at a time?
F	DEBBY	I mean on humans! She hobbles to the car, tries to get in with her crutches.
M	DEBBY (CONT'D)	And just so you know, I am a dog person. But that's not a dog! That's evil with a dog face! That's also humping your leg! Lose my number!! And she gets into her car and guns it, splintering the
M	JOHN	It's only thunder... John goes back to work. We hear more THUNDER, and Marley
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Jenny?! Can you help me out here? I got twenty minutes to file this column! We follow John as he gets up from his desk, heads towards the back bedroom... Jenny? We follow him into the room, an anxious Marley close at his
F	JENNY	Luck of the Irish... She holds up a pregnancy test with a clear BLUE line, her SUPER: "Nine Months Later." He chews through a sock. He drinks out of the toilet. He Finally he goes to his bed on the floor of the bedroom. He He wakes up, suddenly alert. He looks over at Jenny. He She catches her breath, leans over to John.
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	John. John, wake up.
M	JOHN	What?
F	JENNY	I think it's time.
M	JOHN	It's okay.
F	JENNY	Ow! Suddenly, A GROWL. They turn to see Marley glaring at John.
M	JOHN	It's okay. I'm not hurting her. Jenny MOANS again and now Marley's eyes narrow. He takes a Please don't scream, honey. He'll kill me.
F	JENNY	You put the car seat in this weekend, right? They won't let us take the baby home without the car seat installed.
M	JOHN	Like I'd forget that.
M	JOHN	Come on, Marley. Help me out here. Do what you do best... Unsure, Marley licks the box. No, don't lick it, eat it! Destroy it! You can chew through drywall, man! I know you can do this! Marley catches on. He starts shredding the box.
M	JOHN	Car seat's in! Ready?
F	JENNY	Yeah. You? Marley barks from the back seat. They both turn and look at
M	JOHN	Okay. Here... Stay. Be good. Please, God. No storms. Stay.
M	JOHN	Hey, boy. Marley & Me Blue Revisions 3/07/07 69.
M	JOHN	Here's the thing: in a couple of hours, we're gonna bring the baby home. And you'd be doing me a really big favor if you didn't freak out. I'm gonna try and do the same thing. A moment later, THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and John comes in and
M	JOHN	Hey, boy... let's go outside...
F	JENNY	Hello, Marley... She crouches down, gives him a kiss, rubs his back. And that's when we hear a small, birdlike chirp and the dog freezes. Where'd that come from? We hear the coo again and this time Marley lifts one paw in
M	JOHN	You know what I think would be a bummer? If he ate the baby... She moves to the car seat and turns it around so that now we
F	JENNY	This is Patrick, Marley. Jenny unbuckles Patrick from the car seat and crouches down
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	See, he's not gonna hurt him.
M	JOHN	No, but I'm gonna have to put a lock on the diaper pail. Pack'n'Play...
F	JENNY	I have the quote right here-- Patrick crawls over Marley, who's supremely patient as
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Well, have legal call them again and get a release for it. They told me it was on the record-- Marley-- Patrick, that's his eye-- No, not you, Karla, just get the release. I'll call you back. Be gentle, Patrick! Jenny leans back in her chair, rubs her face. Then... Laundry. down...
M	THE FLOOR	To where Marley waits, eagerly vacuuming up the cereal. It
F	JENNY	I need to go in tomorrow for a few hours, see my editor. Think you can watch the baby for me?
M	JOHN	Sure. John looks around the room. The place is a disaster area.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Remember us?
F	JENNY	You mean, those younger, skinnier better looking people? Yeah, I think I remember them. Vaguely.
M	JOHN	Well, I miss them. He turns back to his work. She looks at him, sets her pad
F	JENNY	They're still here. He looks up at their reflection in the window, not so sure. John sits up, immediately starts to get out of bed...
F	JENNY	Honey, don't go out there.
M	JOHN	Stay here. Call the police.
M	GIRL	He said not to scream or he'd stab me, but I screamed... And John sees the blood on her shirt. He takes hold of her.
M	JOHN	Okay okay okay, I've got you... Where's your mom?
M	GIRL	At work...
M	JOHN	Jenny'll call her... Marley sniffs at the ground, growling more and more intensely. We hear SHOUTING, "He went that way" as several Marley! NO! But he's gone and John has to stay with the girl. We hear
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	All this time we've been living here, I never got your name.
M	GIRL	Lisa.
M	JOHN	Well, you're gonna be alright, Lisa, the police are on the way... John looks off, wondering where Marley is...
M	JOHN	I can't find him anywhere.
F	JENNY	Maybe we should get in the car, drive around.
M	JOHN	I'll get the keys... John's coming into the house when a police cruiser pulls to
F	JENNY	Marley!
M	JOHN	Where were you?
M	OFFICER	We found him outside the 76 station on Radford. He had the guy cornered in the men's room.
F	JENNY	So you caught the guy? jig caught the guy. He also gnawed the barrel of my shotgun, and ate half my radio mic. They look at Marley wagging his tail, panting.
M	OFFICER (CONT'D)	Anyway, the neighbors all said he belonged here, but none of them wanted to drive him, so...
M	JOHN	Thanks for bringing him home.
M	OFFICER	Helluva dog. John nods as The Officer heads back to his car. Jenny
F	JENNY	My hero.
M	JOHN	Stay. --and starts to unhook Patrick from his car seat. Marley Marley!
M	JOHN	Hi. The Realtor smiles awkwardly at him.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Can I see a set-up, please?
M	REALTOR	Certainly. First home?
M	JOHN	No, we live up in West Palm, over on Churchill?
M	REALTOR	Ooooh. Well, I think you'd find this neighborhood to be quite a pleasant change. And now Marley bolts past him into the house, tracking wet
M	REALTOR (CONT'D)	Oh... my... hello...
M	JOHN	Hey, who's dog is that?
M	JOHN	Jenny? A wet Marley bounds into the house, heads for the back. John
M	THE	Jenny is crouched on the floor when John appears in doorway.
M	JOHN	Hey. You alright? She stands up, smiles the best she can.
F	JENNY	I'm fine. Where you guys been?
M	JOHN	I wanna show you something.
F	JENNY	What?
M	JOHN	A house. It's a little pricey, but I think we can do it.
F	JENNY	John, I know we've talked about it, but I'm not sure this is the right time.
M	JOHN	And when would the right time be, Jen? After one of us gets stabbed in the driveway?
M	JOHN	C'mon, honey, we're cramped in here. This was supposed to be our three-year house, remember?
F	JENNY	I know, but we can't afford to buy a new one.
M	JOHN	Sure, we can. With both our salaries--
F	JENNY	Yeah, about that... I don't think I'm gonna be able to keep working. I'm pregnant.
M	JOHN	What? Are you sure? She steps away, revealing the counter where FOUR PREGNANCY
F	JENNY	Very.
M	SEBASTIAN	Already? I mean, how old's the one you got?
M	JOHN	About eight months.
M	SEBASTIAN	Jesus. Haven't you heard of birth control?
M	JOHN	Yeah, well, sometimes it doesn't work. You know what else doesn't work? The one about how "A dog will stop your wife's biological clock."
M	SEBASTIAN	Hey, I'm not the one, keeps getting her pregnant. John gives him a look, sees Arnie heading into his office,
M	JOHN	Wish me luck.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm sure he'll give you the raise.
M	JOHN	How do you know?
M	SEBASTIAN	He always gives me one. John just shakes his head, starts for Arnie's office.
M	ARNIE	Why should I do this, why are you worth it?
M	JOHN	Because I'm doing a good job?
M	ARNIE	Are you asking me?
M	JOHN	Well, since I took over, the column has doubled in readership...
M	ARNIE	So you are doing a good job.
M	JOHN	Yes, sir.
M	ARNIE	So why not make it permanent?
M	JOHN	You mean, like forever?
M	ARNIE	That's what the word "forever" means. Yes. John, you know how many yo yo's in the other room would kill to have their own column? You took a piece of crap About Towner and turned it into something fresh. I hate to break it to you, son, but you're a good columnist.
M	JOHN	I just had this idea about myself, you know, that I was a reporter.
M	ARNIE	Yeah, well sometimes life comes up with a better idea. Tell you what. You make it a daily column and I'll double your salary. How's that?
M	JOHN	Hey, Lisa.
F	LISA	Hi. You're leaving.
M	JOHN	Yeah.
F	LISA	well, I don't blame you. I just thought I'd come over and say-- But Marley comes running over and she crouches down to greet I'm gonna miss you. John watches as she holds on to him a bit longer, thanking
M	LISA (CONT'D)	Where you moving to?
M	JOHN	Boca.
F	LISA	Huh.
M	JOHN	Huh... what?
F	LISA	Nothing. I just... never pictured, you know, a guy like you moving to Boca.
M	JOHN	A guy like me?
F	LISA	Yeah, you know, young, cool, whatever.
M	JOHN	So you think I'm young and cool. And you're not just saying that because I saved your life?
F	LISA	Actually, a paramedic named Josh saved my life.
M	JOHN	Right. Well, take care, Lisa. Oh,
M	WAIT--	He reaches into a moving box, pulls out a chewed-up black
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I believe this belongs to you.
F	LISA	Thanks. I'll have to chew up the other one to make it match. Have fun down there.
M	JOHN	Yeah. It's gonna be great.
F	JENNY	Shhh, honey. Come on. John follows now...
M	JOHN	Is he wet?
F	JENNY	No. And I can't get a burp out of him. I think it's colic.
M	JOHN	Want me to drive him?
F	JENNY	We can't do that every night. From the other room, we HEAR Patrick CRYING, "Mommy!"
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Oh, Jesus.
M	JOHN	I'll do the washer.
M	JOHN	Any ideas?
F	JENNY	Can you take him? I just need a minute to myself. John takes the baby and instantly Conor starts crying louder.
M	JOHN	Happens every time.
F	JENNY	You just need to spend more time with him.
F	JENNY	It's okay, I'll do it.
M	JOHN	I'm doing it! It's fine! You tell me to spend more time with him, I do it, and then you take over because I'm not doing it right.
F	JENNY	I don't want you changing him when you're mad.
M	JOHN	I'm not mad! He hears himself, lets her change the baby. She takes him,
F	JENNY	Conor, come on... Conor, please... She finally stops trying, rocks the chair, looks helplessly I don't know what's wrong with me. Mothers are supposed to be able to give their baby everything.
M	JOHN	He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out of it.
F	JENNY	Okay, here's an idea, you stay here and I'll go to work while he grows out of it. He holds up his hands, what does he say to that. She looks
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	I'm just tired, alright? Go on. She then resumes trying to nurse the baby. He walks out of It's post partum depression...
M	ARNIE	Her hormones are all on tilt and she's depressed. It happens. After my fourth kid was born, I'd wake up, find my wife just staring at me with a mallet in her hand. I thought she was gonna kill me in my sleep. I still do... Did you get her the gift?
M	JOHN	Yeah.
M	ARNIE	Huh. That usually works. Arnie gets off the desk, says to the Photographer:
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	Alright, Janice, make him look pretty. The man's an official columnist now. Arnie moves off and the photographer looks up from her camera
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	You have a Barney sticker in your--
M	JOHN	Oh-- thanks. He rakes his fingers through his hair, grabs the offending I must look like hell... I don't think I've had a full night sleep in two months.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Stress?
M	JOHN	Kids. I got one with colic, and another, can't make it through the night without coming into my room every two hours.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Well, I think you're holding up great. You look cute.
M	JOHN	Really?
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Yeah, like a cute, exhausted Dad. It's adorable. John just nods stupidly, the dagger so deep in his heart,
M	PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)	You certainly look a lot better than Jerry ever looked. I tried to get him to take a new picture, but he liked the one they took the day he started the column, nineteen years ago.
M	JOHN	Nineteen years, huh... And just when he thought one dagger was brutal enough, his expression goes really pensive. And on that look, we see a "What're you doing? Get in here!" John quickly gets out of the car...
M	JOHN	I'll get him. John leaves the room. Jenny sits there.
M	PATRICK	Mommy? Jenny wakes up on autopilot.
F	JENNY	Okay, honey, let's go back to bed. She leads him out of the room. And a second later Conor
M	JOHN	Jen, you okay?
M	REVERSE - ON JENNY	She's crying, her back to John who's now in the b.g. A moment, then...
F	JENNY	I'm fine.
F	JENNY	You ruined it! Bad dog! She leaves the room and John looks at the dog.
M	JOHN	You just had to eat the book? What, have you got some kind of death wish? I'm telling you, you better chill, or she'll kill you. Right after she kills me.
M	PATRICK	Look! Jenny turns and sees A BUS, with John's picture on the side,
M	PATRICK (CONT'D)	Daddy!
F	JENNY	Uh-huh. I see him. And she goes back to loading the car.
F	JENNY	Stay. She now lays down and closes her eyes. A moment of peace. And now Conor's crying.
F	JENNY	Why do you do this?! Why do you wreck everything! Why?!! She hauls her hand back to hit him, but hesitates, and just
M	JOHN	Why's Marley out in the--
F	JENNY	I want that dog out of here.
M	JOHN	Okay. I'll take him out. She looks up at him.
F	JENNY	I want you to get him out of here and keep him out of here. What'd he do--
F	JENNY	I mean it, John. I want him gone. I want him gone for good. A sad John posts a "DOG FOR SALE" sign. A CO-WORKER sign and smiles.
M	CO-WORKER	That the dog in your column? Obed ience school? Necklace in the poop? Good luck.
M	PUTS	John watches the guy walk off, scribbles a new it up. This one reads "E F D TO GOOD HOME." comes up to John.
M	SEBASTIAN	You giving up the dog? i thought yo u loved that thing.
M	JOHN	Jenny wants him out.
M	SEBASTIAN	That's harsh, man.
M	JOHN	I don't know what else to do. She's really unhappy. Maybe the dog is just one too many things.
M	SEBASTIAN	They're all unhappy. Trust me. Well... who knows? Maybe you'll get lucky and nobody'll want him. John just nods, thinks about that. Sebastian glances around,
M	SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)	Listen, there's something I gotta tell you. I'm leaving the paper.
M	JOHN	What?
M	SEBASTIAN	I just gave Arnie my notice. John looks over at Arnie's office, the door's closed.
M	SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)	He's not too happy about it. He called me an ungrateful quizzling and threw a stapler at me.
M	JOHN	You going over to the Post?
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm going to New York. Sebastian smiles. John doesn't move.
M	SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)	The Gray Lady came courting last week. I'm talking about the New York
M	JOHN	I know who you're talking about.
M	SEBASTIAN	You don't seem happy for me.
M	JOHN	I am. I'm just in shock. I mean, I'm in Florida because of you. Woodward and Bernstein. Remember? That was the idea.
M	SEBASTIAN	Yeah, that was the idea before you decided to be the Andy Rooney of South Florida.
M	JOHN	I didn't decide to be anything--
M	SEBASTIAN	Exactly. Boom. That hurts John. They stand there a moment, considering each other, then. Look, man, you're happy doing your thing and I'm not trying to piss on that. I mean it, you're good at it. I just wanted you to be the first to know. That's all. Marley & He Shooting Draft
M	JOHN	Smart boy. Yeah, uh... Monday, then. Give us weekend.
M	EMPLOYEE	Up to you. John looks at the dogs in the back, all of them trying to get
M	ARNIE	These are all responses to the column you wrote last week. John thinks a moment... One where you said you may have to give the dog away.
M	JOHN	Oh. I assume they all want me to keep him.
M	ARNIE	No. They're all saying they'd take him. Arnie moves on and John stares at the letters. Marley follows, jumping up, trying to get the toys back out
M	JOHN	You can't lo any more of these, ok ay? Because they s e 're not gonna keep getting you more, and I won't be there to look for them... He looks at Marley standing there wagging his tail.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	You're gonna be fine, alright. I'll just be different. Maybe e it'll, b better, nobody poking your yanking your tail. Who knows? Could be better.
M	JOHN	He's all packed up. Patrick will want to say good-bye, but Conor's too young
F	JENNY	You can't do this.
M	JOHN	What do you mean? Three days ago, you were pretty clear--
F	JENNY	I know, but you can't do it. I won't let you. You can't give away Marley.
M	JOHN	Okay, wait. I'm lost. You told me you didn't want him around. What's happened?
F	JENNY	The fact that you would have done something like that, for me, that you love me that much... well, that blows me away. And we're not doing this. It was wrong of me to ask. He comes over and sits down beside her. Maybe not, maybe Marley is one thin too many.
F	JENNY	I got overwhelmed, John. I mean, be. one tells you how hard it's gonna
M	JOHN	Which part?
F	JENNY	All of it. Marriage. Being a parent. It's the hardest thing in the world and no one prepares you for that. No one tells you how much you have to give up. me. I gave up so much of what makes me But I'm not allowed to say that. People think you're a bad person if you say that. But it's how I feel sometimes, and I need you to know that.
F	JENNY	It's not your fault. It's just something I have to figure out. But Marley going, that won't fix anything.
M	JOHN	Okay. Okay. She kisses him on the cheek, then gets up and goes into the to how they've At the end of the hall, panting, oblivious both just been spared.
M	JOHN	I made reservations at Sunny's. Thought we could all sit outside.
F	JENNY	Sounds perfect. Thank you.
F	JENNY	To a perfect day with my boys.
M	BEHIND THEM	A blonde Boca Trophy wife, with a poodle on a jeweled leash, shrieks excitedly as she meets up with another woman, same
M	ON JOHN AND JENNY	As suddenly their table suddenly leaps away from them and The four Grogans sit facing each other across, their drinks Marley is pulling the table, like a dog with a sled, towards
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Marley! John hurries after the dog; Jenny stays with the boys. As Marley-with-table approaches the small dogs, they break There's a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza; Marley- and-table take out most of the merchandise. Security guards look around wildly. It's pandemonium, but one poor poodle runs for her life. Finally, back where Marley started, the terrified toy poodle
M	JOHN	Marley, no! - and suddenly, he is jerked back. John has tackled the in the world. Everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Jen, you okay? Jenny? And she slowly looks up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, her whole
F	JENNY	Boys, say hello to Colleen... We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Patrick, now six and Conor four, Sphynx, the baby, colleen in a portable bassinet beside him.
F	JENNY	John, telephone.
M	CONOR	Mom, look what we did!
M	JOHN	Hello?
F	JENNY	Who was on the phone?
M	JOHN	Philadelphia Inquirer. She looks at him.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	They're offering me a job. As a reporter. I guess the editor was down here on vacation, read my stuff.
F	JENNY	What'd you say?
M	JOHN	I said thank you very much, but I'm happy where I am. I mean, it's a big change, Florida to Pennsylvania.
F	JENNY	Yes, it is.
M	JOHN	Anyway. John smiles at her, then goes to his sons... C'mon, guys, back to work... She watches as he kneels down beside the boys, resumes digging alongside them.
M	JOHN	Well, that's part of the job. To get reader response.
M	ARNIE	re? You notice any recurring themes the
M	JOHN	Yeah. We've got a lot of cranks in Broward County.
M	ARNIE	Yeah. Including yï¿½gu the last couple months. ".. .if he doesn't like it here, he
M	FROM YOUR	should move"... "more whining resident malcontent"... "is there anything good about Florida according to Mr. Grogan?"
M	JOHN	Arnie, I'm a commentator. We've got issues here. Over-crowding, crime, immigration tensions, runaway
M	ARNIE	Florida hasn't soured, John. You have. What's wrong?
M	JOHN	I don't know. Maybe it's turning 40 next week, or maybe...
M	ARNIE	Maybe what?
M	JOHN	Maybe I'm sick of my column. I don't really think I'm all that interesting.
M	ARNIE	Are you kidding? You're the comic voice of South Florida's middle class. You're a national treasure. Well, a regional treasure. Municipal treasure, for sure. You're just a little burned out. Why don't you take a coupweeks off? Consider it my birthday present. Jenny is standing there, holding Colleen. Conor, aged 5 and
F	JENNY	Happy birthday, honey! And he kisses Jenny. Hugs the kids. Jenny watches him as he i en t e d , distracted.
M	here.	John , closes John petsdthe dog, rta es up , g greets John. k
M	JOHN	Forty. Jesus Christ... He looks at Marley a moment, then...
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Hey, buddy, you and me are the same age. You got more grey hair than me, though... Mind if I just hang here for a minute? And sits on the floor, his back against the washing machine.
M	JOHN	Okay, who wants to help me here? Kids? Marley, you too. Jenny squats down with the cake, and John and his kids start One, two - And then Marley jumps the gun, takes a huge bite of the cake, - three. of the floating lights have gone out. Jenny comes out.
F	JENNY	Okay, tell the truth, were you really surprised?
M	JOHN	Yeah. Thanks, Jen. She sits down on his lap...
F	JENNY	You want your present?
M	JOHN	Is it what you gave me last year? Because that was real nice-- She hands him an envelope.
F	JENNY	Happy Birthday. He opens it, pulls out an AIRLINE TICKET.
M	JOHN	A plane ticket?
F	JENNY	To Philadelphia. So you can talk to the editor of the inquirer.
M	JOHN	That was months ago--
F	JENNY	I called the editor last week. They'd still like to meet you.
M	JOHN	Jenny, I couldn't do that, uproot us. We've got our friends, the schools...
F	JENNY	First of all, you don't even have the job yet, it's just an interview. Second of all, you don't have that many friends.
M	JOHN	Thank you. What I was trying to say, is that our life is here.
F	JENNY	Baby, I got news for you, our life is wherever we are. And you're not happy here anymore, doing that column. You're restless, John. I feel it. I feel it when you read Sebastian's articles every day. And I feel it when you sit out in the driveway an extra five minutes before you come in. Maybe it's time for a change.
M	JOHN	I'm forty, Jen. Seems kinda late for that.
F	JENNY	Not so late. She stands up in the dark, lifts her dress over her head.
M	JOHN	What're you doing?
F	JENNY	We're not old, John. We can still surprise ourselves. He sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool. She surfaces and smiles at him.
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Hey. You want your other birthday present or not?
M	INTO	John can't get out of his clothes fast enough. He leaps
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	We're not old. And then we hear ANOTHER splash.
M	JOHN	Uh-oh... And a moment later Marley's head goes bobbing by.
M	out of his	As John packs up his desk. Arnie sticks his head office.
M	ARNIE	Hey, Gorgan. John smiles to himself, walks over.
M	ARNIE (CONT'D)	I just wanted to say good luck up there.
M	JOHN	Thank you, sir.
M	ARNIE	Also, there's a good chance that every piece of advice I ever gave you, may in fact be total crap.
M	JOHN	I appreciate it just the same. They stand there a moment, awkward. Then...
M	ARNIE	This would be where a mushier guy would tell you he's proud of you, give you a hug, and send you on your way.
M	JOHN	Really glad you're not that guy, sir. Arnie nods, goes back into his office and shuts the door. The Grogans are in the back of the plane.
M	JOHN	Look. There's Marley! THROUGH THE WINDOW they can see Marley's crate arriving at
M	CONOR	Hey, Marley! We're up here!
M	PATRICK	He can't hear you with the engine going.
M	JOHN	Not to mention the tranquilizers. I think he's already reached his cruising altitude. they made it this far, when he freezes. A MUFFLED MOAN is coming from beneath his feet. Clearly it's
M	PASSENGER	is that a dog?
M	JOHN	Maybe, I don't know.
M	PATRICK	Marley's Sad. Marley's our dog. He's with the suitcases. John smiles weakly at the Passenger.
M	JOHN	What an imagination, huh? We don't have a dog. He makes the crazy sign with his finger, gesturing at running...
M	JOHN	Marley! Marley jumps into a pile of leaves, scatters them everywhere, And... we're home. desk. John sits down at his cubicle, stares out the window
M	EDITOR	Hey, John. Settling in okay?
M	JOHN	I'm fine, thanks.
M	EDITOR	Good. I want you to meet Billy... He indicates the twenty-something guy beside him. John and
M	EDITOR (CONT'D)	Billy's gonna show you the ropes.
M	BILLY	You're the Florida guy, right? The dog columns...
M	JOHN	Well, some of them were, but--
M	BILLY	Cute stuff. C'mon, I'll show you around.
M	JOHN	What? And then Conor and Patrick burst into the room.
M	PATRICK	It's here!
F	JENNY	Okay, time for lunch!
M	JOHN	I'll bring this in. Go on up. The kids and Marley head up to the house. John drags the
F	JENNY	Honey, what're you doing?
M	JOHN	I can't remember the last time I rode on a toboggan..
F	JENNY	Exactly. He starts sliding down the hill. Marley runs for him as he
M	JOHN	Marley, no! But Marley jumps onto John's lap as they get going...
M	ON THE TOBOGGAN	Flying down the hill. Marley is much heavier than the kids,
F	JENNY	John! The creek! The toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails comes up and romps with him.
M	JOHN	Hey... wanna do it again?
F	JENNY	John! From the low angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side, itself as Marley lifts it to look at John standing there.
M	JOHN	That's alright, pal. I won't tell. We kicked ass down that hill, didn't we? John smiles at him and continues up to bed. A moment later, a yellow dot appears on the horizon. As it
M	PATRICK	Hey, boy. We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as the boys start up the road Patrick's backpack.
M	JOHN	Hit me, I'm open! Patrick throws the ball to John who catches it, mocks stiff-
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	My God, look at Grogan-- two three- hundred pound linemen literally hanging off him, but he won't be denied! And now Marley jumps on them.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from the Strong Safety and the unthinkable happens... GROGAN GOES DOWN... And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps,
F	COLLEEN	Mommy says dinner and take off your shoes.
M	JOHN	Alright... c'mon guys... They all get up, start up the steps. Marley follows, takes You okay, boy? C'mon... Marley tries the second step and again his legs give out. He looks up at them...
M	CONOR	What's wrong with him, Daddy? Nothing's wrong. He's just tired. Right, Dad? John sees the way Patrick is looking at him, knows he's
M	JOHN	That's right. Football just took it out of him. C'mon, let's give him a hand. And now the three of them go to Marley, help him up the stairs.
M	JOHN	Too much color.
M	EDITOR	Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good piece, but... you're reporting now, John. I want you to tell the story, I don't want you to be in the
M	JOHN	I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself--
M	EDITOR	The point is, I still feel you in there. John sits there, thinking about that.
M	EDITOR (CONT'D)	All I'm saying is: less you, more facts. wince at once...
M	CONOR	Marley! They all begin waving their hands in front of their faces.
F	JENNY	I think someone needs to go out. Come on, boy... Marley gets to his feet, follows John to the front door.
M	JOHN	It's pouring out there... He grabs his slicker and heads back out...
M	JOHN	Marley! Now Jenny appears in the front door.
F	JENNY	What's wrong?
M	JOHN	He's not coming.
F	JENNY	Marley! John starts off into the dark...
M	JOHN	He can't be too far...
M	She looks at	John comes into the kitchen - without Marley. him with concern... he start out of the room.
M	JOHN	He'll show up.
M	JOHN	He's just out exploring. You know how much he likes the woods.
M	PATRICK	Bobby says dogs, when they're going to die, they go away to do it. That's what his beagle did.
M	JOHN	And that's true... for beagles. But not labs like Marley. He's just out there making trouble somewhere. Don't worry...
M	JOHN	Okay. Well, if you see him... thanks. He hangs up, goes to the window.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I'm gonna get in the car, maybe drive Jenny. Shooting Draft 109.
M	JOHN	
F	DR. PLATT	He's on an IV for fluids and a sedative.
M	JOHN	So what happened?
F	DR. PLATT	His stomach twisted. He ate or drank something quickly, took in a lot of air and his stomach flipped. I got a tube down which let out some of the gas. I think i untwisted it.
M	JOHN	So he's okay...
F	DR. PLATT	For now. But once this happens, it almost always happens again. And if it does, there's not gonna be anything I can do. He's too old for that kind of surgery.
M	JOHN	What if it doesn't happen again?
F	DR. PLATT	More than likely, it will.
M	JOHN	But what if it doesn't?
F	DR. PLATT	I just think you should prepare yourself that he might not make it through the night. Maybe one percent of dogs ever survive
M	JOHN	One percent? What's that number based on?
F	DR. PLATT	Mr. Grogan--
M	JOHN	I'll tell you what it's based on: regular dogs. Lady, we are so far from 'regular", you have no idea. My guy here... He once ate an entire answering machine, and digested it. Then went back and ate the phone for dessert. So don't give me numbers like "one percent," because you don't know him. But I do, and I'll see him in the morning. We TRACK WITH JOHN as he storms out of the exam room, walks We stay BEHIND HIM as he leans with one hand on his car, and
M	JOHN	We're just gonna have to wait and see. If he makes it through the night, I think we'll be alright. He notices the album.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	What're you looking at?
F	JENNY	Your old columns. He's in a lot of 'em. John rotates the album for a better look.
M	JOHN	You saved these?
F	JENNY	Every one. He looks up at her.
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Even on the crappiest day, when the boys were driving me nuts and the laundry wasn't done and a hundred other things were hard, I knew I had this. Five minutes of you. Sometimes they were funny and sometimes they were sad, or silly or whatever, but they were all you. And for those five minutes, you made me feel better. She gets up, comes over to him, leans down and kisses his
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	You should read them. They're pretty great.
M	JOHN	Hello? Alright. Thank you. He hangs up, sees Jenny now standing in the doorway, tying He's coming home.
M	COLLEEN (O.S.)	Marley's back! John opens the tail gate just as the kids come rushing onto
M	JOHN	Nice place. How long you been here?
M	SEBASTIAN	Two years, little more. Sebastian sees John looking at all of the unpacked boxes.
M	SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)	I'm in and out of town so much I really haven't had a chance to settle in. I hired a decorator, but she and I got into a thing and it got messy--
M	JOHN	Right.
M	SEBASTIAN	Beer?
M	JOHN	I can't, I still got one more interview to do.
M	A	Sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but beer and
M	SEBASTIAN	What's the piece again?
M	SEBASTIAN	Right, you told me that. So you're down in Philly now, huh?
M	JOHN	Just outside. More space for the kids.
M	SEBASTIAN	Whatta you got, five now?
M	JOHN	Three. Here's a picture of everybody... John pulls a photo from his wallet, hands it to Sebastian. Jenny's holding up.
M	JOHN	Yeah, she's great. And that's Colleen our youngest...
M	SEBASTIAN	What's with the ladybug get-up?
M	JOHN	Oh, yeah, that's a funny story. She had done this pageant at her preschool two weeks before, but she didn't wanna take off the costume, plus Marley went ballistic for the antenna which is why it looks like he's trying to eat her head. Yeah, that is funny. So I was thinking later on maybe Thai? There's this new place in the meat Packing District. How's that sound? Be just like old times. John stands there a moment, feeling the distance between them.
M	JOHN	Uh, well, actually I'm headed back home later today.
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh.
M	JOHN	In fact, I should probably get going...
M	SEBASTIAN	Alright. Good seeing you, man.
M	JOHN	For sure.
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh, hey, be sure to check out the Delegates Lounge at the U.N... Great Mojitos, really hot interpreters.
M	JOHN	Thanks for the tip. And John goes out the door. Sebastian takes out his blackberry, dials...
M	SEBASTIAN	Hey, it's Sea-bass. What're you up to tonight? Oh. No, that's cool. Another time then. He hangs up, stands there in the middle of his big, empty
M	SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)	Hey, it's Sea-bass. What's going on?
M	JOHN	Hello? Anybody home? He sees a note ("PICKING UP THE KIDS. J"), and peers into:
M	THE KITCHEN	Where Marley is up on his hind legs, eating something off the
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Marley? Hey, boy. Marley looks up briefly as if he heard something, but then out and touches Marley, and Marley jumps, totally guilty. What's the matter, boy? You didn't hear me? Huh? He looks at the dog a moment, thoughtful, then...
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Let's go for a walk.
M	JOHN	Come on, boy, just a little further to the top... Marley comes up, panting, eyes wet and happy. John looks at
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	You know what, this is a good spot right here. John looks out at the valley below, settles down onto the
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Let's just sit for a while. The two of them sit there, looking out at the beautiful countryside below. John strokes Marley for a moment. Looks
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Hey. So... you're gonna tell me, right? When it's time? Because I don't wanna make that decision on my own. So you just let me know when you're ready, okay? Marley rests his chin on John's arm. Okay.
F	JENNY	Marley? Have you seen him?
M	JOHN	He's not up here. John and Jenny find Marley lying peacefully in front of the
M	JOHN	I guess I could move his bed down here. John sits down beside Marley.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Man. He's always slept with us. Now he can't even make it upstairs.
F	JENNY	He looks pretty comfortable to me. I'll go get his bed.
M	JOHN	Hey Jen? why don't you grab a blanket for me, too. She nods, starts back up the stairs. John grabs a pillow
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	This is a good spot. I may never sleep upstairs again. Hey. Scooch over. He looks up and see that Jenny's brought a blanket. She lies
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	Just like old times.
M	JOHN	It'd be twice a week. Six hundred words.
M	EDITOR	And what's the subject?
M	JOHN	Everyday stuff. The stuff we all go through. But funnier.
M	EDITOR	I don't get it. I thought you came here to be a reporter.
M	JOHN	I did, but I think we both know that isn't me. I'm a columnist. A good one. A SECRETARY sticks her head in the office...
M	SECRETARY	John-- your wife's on the phone. She says it's important...
M	JOHN	I'll be right there. Think about it.
F	JENNY	I can't get him back inside. He's lying out there in cold... and he won't move...
F	JENNY	Patrick came home and we got him here. Dr. Platt said if he's comfortable, leave him here for a while and see. But he's no better. John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag
M	JOHN	I'm taking him in. The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed
F	COLLEEN	Is he sick again?
M	JOHN	Yeah, he is, honey. But I'm going to take him to the hospital and they'll try to make him better. Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face.
M	CONOR	Get better, Mar.
F	COLLEEN	You can take Lamby, okay? But don't chew her other ear off. Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in
M	PATRICK	Goodbye. When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's
M	JOHN	You wanna walk? He sets him down gingerly. Hesitantly, Marley walks over to looks around. John looks around, too. It's a crisp spring
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Nice night, huh? Marley looks around, then looks at John. There's something
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Okay, boy. Okay. John, his heart breaking, bends down to carry Marley up the
F	DR. PLATT	I did everything that worked before. But no luck. There's still surgery,
M	JOHN	--not strong enough.
F	DR. PLATT	There's blood in his stomach. The lining might be compromised. I don't know what we'll find if we go in there anyway.
M	JOHN	Can you give me a minute? I need to... I need to call my wife. It's me. It's the stomach thing again. Nothing's working. They could do surgery, but...
F	JENNY	I know. Jenny nods as tears come. They stay on the phone, quiet,
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	I love you, John. I love you.
F	DR. PLATT	I'll give you some time. She goes. John stares down at Marley. Takes the stuffed
M	JOHN	Hey, buddy. He pets Marley's head, runs his hands all over Marley's body.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Listen, you know all that stuff we always said about you? What a total pain you are? The world's worst dog? Well, don't you believe it. Don't believe it for a minute. You loved us, every day, no matter what. And that's a pretty amazing thing. Look, I don't know where you're going from here, but you remember this: You're a great dog, Marley. You are a great dog.
F	DR. PLATT	He won't feel a thing. He'll just slip away. Are you ready?
M	JOHN	We're ready. Dr. Platt inserts the needle into the I.V. and presses the TWO-YEAR-OLD PATRICK rides on Marley's back through the house heart and says:
F	DR. PLATT	He's gone. FROM ABOVE, the dog on the table, the doctor discreetly going small grave has been dug. John sets Colleen down...
F	COLLEEN	He's wrapped in his blanket...
M	JOHN	So he'll be warm.
F	JENNY	You guys want to read your letters?
F	COLLEEN	Mine is a picture. Of me and Marley. And grasshoppers. And ice cream. Mommy wrote what I said. "Dear Marley. I will never forget you, forever." And those are kisses.
M	JOHN	It's beautiful, honey. He'll like it. Drop it in. Conor? Conor reads his piece of paper.
M	CONOR	"Dear Marley. I loved you all my life. I hope you like heaven and that there's lots to chew on. Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan." John puts his hand on Conor's shoulder as Conor drops in the
F	JENNY	Patrick? Do you want to say anything?
M	PATRICK	He knows.
F	JENNY	I'd like to give him something. Jenny reaches behind her neck and unclasps the gold necklace
M	JENNY (CONT'D)	This little necklace has been on quite a journey. John smiles at her, remembering. So much shared history.
M	JOHN	Your dad gave this to me to celebrate the beginning of our family. But you know what? Our family had already begun. She looks into the grave, gently sets the necklace atop the
F	JENNY	Good-bye, Clearance Puppy. All lit up. We see the kids sitting by the fire while Jenny John sits there watching them. watching his family. The family that both he and Marley grew up in. He gives the fresh dirt a final, loving pat and then, as the
