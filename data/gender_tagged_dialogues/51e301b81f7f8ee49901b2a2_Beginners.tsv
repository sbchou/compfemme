M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ANDY	Okay. Is it on? (recorder)
M	OLIVER	Yeah yeah.
M	ANDY	This is for our friend Hal Fields. Hal. We love you.
M	OLIVER	You're coming to live with me now. Arthur looks at him.
M	OLIVER	This is my car. Arthur hops in.
M	OLIVER	This is the dining room where people come and eat sometimes. The dog listens intently. Oliver moves on, the dog follows.
M	OLIVER	This is the living room.
M	OLIVER	That's the bathroom. The dog looks.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	This is 2003. This is what the sun looks like, and the stars, nature. This is the President.
M	OLIVER V.O.	And this is the sun in 1955, and the stars, and nature, and cars, and phones, and movies, and the President. These are what pets looked like. These are fireworks. This was smoking. This is what it looked like when people kissed...
M	OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	...When they were happy... ...When they were sad.
M	OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	My parents got married in 1955.
M	OLIVER	He was a museum director - she fixed up old houses.
M	OLIVER	They had a child, and they stayed married for 44 years...
M	OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	...Until she died in their bed, after four months of cancer and eating French toast for every meal and watching the Teletubbies everyday and confusing white straws for her cigarettes and skipping back and forth through time inside her head.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Six months later, my father told me he was gay. He had just turned 75.
M	HAL	I'm gay. Same camera angle, Hal still looking into camera we jump cut
M	OLIVER V.O. (CONT'D)	I always remember him wearing a purple sweater when he told me this but actually he wore a robe.
M	HAL	I'm gay. Same angle, we continue to jump cut through Hal talking to
M	HAL (CONT'D)	I'm gay. Jump cut, new outfit. I loved your mother, but, uh... now I want to explore this side. Jump cut, new outfit.
M	HAL (CONT'D)	I don't want to be just theoretically gay, I want to do something about it. New outfit and inflection. ...I want to do something about it... New outfit and inflection. ...I want to do something about it.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	He changed all his clothes.
M	OLIVER V.O. (CONT'D)	He got a boyfriend, Andy, a physical trainer who was also studying for his professional pyrotechnic license. Camera lands on Hal beaming with pride, his arm around Andy
M	ANDY	Since I came out to my father, he never speaks to me. That's why I've been always attracted to older men. Hal and friends laugh warmly at Andy. We cut to live action
M	OLIVER V.O.	He found an out gay priest to guide him spiritually. He saw a therapist for the first time. He joined the Primetimers. Movie night. Los Angeles Pride, and then...
M	OLIVER V.O.	Four years after he came out, he died in this room...
M	OLIVER	Look, its lonely out here, so you'd better learn how to talk with me. Arthur's face looks up at him filled with a dog's love and no
M	ARTHUR SUBTITLE	While I understand up to 150 words - I don't talk. Oliver leans down, pushing his head into Arthur's.
M	OLIVER	I know. I know. Oliver is ushered out of the room. The nurse draws the MOMENTS LATER: Oliver sits with Hal, now off the ventilator
M	OLIVER	Calm. Calm, calm breaths. Hal coughs.
M	HAL	Oliver! Please help me with all these ropes. Oliver rushes and helps him.
M	OLIVER	Pop, Pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself. A NURSE quickly enters and helps hold down his arms.
M	NURSE	Mr. Fields, we're going to have to secure your arms again.
M	HAL	You two married?
M	OLIVER	No, Pop.
M	HAL	Why not? She's great. The nurse smiles, embarrassed, and continues with her job.
M	OLIVER	She's a great nurse in the hospital, we don't really know her, you're very high on drugs.
M	HAL	You always have some very good reason, haven't you?
M	OLIVER	No, Pop, I just don't want to be like you and mom. Thank you... DIFFERENT DAY, IN OLIVER'S BEDROOM: Oliver watches Hal and DIFFERENT DAY, IN PARENT'S BEDROOM: Oliver watches Hal and 10-year-old Oliver studies them each time.
F	GEORGIA	Oliver! He turns and Georgia shoots him with her finger, Oliver falls
F	GEORGIA	Olly, you can do better. He gets up and she shoots him again - He falls more
F	GEORGIA	That's good. His mom looks at him affectionately.
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Go have your own experiences with your own people. I'll be right here... Arthur stays by Oliver's side.
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	I'm a human. I'm not a dog. And you're a Jack Russell, that's a breed. Your personality was created by this guy John Russell, a hunting enthusiast, in the 1800s. And he bred your ancestors to have stamina and courage for the hunt. You think you're just you, and you want to chase the foxes, but other people planted that in you years ago.
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are considered very cute by us humans, and we keep breeding you not to chase foxes, but to be cute, and we put you in movies and television shows, and you, you're chasing tennis balls cause there as close to a fox as you're going to get. Arthur stays by Oliver's side. Reveal that Oliver is in a design office. LIZ, 30's enters, Oliver stops drawing, lost in his thoughts...
M	OLIVER	Want me to read this? I found it in your books.
M	HAL	Yeah, alright. Give me the flashlight. Oliver opens it, they look at a few pages together, photos of
M	OLIVER	Nice.
M	HAL	Oh, that's nice.
M	OLIVER	Oh, Andy brought those for you.
M	HAL	Oh, yeah? Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow
M	HAL	Oh, who did that painting?
M	OLIVER	Well, I don't know. Its just a painting on the wall. Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's
M	HAL	A--, and these?
M	OLIVER	They're just photos, Pop.
M	HAL	But how do they relate to the exhibit?
M	OLIVER	They're just personal photos. They're not art. Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the
M	OLIVER	Uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing.
M	HAL	Well, its beautiful. What is?
M	HAL	Putting the Japanese gardens there. It's just beautiful.
M	ANDY	Hal.
M	HAL	Andy! Andy gets on the bed opposite Oliver. He gives Hal a big kiss
M	ANDY	I brought something for you. Oliver watches from outside the room as Andy excitedly pulls
M	ANDY	We made a recording for you.
M	HAL	Oh, God. Andy pushes play, on the recording we hear Andy's voice:
M	ANDY ON TAPE	This is for our friend Hal Fields. Hal. We love you. We hear voices HOOTING, and then large FIREWORKS, LAUGHTER Oliver watches his father's happiness from a distance. LATER: Oliver get's to his real work, pulling out a few 8X10 Oliver begins to do quick portraits of them based on the
M	OLIVER	Jesus, Liz. Another band that wants portraits.
F	LIZ	Well, at least it pays the rent.
M	OLIVER	You do something decent once, and that's all people ever want.
M	ELLIOTT	Hi Liz. Oliver continues to draw, as Shauna and Elliott try to get
M	ELLIOTT	Oliver?
M	OLIVER	Yeah?
M	ELLIOTT	The pen is not your friend. The paper is not your friend. The party is your friend. We're your friends. Your friends are your friends.
F	SHAUNA	I got the skills... he's got the moves...
M	ELLIOTT	I got the moves... you've got the skills...
M	OLIVER	Arthur, you haven't been invited to this party. You're gonna stay and look after the house. Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur
M	ELLIOTT	You remember when Oliver was funny? And he could actually, like, talk, in complete sentences?
F	SHAUNA	Funny? Funny? I don't think so Fun maybe, but not funny unless, like, serious is funny. Then he's' fucking hilarious. Elliot and Oliver laugh.
F	SHAUNA	But, lovable. You are very lovable.
M	ELLIOTT	Yeah, very lovable.
M	FEMALE PARTIER	So cute, does he do tricks? His name's Arthur - he doesn't do tricks. In the background are a couple dressed as JULIAN and ETHEL
M	PARTIER	No? Arthur, SIT! Arthur promptly sits down. Oliver's totally surprised.
M	PARTIER	He's so cute. Shake! Arthur sticks out his paw. Oliver doesn't like seeing Arthur
M	PARTIER	Oh my god, he's so cute, I want him.
M	OLIVER	Does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around? Maybe give you a sense of power?
M	PARTIER	Oh, you're being a therapist! Freud!
M	OLIVER	Thanks, yeah. Very good. Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man
M	LONG-HAIRED MAN	Well, I didn't ask for this. Who would ask for this? This color. This nose. This cheek, this chin. You know, this is my life. This isn't a story. This isn't a joke... Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally
M	OLIVER	Yeah.
M	LONG-HAIRED MAN	I'm so glad you came, Doc. Just really good to get this stuff off my chest.
M	OLIVER	I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh... for this week. Thank you for coming in. The witch moves on. Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down
M	OLIVER V.O.	Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a break, actually. She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's
M	OLIVER	Well, I guess we should start with your mother. The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver:
M	OLIVER	Well then your father. She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.
M	OLIVER	I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis? She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"
M	OLIVER	That's a physical problem. She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is
M	OLIVER	I was doing such a good job of hiding it. How could you tell? Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES.
M	OLIVER	Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink. You? She smiles and nods.
M	OLIVER	You, stay here, yeah? Oliver moves to-- Elliot and Shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with
M	ELLIOTT	No, its just not a natural color for a chicken.
F	SHAUNA	No.
M	ELLIOTT	And look, you see what happens when you free yourself from the cage, walk away from the factory.
F	SHAUNA	You just have no real color.
M	YOU'RE LIKE--	Oliver slips past, hands Arthur to Elliot. He scoops ice
M	ELLIOTT	Hey, hey. Uh-oh, one. Uh-oh, two.
M	ELLIOTT	Two drinks.
F	SHAUNA	What does that me--, one, two.
M	ELLIOTT	Well that's two, two people.
F	SHAUNA	Two people. A girl and a guy?
M	ELLIOTT	Hopefully.
F	SHAUNA	Yeah, wow, making moves. Oliver leaves Arthur in Elliott's arms.
M	OLIVER	Watch him OK? Oliver begins to leave his drinks. We see his POV of the
M	OLIVER	Hello?
M	HAL	Oliver?
M	OLIVER	Yeah.
M	HAL	I'm not sorry I woke you! I went to Akbar tonight.
M	OLIVER	You did? They had wonderfully loud music. In- sit, in-sit, in-sit. What kind of music is that?
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Probably house music?
M	HAL	"House music."
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	So did you meet anyone? At the packed bar, Hal drinks alone.
M	HAL (V.O.)	Young gay men don't go for older gay men.
M	HAL (V.O.)	You have it easy.
M	OLIVER	Would you like to dance? She happily nods yes. They walk to the dance floor, we think LATER. They dance again, now they're sweaty, the dance
M	OLIVER	Hello... Shes mouths a silent "hi"...
M	OLIVER	Can I give you my number? She pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him.
M	OLIVER	Thanks. As he writes, Oliver spies Arthur sitting in the corner of
M	ARTHUR SUBTITLE	Tell her the darkness is about to drown us unless something drastic happens right now. Oliver looks to her.
M	OLIVER	I feel bad dragging Arthur to the party. I should get home. It was really nice meeting you. She writes on her pad: "Au Revoir" Au revoir. Yeah. He leaves.
M	OLIVER	Hello? ON THE OTHER END: Silence. A little breathing, the party in
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Is that you?
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	One beep means yes?
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	I've always wanted to have a phone call with someone who doesn't talk...
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	You want to do something? Now?
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Okay, I'm parked just right up the street. BEEP. They hang up. Oliver is filled with hope.
M	OLIVER	Okay. You point - I'll drive. Oliver starts the engine. She points forward and they head
M	OLIVER	This way?
M	OLIVER	Nice place. They sit on her bed. She steals his pipe, put's it in her
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Oh, my mother. My mother died five years ago.
F	ANNA	Oh merd.
M	OLIVER	Oh, you spoke. I'm not supposed to. She writes and present him with a new question.
M	OLIVER	My father died two months ago, almost three. She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise. Oliver's
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	He, he was gay. She's very surprised.
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	He was gay the whole time they were married.
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	He came out after my mother died and, uh... he was 75 years old. There's a quiet moment of deep connection.
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Sorry. She mouths "No" (don't say sorry). She reaches out and gently Can we just sleep? Sure, sure. They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning Anna holds up her notebook: "Who are you?"
M	OLIVER	Oliver. She writes again: "Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday."
M	OLIVER	How long are you here when you get back? Anna holds up one finger.
M	OLIVER	A year? Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller.
M	OLIVER	A month? Right. And then?... She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting.
M	OLIVER	You're filming here. Acting.
M	OLIVER	And after?... She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.
M	OLIVER	Just somewhere else. Where? Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on He's very happy.
M	OLIVER	Yes. REPEAT SCENE: Oliver and Anna's first kiss, tentative and
M	OLIVER	Hello house, (Low voice) hello Oliver.
M	OLIVER	Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail. Oliver slows and stares at his father's magazine - The
M	DOCTOR LONG (O.S.)	Hal, its remarkable how well you've recovered from being on the ventilator.
M	HAL	But...?
M	DOCTOR LONG	The bronchoscopy revealed a mass about the size of a quarter. It is located in your lower right lung. CU on Hal taking this in.
M	DOCTOR LONG (CONT'D)	I'm afraid the biopsy showed it's cancerous.
M	HAL	Uh-huh. I see.
M	DOCTOR LONG	It appears to have spread... to the large hilar lymph nodes in your chest and liver. With the already weakened state of your heart and lungs... As Dr. Long talks about treatments, Oliver drifts back from ... Surgery isn't possible given its location. We can start radiation treatments and see if you're strong enough for Chemo. You will be able to go home.
M	SHOT OF 25 PENNIES.	We cut back to Hal's face, stoically digesting the news.
M	DOCTOR LONG	Do you have any questions?
M	HAL	No. Thank you. As the doctor leaves. Oliver takes his father's hand.
M	OLIVER	I'm sorry.
M	HAL	Well, let's not rush out and tell everyone.
M	OLIVER	Andy?
M	HAL	No need to get him up a tree. Hal takes a moment and composes himself. In his eyes we can
M	HAL (CONT'D)	Can you read me something?
M	OLIVER	The Brazilian ballet star is already known not only as a skilled partner, but also as a gifted and versatile dancer, who adeptly fields roles ranging... Camera tracks out of the room, leaving the two men alone... JUMP CUTS: Oliver draws another severed head, then a woman He looks down and pets Arthur, as we hear...
M	OLIVER V.O.	Yeah, he's fine. He sleeps on your bed.
M	HAL	But is he eating?
M	OLIVER	Yeah, yeah, he's eating.
M	HAL	Oh God, I worry so much about-- As Andy enters, his hands mysteriously cupped together.
M	HAL	Oh here we are... Andy shows Hal his cupped hands. What have you got in there?
M	ANDY	A slug.
M	HAL	Oh, Andy, you can't bring that kind of thing in here.
M	ANDY	Oh I can look. Andy flashes open his hands, revealing nothing. He snorts and
M	HAL	Fuck you. Oliver watches with amusement. NURSE SOPHIA enters...
M	HAL	It's time for inspection... The nurse works her way between Andy and Hal to take his
M	NURSE	Hello, Mr. Fields.
M	HAL	Hello. Andy feels interrupted, strangely hurt by the nurse. The
M	ANDY	I'm Andy. Hal's boyfriend
M	NURSE	I'm Sophia. Andy gets more and more upset.
M	ANDY	You know, I have the right to be here as much as anyone else. Hal lovingly cuts him off, trying to ease the tension.
M	HAL	Go take a walk. Calm yourself. Andy walks out, feeling embarrassed and rejected.
M	OLIVER	What was all that?
M	HAL	Oh, Andy hasn't had it easy. Be nice to him. To everyone's surprise, Andy storms back in with a bouquet of
M	HAL	Andy, where did you get these?
M	ANDY	Guys, guys, this is to us. Cheers. A NURSE suddenly enters.
M	STRICT NURSE	Drinking's not allowed in the room. All the guys freeze.
M	HAL	Oh, it's not? She shakes her head no, the party stops, she leaves. Oliver
M	OLIVER	I'm sorry. Moans and complaints from the group.
M	HAL	No, no, no. She's a wonderful nurse. (he pauses a beat, then raises his cup again) Here's to health care. Hal swigs back his wine. They all laugh, grab their cups and
M	EVERYONE	To health care! Hal looks happy, Oliver smiles but can't believe his dad. What did you do with my father? He was so polite.
M	HAL	Oh, I invited him - but he never returns my calls. The guys drink merrily. Someone shoves a cup into Oliver's
M	OLIVER	Two, four, six, eight...
M	ELLIOTT	That's it? That's all you're gonna tell me?
M	OLIVER	I'm gonna meet her at her hotel again. You happy?
M	ELLIOTT	Yeah, I'm very happy. Are you happy? Oliver drops his books on the counter to check out.
M	OLIVER	Here's eight... Turns to Elliot.
M	OLIVER	We haven't actually had a conversation yet, so, you know...
M	ELLIOTT	You're thinking about her all the time.
M	OLIVER	And you know that because?
M	ELLIOTT	Because you're not talking about it. I know you. There's a pause, then the truth.
M	OLIVER	It's true. It's embarrassing. I'm 38 and falling for a girl again... It's like I lost the instructions or I, I never had them... Young Oliver walks up to Georgia.
M	YOUNG OLIVER	Where's Pop?
F	GEORGIA	At the museum.
M	YOUNG OLIVER	Is something wrong with you guys? Georgia is startled, she hides her feelings with humor.
F	GEORGIA	What're you, in the FBI?
M	YOUNG OLIVER	No.
F	GEORGIA	The CIA?
M	YOUNG OLIVER	No.
F	GEORGIA	SLA? (no) PTA? (no) BMW? Oliver sits silently.
F	GEORGIA	There is nothing wrong with me and Pop. Georgia's mask breaks revealing sadness. Oliver can see it,
M	GEORGIA (CONT'D)	C'mon.
F	GEORGIA	When you feel bad, you go into a room and scream - loud as you want, for a minute or two, then it's out of you. It's called catharsis. She opens the door, pushes him inside, and closes the door.
M	OLIVER	I don't feel like screaming... Georgia, never ruffled.
F	GEORGIA	You will...
M	OLIVER	What the fuck is that?
M	ELLIOTT	L-E-IT, Elliot
M	OLIVER	Well, that's ridiculous.
M	ELLIOTT	I know! (Getting his criticism more) You're not very supportive.
M	OLIVER	Well, its just copying something someone did, like, 30 years ago in the Bronx.
M	ELLIOTT	Well yeah. I'm part of a tradition of civil disobedience, something bigger than myself. Oliver can't believe Elliott said that.
M	OLIVER	How does it work?
M	ELLIOTT	Shake it, you have to shake it. Oliver shakes it awkwardly, then sprays across the wall:
M	1985 BUSH FINDS JESUS	Oliver runs back to the car, exhilarated.
M	ELLIOTT	What was that?
M	OLIVER	Historical consciousness... you know, something bigger than myself. Elliott scoffs.
M	OLIVER	Let's do it again. Elliott drives off. Oliver's coming to life. Okay, but when you see her, don't tell her that you painted historical consciousness on the wall... WE SEE: more of Oliver's graffiti on different buildings:
F	ANNA	He's sweet. He misses your Dad. She stops. Gets up, nervous, and walks past Oliver into the
M	OLIVER	Maybe we, we could, um, just talk for a second.
F	ANNA	Right. They awkwardly break apart. Anna goes to a chair, Oliver
F	ANNA	Well, my name is Anna. You're worried you can't trust me because you don't know who I am. I get it. That makes sense to me. She falters, looks at him vulnerably. Oliver abruptly kisses The music carries us, they lie in bed, naked. Anna innocently The music seems to bend and slow down, this continues as we
F	GEORGIA	Oliver, stop it.
M	OLIVER	This music's old.
F	GEORGIA	It's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the Jews. Oliver plops down on the bed, listening to her.
F	GEORGIA	In my next life I'm gonna marry a good hot blooded Jew - someone full of emotion.
M	OLIVER	I'm Jewish right? Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she
M	GEORGIA AT 50	You're a quarter, I'm a half, your father's none. He has the least emotions, You'll have more emotions than him, but I'll have the most emotions. She likes that she has the most emotions. They head out. You get to play chauffeur but just to the bottom of the hill.
F	GEORGIA	You're turning into a wonderful driver. Oliver's proud.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Excuse me Mrs. Fields....
F	GEORGIA	What? You're not allowed to interact with the art?
M	SECURITY GUARD	It's just that...
M	OLIVER	C'mon. Still embarrassed, Oliver takes Georgia's hand and walks her
F	GEORGIA	You too? You like being a good citizen?
M	OLIVER	No.
F	ANNA	Can you toss me my camisole. Oliver throws a sweater.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	No, my camisole. She throws the sweater back at him. Oliver looks around
M	OLIVER	Camisole? Anna laughs.
F	ANNA	You don't know what a camisole is?
M	OLIVER	I was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions. They're both smiling now.
M	OLIVER	They were very frowned upon. So I had to guess. Anna takes this in.
F	ANNA	You can ask me anything.
M	OLIVER	Anything?
M	OLIVER	What's out there? She points.
F	ANNA	That's a tree.
M	OLIVER	Yeah. And cars.
M	OLIVER	Uh-huh.
F	ANNA	Another building like this one.
M	OLIVER	Right.
F	ANNA	People in the building like us. Half of them think things will never work out. The other half believe in magic. It's like a war between them. Oliver smiles. He moves away from the window.
M	OLIVER	How do you know so much about people?
F	ANNA	Oh. Well, you have to learn how to read their faces. She climbs onto his lap, straddles him.
F	ANNA	For example... here is mad. Anna passes her hand across her face, and she's "mad".
F	ANNA	Happy... Her hand passes again and she's "happy".
F	ANNA	Sometimes its just nothing.
M	OLIVER	Oh yeah? She points at her blank face.
F	ANNA	This is nothing... And they are good at looking one way and being another way. Her playfulness is very meaningful to Oliver, he's in love. You don't know me. I like that.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	No, that's not true.
M	ANNA (V.O.)	Oh yeah? Yeah, you have blonde hair that goes down to about here. You smoke in non-smoking rooms. Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain
M	OLIVER	Okay, open your eyes... HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath Oh yeah? You drive on the sidewalk. You were raised by animals. Sometimes you look very alone, like you just got here. They meet up with friends on the banks of the river.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Yeah, you see, you don't know me at all.
M	ARTHUR SUBTITLE	She's unlike any girl I've ever met.
M	OLIVER	Someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it?
M	ARTHUR SUBTITLE	Are we married yet?
M	OLIVER	No, uh, it doesn't work like that. There are other steps, it's complicated. They look at each other a beat and then walk on together.
M	ARTHUR SUBTITLE	I hope this feeling lasts.
M	HAL	What happened with Michelle?
M	OLIVER	You know... I don't know.
M	HAL	She seemed great.
M	OLIVER	She was great.
M	HAL	Maybe you should take out a personal ad, where you explain your situation?
M	OLIVER	My situation?
M	HAL	Yeah, I mean, you want to be in a relationship but you can't stay in one.
M	OLIVER	That's your fatherly advice? Personal ads?
M	HAL	Well, a lot of people use them... I did.
M	OLIVER	What?
M	HAL	If Andy wasn't going to be monogamous, why should I be?
M	OLIVER	Jesus, Pop.
M	HAL	Jesus yourself.
M	HAL	Hello house (Answers back in deep voice) Hello Hal. Andy holds Arthur. Hal and Arthur kiss. They've clearly JUMP CUTS: Oliver takes bottles of pills and syrups and
M	HAL	Oh God, what have you got this time?
M	ANDY	It's a green caterpillar.
M	HAL	No, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar.
M	ANDY	Oh yeah I do.
M	HAL	Oh my God. Gross! Oh, Jesus... Andy puts the caterpillar down on the saucer of Hal's tea
M	HAL	Hey, you going?
M	ANDY	Yeah, Michael's in town.
M	HAL	Oh. Right. Andy waves goodbye and leaves. Hal is sad but covering it
M	OLIVER	I thought he was your boyfriend?
M	HAL	Well, at least I'm the number one boyfriend. Hal grimaces in pain, doubles over.
M	OLIVER	Pop.
M	HAL	Oh, my stomach.
M	OLIVER	Alright, come on. Come on. Oliver tries to clear the couch of books and dogs for Hal to
M	OLIVER	Arthur, down.
M	HAL	Well, let's say, when you were little, you always dreamed of some day getting a lion? Oliver eases Hal down onto the couch. And you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and the lion doesn't come. Then along comes a giraffe. Oliver helps Hal get his feet up.
M	HAL	You can be alone or you can be with the giraffe.
M	OLIVER	I'd wait for the lion. Oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on Hal's face.
M	HAL	That's why I worry about you. Hal looks at Oliver with love and concern.
M	"PAST."	Oliver stops drawing, thinking of a conversation with his
M	HAL	You want me to be with someone like me. I like Andy cause he's not like me... he's fun.
M	OLIVER	Hey, what did you get? She puts the cover of Liv Ullman's "Changing" over her face -
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Liv Ullman. Very serious.
F	ANNA	And I found this crazy book. She holds an old copy of THE JOY OF SEX in front of her face.
M	OLIVER	That's kind of a classic American thing. Anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having
F	ANNA	Maybe we can figure out some classic American things to do. Oliver takes the book and flips through the pages.
M	OLIVER	Yeah, Like page 75?
F	ANNA	Uh-huh.
M	OLIVER	Or 75 all the way through, through Oliver, Anna and Arthur sit at the end of an aisle looking at Louise Brooks, star of silent screen... effectively banned from Hollywood in early Thirties, ended up working as a salesgirl at Saks Fifth Avenue.
M	OLIVER	Veronica Lake.
F	ANNA	Oh I love her.
M	OLIVER	She was a pin-up model and a film star... Success was short-lived... series of broken marriages... She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism. She died of hepatitis at the age of 53.
F	ANNA	All these actor stories end sad. I can tell you that already. It's not a good life. Oliver closes the book, they share a look, and something
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	So. Now I want real Mexican food. She stops on an illustration she likes.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	And I want to try page... 46.
F	ANNA	No.
M	OLIVER	Yeah.
F	ANNA	Really?
M	OLIVER	It's really good. What do you think?
F	ANNA	It's so good. Oliver's so relieved.
M	OLIVER	It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd like it.
F	ANNA	Why?
M	OLIVER	You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel. Anna can barely swallow her huge bite...
F	ANNA	I like this place.
F	ANNA	I used to love hotels. But now I'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere.
M	OLIVER	How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends?
F	ANNA	It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people.
M	OLIVER	You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people. She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine.
F	ANNA	You are like that? Its what you do? Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either
F	ANNA	So we are the same?
M	OLIVER	Yeah, I guess so. The look to each other.
M	OLIVER	Pop?
M	HAL	Oh, did I wake you? Yeah. (Handing Maria some books) Thank you Maria. (to Oliver) And now that you're here, uh, would you please put those up there?
M	OLIVER	What are you--? Pop. What?
M	HAL	I'm reorganizing.
M	OLIVER	Prednisone makes you crazy.
M	HAL	I'm just not sleepy. I feel great.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Pop, you should rest. Hal looks sick but energized, he shuffles his desk of papers.
M	HAL	As soon as I finish these papers. Right, papers? (In a different voice) Right, Hal. As soon as you're done, you can rest. Oliver can only sit and worry.
F	ANNA	What?
M	OLIVER	Nothing, you're pretty.
F	ANNA	No...
M	OLIVER	Yeah.
F	ANNA	Jewish girls are not pretty. They can be "interesting", or cute, but not pretty.
M	OLIVER	You're kidding right?
F	ANNA	That's what my mom told me.
M	OLIVER	She did not. Anna laughs. As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins
F	ANNA	No, you're right, this girl at school told me that. And I went home and my mom said, `Anna, who told you that? And Oliver's narration fades in over them walking... Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003. And when I tell her that my mother was Jewish. And then my father turned in his gay badge when my mother turned in her Jewish badge. And they got married in
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	My mother didn't know she was Jewish until she was 13. It was 1938. This is what people looked like.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	And lions and giraffes. This man was Man of the Year.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Her father tried to hide that they were Jewish. This is the swim team that asked her to leave once they discovered that she was Jewish.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	This is what pretty looked like in My father realized he was gay when he was 13. It was 1938.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	This is what pretty looked like. This is the high school where they first met. This is the war they both went to. And this man was popular when they met again. This is the only place my father could hide and have sex in the Fifties.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	My father said if you got caught my the Vice Squad you could lose everything... This is everything.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	My father laid down on a couch like this and told the psychiatrist all his problems in 1955. The doctor told him that homosexuality was a mental illness, but it could be cured.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Not everyone got cured.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	This is where my parents lived in And this is the home where the first gay rights group was secretly meeting.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	While they were reciting their vows, here in this church...
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Allen Ginsburg was writing his famous poem, Howl, blocks away in this room.
M	ALLEN GINSBERG (V.O.)	Who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy. Who blew and were blown... LATER: the three members of "The Sads" and a RECORD COMPANY
M	RECORD COMPANY LADY	Just do the portrait of them, it's an album cover, right? That's what they want. Yeah? Oliver's very disappointed but polite. Yeah. Right. Oliver and Arthur leave the office, defeated.
M	OLIVER	Here, Pop.
M	HAL	Oh, God.
M	OLIVER	I know, I know. Come on. Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his
M	HAL	Hey, no, no, no. That's the Gay Pride Day stuff. Just leave those.
M	OLIVER	Alright. Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a
M	HAL	And that's for gay book club. You better leave those too.
M	OLIVER	But what about this chair? Is it gay?
M	HAL	The chair's not gay. Obviously. Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord
M	OLIVER	Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that far.
M	HAL	Oh, to hell with it. Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but
M	HAL	Oh, hey what's that?
M	ANDY	Now that you're out of the hospital, you'll have to exercise, get you back into shape. Oliver can't believe it.
M	HAL	That's a great idea.
M	ANDY	Okay, let's try it. I'll, I'll show you how. Hal's still heading to the sink.
M	HAL	Yeah, later on, I'm gonna make myself some tea.
M	ANDY	Okay, I'll clean it up. It's a little - yech. Andy walks out, Hal pours water into a kettle, in front of
M	HAL	Your mother's vase needs some flowers. Oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy...
M	OLIVER	Pop, you just got out of the hospital, you should take it easy.
M	OLIVER	You need to tell Andy that you're... not well. Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver.
M	HAL	You'll tell him, won't you? Oliver's flabbergasted, but his dad's vulnerability is clear
M	OLIVER	Me?
M	HAL	Please?
M	OLIVER	Hey. Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he
M	ANDY	You know that I tried to have sex with women?
M	OLIVER	Yeah?
M	ANDY	Yeah. I wanted you to know I tried, it just, it didn't work.
M	OLIVER	Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys.
M	ANDY	Have you ever had sex with a man?
M	OLIVER	No.
M	ANDY	I heard that if a man hasn't had sex with another man, he's always afraid of gay men. You know, they're a threat. Oliver's blown away by the logic.
M	OLIVER	I don't know Andy.
M	ANDY	I didn't want you to feel threatened, I don't want to have sex with you. What I do, most people wouldn't even call it sex. Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is
M	OLIVER	Okay, okay.
M	ANDY	Hey... Andy gives Oliver a big sweaty hug. Oliver leaves.
M	OLIVER	I couldn't tell him.
M	HAL	That's okay.
M	OLIVER	No it's not. You can't hide this from him. He loves you.
M	HAL	For someone with so much relationship advice, you seem awfully alone. Oliver, angry but at a loss for words, takes the flower vase
M	OLIVER	Just act natural. When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay?
F	ANNA	Don't, don't. It keeps ringing.
F	ANNA	It's my dad. They both watch the phone as it rings and stops.
M	OLIVER	He's that bad? She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I'll be my dad, you be me.
F	ANNA	(In a deep man's voice) Honey? She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of
M	OLIVER	Oui? Anna continues to talk in a different voice.
F	ANNA	C'est toi, cheri?
M	OLIVER	Oui Papa.
F	ANNA	You never call me back.
F	ANNA	You know, I can't stop thinking about, you know, about it. Doing it.
M	OLIVER	Doing what?
F	ANNA	Killing myself. You are the only one I can tell that to. Oliver breaks role, turns around looks at her.
M	OLIVER	You should tell mom about that, not me. She just looks at him. Back into phone.
F	ANNA	You are my girl. They hang up. She's embarrassed, she lightens the mood to get
F	ANNA	Now I have to kill you.
M	OLIVER	Just as it was going so well.
F	ANNA	I know. I'm sorry. She tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him
M	OLIVER	Hey Anna?
F	ANNA	Hey Oliver?
M	OLIVER	How do you feel about vandalism? It's the last question she thought he'd ask. She's amused. I don't know. Pretty okay.
M	ELLIOTT	Oliver, don't write any of that serious stuff, okay? Just write something funny. Girls like funny.
F	SHAUNA	You know what? Here, give me Arthur. We'll just stay here and get arrested. You know, that's good. Oliver leaves Arthur with her, and Anna and Elliott and him
M	OLIVER	You okay?
F	ANNA	Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my new friend (the handrail she holds).
M	OLIVER	Okay. Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard.
M	YOU MAKE ME LAUGH BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY.	He makes his way back. Anna's not where she was, he looks and
F	ANNA	C'est beau ici.
M	OLIVER	Yeah. He comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow.
M	OLIVER	I'm trying to impress you.
F	ANNA	She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow
F	ANNA	It's working. They kiss. MOMENTS LATER. They're at the bottom of the ladder. They all
M	OLIVER	Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry. We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the
M	OLD MAN	Oh. No problem. No problem. What's with this card?
M	OLIVER (CONT'D)	Uh, do you mind? Oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens.
M	OLD MAN	Thank you. He disappears. Oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost. Anna
F	ANNA	He looked like your dad?
M	OLIVER	Yeah. She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed,
M	OLIVER	Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick. 2. Hal arrives at the cookie plate in the Cancer Center 3. CU on the cookie plate.
M	HAL	Oliver, this is Blake. He's a wonderful man. CU of the small round registration tattoos on Hal's chest
M	HAL	Look. I finally got a tattoo. Registration purposes of course.
F	ANNA	Good for him. Oliver continues to tell Anna about Hal. He did a lot of shopping. Bought all these books.
M	OLIVER V.O.	And new clothes.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	He was obsessed with Staples. He bought a lot of plants.
M	OLIVER	He had a lot of parties.
M	HAL	Well, glad you could make it.
M	OLIVER	I thought I was making dinner?
M	HAL	It's movie night. Oliver and Hal make their way through a crowd of Hal's gay
M	PARTY GUEST	Hal, you look wonderful.
M	HAL	Oh, I'm turning the corner on this thing. We loose Hal and Oliver in the group...
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	He had these political letter writing parties, there was an out gay congressman he was supporting...
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	He started telling everyone that he was getting better. They're finally almost alone. Why're you telling them you're "turning the corner"?
M	HAL	Well...
M	OLIVER	You have stage 4 cancer?
M	HAL	It's not as bad as it sounds.
M	OLIVER	Pop. There is no stage 5.
M	HAL	That's not what it means.
M	OLIVER	What does it mean?
M	HAL	It just means it's been through 3 other stages. Oliver doesn't know what to say, he looks through the door at
M	OLIVER	What movie are we watching?
M	HAL	"The Life of Harvey Milk." He was the first openly gay politician...
M	OLIVER	Yeah I know who Harvey Milk is.
M	HAL	Good, good. MOMENTS LATER: Everyone is crowded onto the couches, they're
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	He hired a secretary that he could dictate to.
M	OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	He wrote an essay about religion...
M	HAL	Eventually Jesus grew old. He could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice. One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing. The three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him. After gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, Jesus passed away.
M	OLIVER	You re-wrote Jesus' death? They all laugh.
M	HAL	It was so violent, we need new stories. Oliver goes over and kisses Hal on the head.
M	OLIVER V.O.	For the first time I saw him really in love. Oliver waves back at his father.
M	ANNA V.O.	He sounds amazing. But that must have been crazy for you.
F	ANNA	Stay here. She starts to close the door, Arthur scratches, she tries
M	OLIVER	Anna?
F	ANNA	I couldn't sleep, I wanted to walk around... Oliver's petting Arthur. He's confused and hurt.
F	ANNA	You've lost so much. What if I can't make up for that?
M	OLIVER	If this is too much, then we should just stop. Oliver gets up and starts to leave, Anna's surprised. She
F	ANNA	Wait, wait. She forces him to stay there.
F	ANNA	I don't want to stop. They hold this pose in silence for a beat, then,
M	ANDY	Ready? Andy has a set-up of large fireworks ready to go, Hal and
M	YES!	Mock enthusiasm.
M	OLIVER	No!
M	BOOOM BOOOM BOOOM BOOOM	IT IS INCREDIBLY LOUD. Big fireworks explode, the guys laugh
M	HAL	Again! As Andy lights up some more.
M	BOOOM BOOOM BOOOM BOOOM	Oliver covers his ears, he yells out...
M	FFFFFUUUUCCCCKKKKKK!!!!!!!!	He's still yelling after the explosions stop.
M	FFFFFUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK!!!!!	Oliver's laughing now - the noise, the absurdity. Hal and
M	FFFFFFUUUUUCCCCKKKKK!!!!!	They keep eye contact. They are bonded, happy, out of their
M	EVERYONE	Arthur! Arthur... Arthur...
F	ANNA	Ah, you're awake! Arthur says it's time to get up, he says he has the day off.
M	OLIVER	He talks to you too?
F	ANNA	Yeah.
M	OLIVER	Your English is not so perfect. And he said ten minutes.
M	OLIVER	You okay? (to Anna) You did really well.
M	ELLIOTT	Yeah, I can't believe that was your first time.
M	OLIVER	humans going around and around. The manager of the rink suddenly arrives, upset.
M	MANAGER	Excuse me. There's no dogs allowed in the building. You need to remove him from the premises please.
M	OLIVER	If I leave him on his own, he loses all control.
M	MANAGER	I'm sorry. There's no dogs allowed in the building.
M	OLIVER	Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. I can't leave him in the car.
M	ELLIOTT AND SHAUNA	C'mon, it's her first time! A ca vas! C'est bon!
M	MANAGER	I don't know what she's saying but I don't like it.
M	OLIVER	She is just talking in French. She's saying it's OK, it is such a small dog. You need to remove the dog from the premises or I'm going to have to call the authorities.
M	OLIVER	You're gonna call the authorities?
M	ELLIOTT AND SHAUNA	Fuck it, steal the skates, just leave.
F	ANNA	Dans ce pays! On ne peut pas amener un chien. On peut rien faire. Mais c'est con...
M	OLIVER	Sorry, excuse us, sorry. They enter Anna's door.
M	OLIVER	He shouldn't do this to you. The phone in the next room keeps ringing. He awkwardly skates
F	ANNA	Even if we don't answer, he's still in here (points to her head).I go somewhere else, he's still here. Oliver can relate.
M	OLIVER	Your leaving soon?
F	ANNA	Yeah.
M	OLIVER	I think you should come to my house and move in with me.
F	ANNA	Would you want a strange girl like me?
M	OLIVER	Yeah, a lot. She's very moved.
F	ANNA	Do you cook?
M	OLIVER	Yes (not so sure). She laughs. She almost cries as she thinks this over. She
F	ANNA	I would love that. They kiss.
M	OLIVER	But now I'm going to have to kill you for sure now.
F	ANNA	Why?
M	OLIVER	Cause I'm falling in love with you. The sound in the room fades down, Oliver's narration fades in
M	OLIVER V.O.	Anna and I are in a relationship in This is what the sun looks like and the stars. This is what it looks like when we eat. When we tell each other the stories in our heads.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	I was born in 1965. Anna was born in 1971. This is what the sun looked like. Her pets. Her parents. She left home when she was 16. She lived here and here and here.
M	OLIVER(V.O.)	She had three serious relationships. She left all of them. I had four serious relationships. I left them too. Or let them fall apart.
M	OLVIER (V.O.)	We didn't go to this war. We didn't have to hide to have sex. Our god fortune allowed us to feel a sadness that our parents didn't have time for and a happiness that I never saw with them.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	We didn't know how we learned the stories in our heads but sometimes they stop running and I can really see Anna's eyes in 2003. Her ears. Her feet. This is what it looks like when she says, I love you, in cries. When she tells me there's always a new empty room waiting for her. They used to make her feel free. Now they make her feel the opposite of free.
M	OLIVER	Next one.
M	HAL	Lord. With each swallow he pings a glass with a fork. Hal opens a
M	HAL (CONT'D)	Here, that means gay pride.
M	OLIVER	Yeah, everyone knows that, here. He gives Hal another pill, another reluctant difficult
M	HAL	No they don't.
M	OLIVER	Everyone knows about that Pop.
M	HAL	Don't be ridiculous. Hal's hiding something, he doesn't look Oliver in the eyes
M	HAL	Did you know, about me? Oliver shakes his head no.
M	OLIVER	No, I just thought you and mom weren't in love.
M	HAL	We loved each other.
M	OLIVER	But you were gay that whole time.
M	HAL	I learned how not to be.
M	OLIVER	For 44 years?
M	HAL	I knew I was gay, though, at dinner parties I was looking at the husbands not the wives. I couldn't have survived if I didn't know that. I just chose not to follow those instincts.
M	OLIVER	What about sex? You guys had sex?
M	HAL	She didn't think I was the greatest lover, but we made do. Look, I liked my life, the museum, our house, that's what I wanted.
M	OLIVER	And mom? You wanted mom too right? Frustrated and angry, Oliver takes the pill tray into the
M	HAL	Yes, stop that.
M	HAL	She proposed to me you know. This draws Oliver back into the room.
M	HAL	I said - look I love you and we're great buddies but you know what I am. And then she says, that doesn't matter. I'll fix that. Oliver's never heard this part of the story before.
M	`HAL	I thought. Oh, God. I'll try anything.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Sex.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Life.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Healing.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Sunlight.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Spirit.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	The first Gay Pride flag was made in 1978 by a man named Gilbert Baker. He gave a meaning to each color.
M	OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	This man was President. This was invented, this is what movies looked like. Pets.
M	OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	On November 27th, 1978. Harvey Milk was shot and killed.
M	OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	One week later, my father opened his annual Museum Christmas Exhibit. He collected stuffed animals from people in the community, and put them on display. My father printed a quote from The Velveteen Rabbit in large type on the wall...
M	OLIVER V.O.	...`The stuffed rabbit asked - What is real? And the Horse said, "Real isn't how you're made. It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with, but really loves then you become real...
M	OLVIER (V.O.)	...And the rabbit asked, 'Does it hurt?' And the horse said, 'Sometimes.' 'Does it happen all at once like being wound up, or bit by bit?'...
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	...'It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen to people who break easily... ...Generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints. But these things don't matter at all because you are real and you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.'" The music blares as Arthur greets Oliver. Hal comes to
M	HAL	Andy's moving in.
M	OLIVER	Yeah? Is that a good idea? Hal hugs Oliver.
M	HAL	Just be happy about it. Oliver can't just be happy about it. Reveal a Sads band member looking at the design in disbelief.
M	OLIVER	This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness. Oliver spreads out an impossible long CD panel design.
M	OLIVER	Here, this could be your... The panels go on and on. Your gonna need a big CD box. Four billion years ago, Earth begins. And the idea is that sadness has not been created yet.
M	OLIVER	I'm sorry.
M	RECORD COMPANY REP	I'm sorry too. They shake hands and she leaves.
M	OLIVER	Well, that went well.
M	ARTHUR SUBTITLE	Are we married yet?
M	OLIVER	Come on Arthur.
M	OLIVER	This is the living room. He leads her into the dining room.
M	OLIVER	Dining room. Oliver points to a photo of his parents when they were in
M	OLIVER	There are my parents. My mom. Hal, Georgia, this is Anna - Anna - Hal, Georgia. Anna's overwhelmed feeling increases, she continues to try to
F	ANNA	Hello.
M	OLIVER	These're the stairs.
F	ANNA	Yeah?
M	OLIVER	They go up.
M	OLIVER	I emptied these for you. I'll get your case.
M	OLIVER	Are you okay? She want's to be, she hides it all by initiating sex with
F	ANNA	You OK?
M	OLIVER	Are you?
M	ANNE	I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to bug you. Oliver can't overcome his mistrust of her and the whole
F	ANNA	I was nervous, and excited. I kept thinking, maybe I'm not so lost.
M	OLIVER	Why were you crying yesterday? They're miles apart. REPEAT MEMORY: Young Oliver watches his mother and father go
F	ANNA	You okay?
M	OLIVER	Yeah.
F	ANNA	You seem so unhappy with me.
M	OLIVER	Well are you happy here?
F	ANNA	Maybe I'm not perfect at it. I don't really know what I'm doing... but I want to be here. He's silent, distant, confused. She's hurt by his silence and
M	OLIVER	I don't know Anna. I don't think this is what I am supposed to feel like. Anna looks crushed and surprised.
F	ANNA	Okay. I will go back to New York then. She gets up to go. Hal, you don't need to come in for any more treatments. Stoic and irreverent, Hal feigns surprise.
M	HAL	Have I done something wrong? It's best that you stay home. Hospice can help you more now, any more treatments would just -- cause more pain.
M	HAL	I see.
F	DR. LONG	I'm sorry, I wish we could do more.
M	HAL	You did an excellent job Dr. Long. Thank you... for... For coming to the party. Oliver's devastated.
M	HAL	You always wanted to hold my hand when you were little. I couldn't, you know. I was afraid it would look funny. I wanted to be close, you know and my father certainly was never close with me. God, I hope I wasn't like that.
M	OLIVER	I can barely remember you from when I was little.
M	HAL	I guess I was at work.
M	FANCY WOMAN	Oh! Georgia smiles at her, casually unnerving. Oliver pulls her
M	OLIVER	Let's go home.
F	GEORGIA	What about your father? What will he possibly do without us?
M	OLDER WOMAN	Georgia? You leaving?
F	GEORGIA	Yes Mary, it's an emergency, Oliver's appendix has ruptured.
M	OLDER WOMAN	Oh dear. They look at Oliver who's mortified.
F	GEORGIA	He's a very composed child.
M	OLIVER	Let's go. Oliver pulls her away before she starts any more trouble.
F	GEORGIA	Aha. The infamous left. Up a new street, they arrive at the next stop.
F	GEORGIA	And? Oliver points left.
F	GEORGIA	Left again. Going in circles. I like it. Irreverent but heavy, they drive on.
M	ARTHUR SUBTITLE	We knew it wouldn't work even before we met her. Oliver get's this more than ever. Something changes inside of
M	OLIVER	Anna? Where where you?
M	OLIVER	Hey.
M	ELLIOTT	Hey. You're going to take care of Elliott. I'll be back in a couple of days. Good luck.
M	ELLIOTT	Alright.
M	OLIVER	Okay? Thanks. Elliott closes the door. Oliver heads back to his car and
M	ANDY	He remembers me. It's true, Oliver's surprised. Oliver rings her buzzer, no answers, a stranger leaves the
M	ANNA (V.O.)	Hey.
M	OLIVER	Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm, I'm at your front door. I'm in New York. Anna, still in bed, sits up and feels something.
M	ANNA (V.O.)	I'm in Los Angeles. Oliver's flabbergasted she's not behind the door. You, you're in LA? Anna laughs, but is touched. You said you were coming here?!
F	ANNA	Yeah, but I didn't leave.
M	OLIVER	Fuck. I'm in your building. Anna laughs.
M	ANNA (V.O.)	Okay. See the window? Near the radiator? Oliver looks around and sees the radiator - goes to look.
F	ANNA	There is a hide-a-key behind it.
M	OLIVER	Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like nothing here.
F	ANNA	No. Oliver moves forward into the kitchen.
M	ANNA (V.O.)	This is my kitchen. It's where I eat. Oliver follows her tour, while she's not there, it's This is my bathroom. It's very fancy. The bare, poor bathroom is not fancy. Outside my window... ... That's my neighbor's roof. The room at the end is my bedroom...
M	ANNA (V.O.)	That's my closet. Those are my clothes and my pictures. There is a single rack holding up some clothes. Her pictures
F	ANNA	Why do you leave everyone? Why did you let me go? Oliver thinks for a moment.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Maybe because I, I don't really believe that it's gonna work. And then I make sure it doesn't work.
M	HAL	Isn't Juan's hair wonderful.
M	JUAN	Thanks. I use this great mousse.
M	HAL	Well it's terrific.
M	JUAN	Do you wanna try some? Hal turns shy and young.
M	HAL	Oh, no.
M	JUAN	Just a little bit?
M	HAL	I don't think so.
M	JUAN	Come on. Just try a little bit. It'll be fun. Yeah?
M	JUAN	Yeah.
M	HAL	How do you do it?
M	JUAN	Okay, I'm going to show you how. Juan steps away and grabs his mousse, puts a little in his
M	JUAN	There.
M	HAL	Is that it? Hal looks into camera which is Oliver's POV.
M	HAL	How do I look? Oliver's filled with love, happiness, regret.
M	OLIVER	Great. You look great.
M	JUAN	Oliver. He's gone. Oliver gets up. He can now see to the hospital bed, Hal's Oliver goes to Hal, puts his head on his chest and cries.
M	OLIVER (V.O.)	Once you make the call, you have less than an hour before two men come and place the body into a bag.

M	OLIVER (V.O.)	You will have all their mail forwarded to your address. You will write their obituary. You run it with a photo in the paper for two dollars a word. You will wonder if it's right.

M	OLIVER	I like giving and getting rubdowns and then going into mutual soft stuff. They both smile.
F	ANNA	I have a nice house with food, drinks, friends and me. If you are willing to try an older guy, let's meet and see what happens. She looks at the photo again.
