M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	OLDER MAN	I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt. She was a real peach.
M	WALT	Thanks for coming, Al. Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
M	WALT	Jesus Christ. Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
M	MITCH	Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley. He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
M	STEVE	What do you expect? Dad's still living in the 50s. He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
M	MITCH	Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
M	STEVE	My point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man. It's inevitable. That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it's always something.
M	MITCH	What are we going to do with him? Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood?
M	STEVE	Why don't you have him move in with you?
M	MITCH	Ha ha. Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Death... is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics. Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased ... and their families. Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them. And some may ask, what is death. Is it the end? Or is it the beginning? And what is life? What is this thing we call life?
M	WALT	Jesus. Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
M	STEVE	A lot of people showed up after the service.
M	WALT	Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew there'd be plenty of ham. I think I'll go downstairs and get some more chairs.
M	STEVE	I'll do it, Dad.
M	WALT	Naw, we need them now, not next week.
M	DAVID	Is that Dad?
M	DANIEL	No, it's Grandpa Walt. Josh turns the photo over and reads it...
M	JOSH	Third Platoon, E company, March second, 1952, Korea.'
M	DANIEL	Where's Korea?
M	JOSH	Hell if I know? David holds up a MEDAL.
M	DAVID	Cool, I found a medal. They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs. People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
M	ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)	How long do we have to stay, this ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored. Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
M	MITCH	Ashley, honey. Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
F	ASHLEY	Me?
F	KAREN	Yes you.
F	ASHLEY	Grandpa Walt, can I help you with the chairs.
M	WALT	I'll take care of it, you just painted your nails. Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
M	WALT	I'd better salt the sidewalk before someone falls and breaks a hip. Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very, Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on. Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.
M	WALT	Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can they cram into a living room? Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.
F	ASHLEY	Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car? Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
F	ASHLEY	I never knew you had a cool old car.
M	WALT	It's only been in here since before you were born.
F	ASHLEY	So, what are you like going to do with it like, when... you die? Walt lights up a smoke --
M	WALT	Jesus, Joseph and Mary. Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.
F	ASHLEY	Then what about that super cool retro couch in the den, I'm going to State next year and I don't have, like, any furniture? Walt walks out without commenting. The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
M	WALT	Who the hell are you?
M	TAO	I'm Tao, I live next door.
M	WALT	What?! Speak up, boy, get the shit out of your mouth. What do you want?
M	TAO	Do you have jumper cables? My uncle's car is old and...
M	WALT	No. And have some goddamned respect, zipper head, we're mourning over here. Walt slams the door in Tao's face. Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	How you holding up, Walt?
M	WALT	Mr. Kowalski.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Huh?
M	WALT	It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife and I became quite close these last few months. She asked that I watch over you when she passed on. I told her I watch out for my entire flock, but she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
M	WALT	I appreciate your kindness to my wife and now that you've spoken your piece, why don't you move on to the next sheep? Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession. She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
M	WALT	Is that so?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	It is. Walt drains his lowball glass.
M	WALT	Well, I confess I never much liked church and only went because of the wife. And I confess I have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary. People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling, Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
M	ANOTHER ANGLE	Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
M	MITCH	I'd really like to help, Dad, but we have to get the kids home, they're getting restless. Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
M	WALT	Fine. Go.
M	MITCH	I'll call in a few, see how you're doing. Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.
M	WALT	Kill you to buy American.
M	MITCH	Did you see him look at the truck? It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that. Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
F	KAREN	At least he didn't say anything this time.
M	MITCH	He didn't have to.
F	KAREN	Well, what do you expect? The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years.
M	MITCH	And I suppose that's my goddamned fault? Walt gets his guests' engine running.
M	WALT	Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians. The house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak There's no man in this house, that's why my daughter should remarry. Being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head of the household. It's not our way. What about Tao? What about him? He's the man in the house. Tao's not a man. Look at him in the kitchen, washing dishes like a woman. Even his sister gives him orders and he obeys. The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong Soul Calling ceremony As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow. Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.
M	WALT	I thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers. Christ, I had my own car when I was his age. Tao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off.
M	PAGE 12	A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when -- A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
M	HEAD LATINO	Whatta you gonna do, gook? You gonna Kung Fu' us? Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.
M	LATINO #2	Surprised it ain't a girl's bike. The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.
M	HEAD LATINO	You gonna get up or what? Tao doesn't move.
M	HEAD LATINO	Tell you what, I'll let you take the first swing. You drop me and you can have your bike back. Tao smiles, he can't help it.
M	HEAD LATINO	What the fuck you smiling at, gook? Something funny? He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.
M	HEAD LATINO	You better get the fuck outta here, bitch. He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow. Walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning. Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses. Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped Walt looks down at Daisy --
M	WALT	Damn chinks let their yards go to hell. Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn. Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass.
M	WALT	I don't know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block. This used to be a nice neighborhood. Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking Why doesn't that stupid, hairy white man move? He must be too dumb to realize he's not welcome here. All the Mee-Khah left in the neighborhood should just move away. Look at him strut like a rooster. She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back Daisy snoozes next to the front door. The doorbell Walt looks down at Daisy --
M	WALT	Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf? Walt opens the door. Standing on his front step is
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Hi there, Walt.
M	WALT	Listen, son, you're not my barber, you're not a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Sorry... Mr. Kowalski.
M	WALT	So, what are you peddling now?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Oh, nothing. Thought I'd drop by and see how you were doing. Haven't seen you in church in awhile.
M	WALT	Okay. You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
M	WALT	I don't think so, kid. Sorry.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Why? Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
M	WALT	You don't want to know.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	No, I do.
M	WALT	The problem is I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity. Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovich's face. Tao walks down the street, his head in a book. He The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy
M	LATINO DRIVER	Is you a boy or a girl, I can't tell?
M	LATINO #2	What you reading, gook, Jackass And The Rice Stalk? Tao laughs, but keeps walking.
M	LATINO DRIVER	That's right, you keep walking. Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man. Why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood? Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big
M	SPIDER	Dude, that's my little cousin, Tao.
M	SMOKIE	You sure about that, Spider?
M	SPIDER	I'm sure. Do we do something... or what? Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second.
M	SMOKIE	Your cousin tight with anyone?
M	SPIDER	No, he flies solo, Smokie.
M	SMOKIE	Okay. Let's go help out our little cousin. Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across
M	SMOKIE	You better not be giving my bro here a hard time or you're gonna wish you never been born.
M	LATINO DRIVER	Oh goody, more Rice Niggers. The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
M	LATINO #2	Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go back to your fucking rice paddy. The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs
M	SMOKIE	Where the fuck does he think he's going? Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours. They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with
M	SPIDER	Hey, cuz, slow down, where you going? You should really think about hanging with us, man. If we all stick together, shit like that won't happen, with those Spicks. Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.
M	SPIDER	You can't be such a little girl. You join up with us, we'll keep you out of trouble, cuz. Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong Smokie takes this all in. He looks down the street and
M	SMOKIE	You think about it and we'll see you tomorrow. Tao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits
M	SPIDER	Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.
F	SUE	What do you want?
M	SPIDER	Came to talk to my cousin Tao. Smokie looks over to Sue.
M	SMOKIE	Spider, who's the other cousin? SUE laughs at the name Spider. Sue is seventeen, has
F	SUE	Spider'? Is that what he just called you, Fong?
M	SPIDER	This is my little cousin, Sue. Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.
M	SMOKIE	Hey, Sue... how old are you, girl?
F	SUE	Mentally, I'm way too old for you. I'm going inside.
M	SPIDER	That's right, go inside while the men talk.
F	SUE	Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing, Fong. Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at
M	SPIDER	You think about what we talked about? A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
M	SMOKIE	That's exactly the point, Tao. Spider told me how everyone thinks you're a pushover, how everybody walks all over you and shit. I mean, look at you, out here working in the garden like a woman. Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.
M	SMOKIE	It ain't no big thing. You just need a little guidance. Tao looks up at Smokie. Tao looks a little skeptical.
M	SMOKIE	It's true, man. Shit, I used to be kind of a quiet little punk like you, everybody fucking with me. But finally I said no more.' You, you're lucky, Tao, we got your back. Me? I didn't have nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.
M	SPIDER	Smokie's right. We're family, right? You with us or what?
M	SMOKIE	I swear, brother, we're the best friends you'll ever have. And anyone fucks with you, they're fucked.
M	SPIDER	Come on, man. Tao clears his throat and speaks for the first time.
M	TAO	What do I have to do? Smokie points to Walt's open garage.
M	SMOKIE	Spider mentioned that neighbor of yours.
M	SMOKIE (O.S.)	Now that's a car. Shit ya. 1972 Gran Torino fastback. Cobra jet engine. Mint. Next to the garage, Walt is bent over planting tomatoes. Walt sits at the bar in the VFW (Veterans of Foreign
M	WALT	I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy walk into a bar, the bartender looks up at them and says -- get the fuck out.' The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up
M	FATHER JANOVICH	So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.
M	MEL	Hiya, Father J.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Hi, Mel. Hey there, Darrel.
M	DARREL	Hello, Father.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Hi, Walt. Walt says nothing. He just sips his beer.
M	DARREL	What brings you in here, Father? The meat raffle?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	No. I came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay. Mel and Darrel look at Walt. It puts him on the spot.
M	WALT	I have to hand it to you, Padre. You are persistent.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I promised your wife. Walt looks over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father
M	WALT	Oh Jesus Christ, let's grab a booth. The waitress comes over.
M	WALT	I'll have a Pabst and a shot. What are you having, Father?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'll have a Diet Coke.
M	WALT	Bullshit, this is a bar, what do you want to drink?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Ummmm... I'll have a gin and tonic.
M	WALT	Attaboy. The waitress leaves.
M	WALT	So, what do you want?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
M	WALT	Jesus Christ, why'd you do that?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	She was very insistent. She made me.
M	WALT	You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Let's talk about something else.
M	WALT	Like what?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Life and death.
M	WALT	What would you know about it?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest.
M	WALT	You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school. Everything you say sounds like it's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I don't know about that... Walt waves his hand and cuts him off.
M	WALT	Death is bittersweet? Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.' That's what you know of life and death? Good God, it's pathetic.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
M	WALT	Plenty. I lived with death for three years in Korea. We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ's sake. I did things that won't leave me till the day I die, horrible things, things I have to live with.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	And what about life? Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his
M	WALT	Well... I survived the war... got married... and raised a family.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Sounds like you know more about death than you do living. Walt downs a shot.
M	WALT	Maybe so. Walt hears a sound and wakes up. He's very groggy, he
M	WALT	Daisy? The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint
M	WALT	Son of a bitch. Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip. Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
M	WALT	Shit. Tao scrambles down the alley. Parked off to the side is
M	SPIDER	Get in, get in! Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls
M	SMOKIE	Get in, Tao.
M	TAO	No way. No fucking way. Leave me alone! Smokie, Spider and the other gangbanger grab Tao.
M	SPIDER	I vouched for you, Tao, because you're family and you're with us now. Tao struggles.
M	TAO	He shot at me! I'm out! I'm out!!! Tao squirms out of Smokie's grasp. Smokie yells at Tao
M	SMOKIE	Don't fool yourself, Tao. You don't join us and bail. Dumb motherfucker.
M	SPIDER	Should we go after him?
M	SMOKIE	Naw, he's got nowhere to go. Let's get out of here. Walt drills heavy-gauge screen mesh over the windows on
M	WALT	Hello?
M	MITCH (V.O.)	Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
M	WALT	It's one in the afternoon. The CAMERA now INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt and Mitch in the
M	MITCH	Right, good afternoon, then.
M	WALT	So, what do you want?
M	MITCH	Me? Nothing. What would I want?
M	WALT	I don't know. Your wife already went through all of your mother's jewelry.
M	MITCH	No. I was just wondering how you are, what's going on, anything new in the old neighborhood? Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.
M	WALT	Nope.
M	MITCH	Great. Smooth sailing then?
M	WALT	Yup. There's a very painful pause in the conversation.
M	MITCH	Well good... Say, Dad?
M	WALT	Uh-huh.
M	MITCH	Do you still know that guy from the plant who has Viking season tickets? Walt has parked the Gran Torino at an angle across his Walt fishes out a soft pack of cigarettes and lights one. It's stunning. It absolutely sparkles. The chrome Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood That's right, ain't she pretty. Walt drops down heavily into an old lawn chair and pops Dusk is falling. Walt finally gets up, folds up his lawn Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at
M	SPIDER	Hey, cuz. What's up?
M	TAO	What are you doing here?
M	SPIDER	Be happy. We've got good news.
F	SUE	Oh really? What's that?
M	SMOKIE	We're giving you another shot.
M	TAO	I don't think so.
M	SMOKIE	You blew it the first time. We've got another little inauguration planned for you. This time there'll be no mistakes.
F	SUE	Another big, tough gangbanger with little-man' complex. Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable.
M	SMOKIE	I got my eye on you too, little girl.
F	SUE	Whatever.
M	SMOKIE	Come on, Tao. Let's go. Tao says nothing. He looks at the ground.
M	SPIDER	He said, let's go.
M	SMOKIE	Come on, man. Nobody's gonna get hurt. We'll take care of you.
F	SUE	Don't go, Tao.
M	SMOKIE	You mind your own business, girl. Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms. Leave my grandson alone! I know what you are. Go away and don't come back.
M	SMOKIE	That old woman's got bigger balls than you. You always let little girls and old ladies fight for you? Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair
M	SMOKIE	I'm not gonna say it again. Let's go. Now. Tao is shoved towards the car. Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the
F	SUE	Run, Tao, run! Sue is slapped to the ground. Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard. The gangbangers, Tao, his mother, grandmother and Sue all And before anyone can blink, WALT has the muzzle of his
M	WALT	Get off my lawn.
M	SMOKIE	Listen, old man, you don't want...
M	WALT	I said get off my lawn. Now. Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers.
M	SMOKIE	Are you fucking crazy? Go back in your house, old man.
M	WALT	Get off my lawn.
M	SMOKIE	I'm not fucking around, Gramps. Walt spits out the side of his mouth. He grins.
M	WALT	Don't think for a second I won't blow a big hole in your face and it won't bother me a bit, not any more than if I shot a deer. Now get off my goddamned lawn. Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back. Walt
M	WALT	Believe me, kid, I'll blow your damn head off, go back to bed and sleep like a baby. I couldn't care less.
M	SMOKIE	I'm not gonna warn you again! Walt laughs...
M	WALT	You're nothing to me. In Korea, we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags. Complete silence, there's no sound anywhere in the Walt CLICKS OFF the safety on the M1 Garand Rifle. As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something.
M	SMOKIE	You better watch yourself, old man. The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in A PAUSE. Finally, Sue speaks up...
F	SUE	Thank you. Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground.
M	WALT	I said get off my lawn. We hear a sound outside. Walt grabs his rifle, swings Walt looks around and slowly lowers his rifle. Daisy comes out and stretches on the porch, before
M	WALT	Bad dog. Bad deaf, dumb, blind dog. Walt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash.
M	WALT	No. No more. The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn
M	NEXT DOOR	Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture
M	WALT	Why won't these people leave me alone? Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts
F	SUE	We brought you some shallots to plant in your garden.
M	WALT	I don't want them.
F	SUE	They're perennials, they come back every year.
M	WALT	No. You keep them. Why do you people keep giving me all this garbage? Sue is a little taken aback.
F	SUE	Because... because you saved Tao.
M	WALT	No, I didn't. All I did was get a bunch of jabbering gooks off my lawn.
F	SUE	Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood.
M	WALT	No, I'm not.
F	SUE	Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're bringing you the gifts.
M	WALT	Just take your plant and leave me alone. Walt turns and starts to walk away. Tao's mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to Sue. They look
F	SUE	There's another thing.
M	WALT	What?
F	SUE	This is my mother, Vu, I'm Sue and this is my brother, Tao. We live next door.
M	WALT	So?
F	SUE	Tao is here to apologize. Sue shoots a hard look at Tao, who shifts uncomfortably.
M	TAO	I'm sorry.
M	WALT	For what?
M	TAO	For trying to steal your car. Walt's eyes go wide in recognition. He turns white with
M	WALT	Get this straight, I see you on my property again, you're done. Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house. The doorbell rings. Walt opens it to find Father
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Good afternoon, Walt. Walt's eyes narrow.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I mean, Mr. Kowalski.
M	WALT	I already told you I'm not going to confession.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Why didn't you just call the police?
M	WALT	Pardon?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood. Why didn't you call the police?
M	WALT	Oh, I prayed for them to show up, but guess what? No answer.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	What were you thinking? Someone could have been killed. We're talking life and death here.
M	WALT	Not that it's any of your goddamned business, but when things happen quickly like that, you have to react. In Korea, we never called the police' when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines. We reacted.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski. Walt says nothing.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I've been thinking about our discussion on life and death. About what you said. About how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do. Horrible things that won't leave you. It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden. Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill, killing to save others, killing to save yourself. You're right, those are things I don't know anything about. But I do know about forgiveness. And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them. Stronger men than you. Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace. Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.
M	WALT	I'm impressed. You came with your guns loaded, for once.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Thank you.
M	WALT	You have balls, Father. And what you said, you're right. I'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation. Hallelujah. But there's one thing you're way wrong about.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	What's that, Mr. Kowalski?
M	WALT	The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do. The old, balding BARBER finishes cutting Walt's hair.
M	BARBER	There, you look like a human being again. You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap bastard.
M	WALT	I'm just amazed that you're still alive. I keep hoping you'll die and they'll get someone good in here, but you just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.
M	BARBER	That'll be ten dollars, Walt.
M	WALT	Ten dollars? Jesus Christ, Martin, you keep raising the price. You sure you're not part Jew? Martin the Barber laughs at Walt.
M	BARBER	It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it, you thick-skulled, old Pollack son of a bitch.
M	WALT	Here's ten, keep the change.
M	BARBER	See you in three weeks, you prick.
M	WALT	If you live that long, dipshit. Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out. Walt gets in his old Ford pickup and drives off. This is Sue walks with her ridiculous Wigger (urban white kid) They walk past three BLACK GUYS leaning against a
M	TALL BLACK GUY	Hey, girl, you come over here and talk to me. Come on, baby, don't be shy. Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
M	TALL BLACK GUY	Come on, sweetie, don't be like that. You talk to me, don't be all stuck up and shit.
M	ACROSS THE STREET	Walt waits at a stoplight. He watches Sue and Trey and Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	What are you sposed to be? Trey puts up his hand to hi-five. The Tall Black Guy
M	TREY	Yo, it's cool, dog. What the fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy?
M	TREY	Nothing. We're going to Red Roost to get some CDs. That place is trippin', bro.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	What you call me, you fucking with me, bitch? You think you're funny?
M	TREY	Nothing. No.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	I'm warning you, boy. What you all come up in here for? You here to bring me this present?
M	TREY	Huh?
M	TALL BLACK GUY	This Oriental yummy for me? Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.
F	SUE	Great, another asshole with a fetish for Asian girls. God, it gets so old.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	What's your name, girl?
F	SUE	My name? It's take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.' That's my name.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	You should keep your bitch on a leash, put a choke chain on this whore and yank.
F	SUE	Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus. Call me whore' and bitch' in the same sentence. The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm. Trey moves
M	TALL BLACK GUY	You think you're pretty funny, don't you?
F	SUE	What, are you gonna hit me now? That'd pretty much complete the picture. The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against the wall.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	You don't know when to quit. The old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	What the fuck you looking at, old man?
M	WALT	You... and your buddies. What's the matter with you? Don't any of you work? I see you lazy show- offs in the middle of the day, slowly walking across the street or harassing women. Nobody owes you bastards anything so go out and get a job instead of pushing little girls around, for Christ's sake.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	Why don't you get the fuck out of here, while I'll still let you.
M	BLACK GUY #2	That's right, bitch.
M	WALT	What makes you spooks think you can bully a couple kids with impunity?
M	TALL BLACK GUY	What?! Are you fucking crazy?
M	WALT	Look at me, Slick. You're crazy if you thinking I'm fooling around.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	You are fucking crazy.
M	WALT	You have to be pretty goddamned dumb to think you can push people around without running into someone who will push back. The black guys are a bit dumbfounded. Walt stares them
M	WALT	But you might just be dumb enough not to recognize that your luck just ran out. All bravado drains away from the black guys. Walt is a Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground.
M	TALL BLACK GUY	Fuck this guy. He ain't worth it. The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's...
M	TREY	Man, thanks a lot, mister. Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like
M	WALT	Go home, clown... and pull up your goddamned pants. Walt turns to Sue.
M	WALT	Come on, I'll give you a ride. Walt and Sue drive in silence. Finally Sue speaks up.
F	SUE	So, what's with you, you have some sort of savior complex or something?
M	WALT	What in the hell's the matter with you? I thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart. What are you doing walking around in that neighborhood? That's how you end up in the obituaries, that is, if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river.
F	SUE	I know, I know. Take it easy. Walt looks at her for a second. She's not ruffled at They drive.
M	WALT	So, that goofball back there. He's your boyfriend?
F	SUE	Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey.
M	WALT	Why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that. Why don't you date one of your... own...one of those other... Hu-mungs.
F	SUE	You mean, Hmong? We're Hmong, not Hu-mung.
M	WALT	Right. Hmong. What is a... where is Hmong or whatever? Sue laughs.
F	SUE	Wow! You're so enlightened. Hmong isn't a place, it's a people.
M	PAGE 41	Hmong people come from different parts of Laos and Thailand and China.
M	WALT	Then why are you in my neighborhood, instead of back there?
F	SUE	It's a Vietnam thing. We fought on your side and when America quit, the Communists starting killing the Hmong, so we came over here. Walt is quiet for few seconds.
M	WALT	Why'd you pick the Midwest, for Christ's sake? There's snow on the ground near half the year. Jungle people on the frozen tundra?
F	SUE	Hill people. We were hill people, not jungle people. Boo-ga, boo- ga, boo-ga.
M	WALT	Whatever.
F	SUE	Blame the Lutherans. They brought us here.
M	WALT	Still, you'd think the cold would keep all the assholes away. Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism.
F	SUE	Thanks for the ride.
M	WALT	Sure... You know, you seem okay. What the hell's the matter with your half-wit brother? He a little slow or something?
F	SUE	Tao is actually really bright, he just doesn't know which direction to go in.
M	WALT	Oh, poor Toad.
F	SUE	It's really common. Hmong girls over here fit in better, we adjust. The girls go to college, the boys go to jail. Walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper. He flips
M	WALT	Old hag, giving me the evil eye? Walt opens the paper to the TV guide section and lingers
M	WALT	Aw, what the hell... Walt reads aloud to himself.
M	WALT	Your birthday today; This year you have to make a choice between two life paths. Second chances come your way. Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anti-climax. Your lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and Walt drains his coffee and tosses the paper onto the
M	WALT	What a load of crap. Walt lights up a cigarette and exhales. Three teenagers walk past and laugh at her spilled
M	WALT	Christ all Friday. What's wrong with kids today? Walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the
M	WALT	Well, I'll be damned. Mitch and Karen sit across from Walt. A small store-
M	MITCH	Go ahead, Dad. Open it.
M	WALT	What is it?
M	MITCH	Just open it. Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool --
M	MITCH	It's a Gopher. It's so you can reach stuff. You know, it makes things easier.
F	KAREN	Here's one from me. KAREN slides over a another wrapped gift. Walt opens it.
F	KAREN	It's a phone. Thank you, Karen.
F	KAREN	I just thought... we thought that it would... make things easier.
M	WALT	Yeah, I see that.
F	KAREN	There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself.
M	MITCH	Karen's right, Dad. You've worked hard your whole life. Maybe you should think about taking it a little easier? Walt lights up a cigarette.
M	MITCH	And that's another thing, Dad. You should get rid of the coffin nails. Walt says nothing.
M	MITCH	And the house, now that Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain, let alone clean... and you're all alone in here. It's worse than Walt thought. He puffs smoke.
F	KAREN	There's these great places now, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow. People who are like you, alert, active, but are alone and would benefit by being with other folks their own age.
M	MITCH	Dad, take a look. We brought some pamphlets. Mitch and Karen storm out to their Land Cruiser. Mitch
M	MITCH	I told you, I told you this was a bad idea.
F	KAREN	I know, you were right.
M	MITCH	Son of a bitch! He just won't let anyone help him.
F	KAREN	Well, we tried. Now we can just drop it. No one can say we didn't try.
M	MITCH	To hell with him, kicking us out on his birthday?! We should've stayed home with Ashley and Josh. They knew better, they wouldn't even come. The goddamned kids are smarter than we are! Mitch screeches the tires as they take off. Walt waits Daisy comes out and lies at his feet. Walt continues to sit on his porch, a long row of empty Walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his and Dorothy's
M	WALT	We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy. A vehicle pulls up to Tao's house. A party is in full Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big
F	SUE	Hey, Walt, what are you up to? Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his
F	SUE	We're having a barbecue. You want to come over?
M	WALT	What do you think?
F	SUE	There's tons of food.
M	WALT	I'll bet. Just keep your paws off my dog.
F	SUE	No worries, we only eat cats.
M	WALT	Really?
F	SUE	No, I'm kidding, you moron. Come on, come on over. You can be my special guest.
M	WALT	I'm fine right here. Walt reaches into the cooler for another beer. It's
M	WALT	Son of a bitch.
F	SUE	What have you had to eat today, Walt?
M	WALT	A piece of cake and some beef jerky.
F	SUE	Come on over and get something to eat. We've got beer, too. Walt exhales loudly --
M	WALT	Oh, what the hell. It's my birthday, I may as well drink with strangers instead of myself. Walt gets up and walks with Sue towards her house.
F	SUE	Happy Birthday, Wally.
M	WALT	Don't call me Wally. Inside are thirty Hmong and Walt, who sticks out like a Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his
M	WALT	You do have a lot of beer, but no Pabst.
F	SUE	As they say, When in Hmong.
M	WALT	Ha ha. Are you sure it's okay I'm here? Everyone keeps looking at me and when I look back, they look at the ground.
F	SUE	It's fine. Phong appears from the crowd and points at Walt. You, get out. Out of our house! What is he doing here? Walt cringes at her presence.
M	WALT	What'd she say?
F	SUE	She said welcome to our home.
M	WALT	No she didn't.
F	SUE	No, she didn't. Why is this white man in our home? A man like him brings nothing, nothing but sorrow and death. Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt. The
M	WALT	She hates me.
F	SUE	Yes, she hates you.
M	WALT	What did I do? A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the
M	WALT	What?! What the hell are all you fish heads looking at?! Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room.
F	SUE	Maybe we should go in the other room. Sue explains a few facts to Walt.
F	SUE	A lot of the people in this house are very traditional. Number one, never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child. Hmong people believe that the soul resides in the head, so don't do that.
M	WALT	That's dumb, but fine.
F	SUE	Hmong people also consider looking someone in the eye to be rude. That's why everyone looks away when you look at them.
M	WALT	Swell. Anything else?
F	SUE	Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin when they're yelled at or get into a confrontation. It's a cultural thing. It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, not that they're laughing at you.
M	WALT	Good God, you people are all nuts. Walt opens another beer, as Sue speaks Hmong to a
M	WALT	Hey, Sue.
F	SUE	What?
M	WALT	You said you guys don't look you in the eye, but that guy keeps staring at me. Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man. The Old
F	SUE	This is Kor Khue. He's the Lor family shaman.
M	WALT	Witch doctor? Sue smiles and nods.
F	SUE	Something like that. The Hmong hold their clan Shaman in very high regards.
M	WALT	Boo-ga, boo-ga. Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and
F	SUE	Kor Khue is interested in you, he heard what you did. He says he would like to read you.
M	WALT	Huh?
F	SUE	He wants to read you. Tell you your soul. It'd be rude not to allow him this, it's a great honor.
M	WALT	Tell Kor to be my guest, fire away. Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.
F	SUE	Kor Khue says that you think you've been disrespected. You do not live your life. Your food has no flavor. You are scared of your past. You stopped living years and years ago. Kor Khue says you're not at peace. Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat
M	WALT	Excuse me. Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes
M	WALT	Je -- zuz -- Christ. Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder. Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
F	SUE	Are you okay? Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom. Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands.
M	WALT	Son of a bitch. I've got more in common with these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled-rotten family. Walt looks at himself.
M	WALT	Happy birthday. Walt opens the bathroom door. Sue stands there with a
F	SUE	Are you okay?
M	WALT	Me? I'm fine.
F	SUE	You were bleeding? Walt smiles disarmingly.
M	WALT	I just bit my tongue. I'm fine. I'm great. Let's get some of that gook food, I'm starving. Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food, Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt.
F	SUE	Come on, you glutton, let's go downstairs.
M	WALT	Why?
F	SUE	To mingle.
M	WALT	I'm fine right here. I'm mingling.
F	SUE	Come on, you said not to leave you alone.' Walt and Sue descend the stairway. Walt is really out of
M	WALT	Oh great.
F	SUE	Well, look who's over there.
M	WALT	What's-his-name who tried to steal my Gran Torino.
F	SUE	My brother Tao.
M	WALT	Yeah, Toad. Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks He just can't help it. All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
M	WALT	It was wobbly, but I fixed it. It's fine now, shouldn't wobble anymore. The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from
M	WALT	What's this?
F	SUE	Rice liquor. Try it.
M	WALT	Alright. Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do. She smiles --
M	WA XAM (GIRL)	My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?
M	WALT	Good question. What am I doing here? Anyways, I'm Walt.
M	WA XAM	Hi, Walt. I'm Wa Xam.
M	WALT	Wa Yum?
M	WA XAM	No, Wa Xam. So... what do you do?
M	WALT	Me? Not too much... I fix stuff I guess.
M	WA XAM	Like what?
M	WALT	Well, I fixed my wife's friend's sink yesterday. I drove my aunt to the doctor to straighten out her prescription. Even fixed my screen door before it was broke.
M	WA XAM	You're funny.
M	WALT	That's one thing I've never been accused of. A bastard, yes. Funny, no. Wa Xam laughs.
M	WA XAM	Well, have fun. I'm going to take off.
M	WALT	A pleasure to meet you, Yum Yum. She laughs at Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs.
M	WALT	Relax, zipper head, whatta you think I'm gonna do, shoot you? Tao looks like he wants to run away.
M	WALT	I wouldn't say anything either, if I was you. Walt sips his rice liquor. Walt can't help but rib Tao.
M	WALT	You know, I knew you were a dipshit even before the whole garage deal, but I have to say you're even worse with women than you are stealing cars, Toad.
M	TAO	It's Tao.
M	WALT	What's that?
M	TAO	It's Tao, not Toad. My name is Tao.
M	WALT	Good for you. Anyways, you're blowing it with that girl. Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.
M	TAO	You don't know what you're talking about.
M	WALT	Wrong, egg roll. I completely know what I'm talking about. I know I'm not always the most pleasant person to be around, but I got the greatest woman who ever lived to marry me. I had to work at it, but I got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hands down. Walt points across the room. He sways slightly.
M	WALT	But you? You just sit there and watch as Ding Dong and Click Clack and Charlie Chan walk away with what's-her-face. She likes you, you know.
M	TAO	Who?
M	WALT	She was standing over there, orange dress, twisting her hair and smiling at you.
M	TAO	You mean Wa Xam? Walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods.
M	WALT	Yeah, yeah. Anyways, she likes you, I know, I talked to her. Great girl, charming girl. Love her. I love Yum Yum. But you? You just watch her walk out the door with the Three Stooges. Why? Because you're a big fat pussy! Walt drains his drink.
M	WALT	I gotta go home. Good luck, puss- cake. You need it. Walt empties the lawnmower bag as two elderly Hmong Women
M	WALT	No. No thanks. No more flowers. The elderly Hmong Women nod and speak rapid sentences in
M	WALT	No more. Please, keep your flowers. The Hmong women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring Okay, just put them on the porch. But that's it. No more. The doorbell rings. Walt answers, a Skillsaw in one Standing on his doorstep are three Hmong women.
M	WALT	Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil.
M	WALT	No. Forget it. Stop bringing me stuff. Gee scolds Walt in Hmong.
M	WALT	No. I've had it. Gee opens the corner of the tinfoil. Walt looks at the
M	WALT	I can't. You have to stop. Gee pulls the tinfoil off. Walt gazes at the food.
M	WALT	Is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought the other day? Walt pulls up in his pickup truck. Sue and Vu wait on
M	WALT	What now? What? Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He
F	SUE	Tao is here to make amends, he's here to work for you.
M	WALT	No he's not.
F	SUE	Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt. He'll start tomorrow morning.
M	WALT	No. The kid is useless, I don't even want him on my property. I thought we already went over that.
F	SUE	It's very important to my mother that you accept. It'd be an insult to refuse.
M	WALT	How is this all of a sudden turned around on me? The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow I'm the bad guy if I don't accept?
F	SUE	My family is very traditional and it will very much upset them if you don't let Tao repay... Tao interrupts from the sidewalk...
M	TAO	Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want to, let's just go. Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue
M	SUE/VU	Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!! Tao looks at the ground. A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong
M	WALT	Fine. Great. Tomorrow. Walt walks past them and into his house.
M	WALT	Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers. Walt sits drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Tao
M	WALT	Son of a bitch, I didn't think he'd show. Walt waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt.
M	WALT	Okay. What are you good at?
M	TAO	Like what?
M	WALT	That's what I'm asking. What are you good at? If you're gonna work for me, I have to know what you can do.
M	TAO	I don't know.
M	WALT	That's about what I expected. Okay, why don't you go over by the spruce tree and count how many birds feed at the bird feeder.
M	TAO	Count the birds?
M	WALT	Yeah, you can count? You slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?
M	TAO	Yes, I can count. Tao stands in Walt's garden with his arms folded. Walt
M	TAO	You want me to do that?
M	WALT	No.
M	TAO	Why not?
M	WALT	I want it done right, that's why.
M	TAO	But you've got me just standing here. What am I supposed to be doing, anyway?
M	WALT	Scaring away crows. Tao shoots Walt a dirty look.
M	WALT	It's a perfect job for you, plus you people don't seem to mind squinting in the sun all day. Walt waters a flower bed. Tao comes over and stands
M	TAO	What do you have for me today? You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?
M	WALT	Don't get flip with me, zipper head. I ain't the one who tried to steal and don't forget it.
M	TAO	Go ahead. I don't care if you insult me and say racist things. I'll take it.
M	WALT	That I know. You have no teeth, kid. That's your problem. You have no balls.
M	TAO	Look, I'm stuck here. Why don't you give me something useful to do.
M	WALT	Because unlike you I'm not useless. I maintain my property, whereas you swamp rats let your houses go to hell. Walt looks across the street at one very dilapidated
M	WALT	Wait a minute... How long do I have you for? Tao pauses... he doesn't want to answer.
M	WALT	How long, Toad? Till next Friday. Walt laughs out loud. It makes Tao cringe.
M	WALT	Go get my ladder out of the garage. Tao is at the top of the LADDER. Walt and the Hmong
M	WALT	When you're done caulking the siding, nail that gutter back up, I can see it right out my kitchen window, it's been bugging me for three years. The neighbor says something in Hmong to Walt.
M	WALT	You said it, brother. Tao digs up a big TREE STUMP out in the rain. It's hard, We see Tao do various chores; scrape paint, hang screen Walt watches with great satisfaction as Tao paints one of Walt sips his coffee with a slight grin. He is really, A very old Hmong man and his very young GRANDSON walk up
M	GRANDSON	Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch? Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad.
M	WALT	I don't see why not. Tell him sometime after lunch. Tao walks up the sidewalk. Before ringing the doorbell, Tao rubs his hands with a smile. This has been the first Walt stands over the sink, coughing. In the b.g. the Walt coughs up a big spot of blood, it's thick with Walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink. Walt answers the door, just as Tao rings the doorbell a
M	WALT	Jesus Lord almighty, knock it off.
M	TAO	It's my last day, whatta you want me to do?
M	WALT	Take the day off, you've done enough.
M	PAGE 64	Tao looks disappointed, but says nothing. He nods and
M	WALT	Toad. Tao turns around. Walt wants to say something, but
M	WALT	Nothing, never mind. Walt shuts the door. Walt sits in the crowded waiting room. He looks around. As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez, Finally when the name Kowalski is called, the Muslim Walt sits in a chair, his hands folded in his lap.
M	ASIAN DOCTOR	Mr. Kowalski?
M	WALT	That's right.
M	ASIAN DOCTOR	Good afternoon. I looked over your paperwork and I think we should immediately start on a full battery of tests. I feel that this...
M	WALT	Wait a minute. Where's my regular doctor, where's Dr. Fellman?
M	ASIAN DOCTOR	Dr. Fellman retired three years ago. I'm his replacement, Dr. Chang.
M	WALT	Jesus Christ. Mitch, Karen and Ashley are in the kitchen. The phone
F	ASHLEY	It's Grandpa Walt.
F	KAREN	Well, pick it up.
F	ASHLEY	You talk to him.
F	KAREN	Mitch?
M	MITCH	I'm doing bills here.
F	KAREN	He's your father. Ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the TALK button.
M	MITCH	Hello, Dad. Hello? It's me... Dad.
M	MITCH	I know. What's up? The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Mitch in his huge kitchen
M	WALT	Um... not much, how about you?
M	MITCH	I'm fine, fine.
M	WALT	Fine. That's fine... How about the kids and Karen?
M	MITCH	Everyone is fine.
M	WALT	Good. There is a long, uncomfortable pause. Walt looks at some
M	MITCH	Good.
M	WALT	Well, that's good... How's... work?
M	MITCH	Busy.
M	WALT	Right. I s'pose.
M	MITCH	Speaking of busy, I have a lot on my plate right now, unless there's something pressing. Walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet. Mitch looks at his
M	WALT	No. Nope. Another pause.
M	WALT	Okay then.
M	MITCH	Okay. Yeah, so it's not a good time right now. Why don't you call me over the weekend.
M	WALT	Sure.
M	MITCH	Okay, it was nice talking to you, bye, Dad. Walt hangs up. He lies down on his bed. While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
M	WALT	Hey, moron. Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.
M	TAO	What?
M	WALT	I appreciate you're doing something on your own, but you're the only person I know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches.
M	TAO	What now?
M	WALT	You don't stand on the top step of a ladder and if you cut through that branch you're hacking away at, you'll end up kaput. Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
M	WALT	Go grab the extension ladder from my garage and I'll show you how to do it right, zipper head. Tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs. Walt lights a
M	WALT	Looks good. Good job. Tao nods.
M	WALT	Make sure you put the ladder back when you're done raking up the leaves.
M	TAO	I know. I will. Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.
M	WALT	This kid doesn't have a chance. The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens. Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole The doorbell rings. Walt opens his door. Tao stands there with his hands in
M	TAO	What do you know about faucets? Walt stares at him for a second and then laughs. Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it
M	WALT	For the love of Pete.
M	TAO	What?
M	WALT	It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan. Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles The CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the
M	TAO	Man, where did you get all this stuff?
M	WALT	What are you talking about?
M	TAO	All the tools and stuff.
M	WALT	Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad? This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I have with money I earned.
M	TAO	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what I meant. There's just so much shit packed in here.
M	WALT	You need the right tool for the right job. Every single thing here has a purpose.
M	TAO	Okay, what's this? Tao points to a tool.
M	WALT	Post hole digger. Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
M	WALT	Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife. Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile spacers. Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but
M	WALT	What?
M	TAO	I can't afford to buy all this stuff.
M	WALT	I didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead. I've lived here for fifty years. A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools.
M	TAO	Yeah, but...
M	WALT	Look, kid, I think I know where you're going with this. You don't need everything to maintain a house. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
M	WALT	This is for you. Roll of duct tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips. Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things. In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something.
M	TAO	Okay. Cool. Walt coughs and covers his mouth. Both Tao and Walt see
M	TAO	What's with that?
M	WALT	What's with what?
M	TAO	The blood you just coughed up. That's not good, you should see a doctor. Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the
M	WALT	So... what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night? Who are they?
M	TAO	A gang. Hmong gangbangers.
M	WALT	I gathered that. What did they want with you?
M	TAO	They wanted to take me away because I blew my first initiation.
M	WALT	You joined up with those pukes? Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the hell did you do that?
M	TAO	I don't know. They were persuasive. My cousin's in the gang. They just talked me into it I guess.
M	WALT	Well, at least you're honest about it. A LONG SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.
M	WALT	So how'd you blow your first initiation? Tao nods towards the GRAN TORINO.
M	WALT	The Gran Torino? Tao nods. Walt laughs.
M	WALT	Christ all Friday. Walt straps an old WESTINGHOUSE FREEZER onto a two- Walt strains with the heavy appliance. It's too much Walt could have done this by himself when he was younger. Mitch watches afternoon baseball, drinking an imported,
F	KAREN	See you later, I'm taking the kids to the mall. Mitch never looks up from the TV.
M	MITCH	Yeah, fine. Just don't spend too much goddamned money.
F	KAREN	I will. We hear Karen and the kids exit.
M	MITCH	Thank God. Finally get the house to myself for once. The PHONE RINGS. Mitch looks at the Caller ID. It says;
M	MITCH	Hello. Hello? It's me, Dad... Walt.
M	MITCH	Hey, Dad. What's up? The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt in his small kitchen
M	WALT	Well... I... um... I'm getting the old Westinghouse up out of the basement. Mitch mouths the word Shit.
M	MITCH	Uh-huh.
M	WALT	So... I got it on the dolly.
M	MITCH	Yeah, that'll help.
M	WALT	Yeah... And it's a bit heavy... for one guy.
M	MITCH	Uh-huh.
M	WALT	Yeah... I need a hand.
M	MITCH	Oh.
M	WALT	So are you busy?
M	MITCH	second? It's been down there for years.
M	WALT	Well... Yeah, I'd like to get on it.
M	MITCH	Does it work? We were thinking about getting a freezer. What are you going to do with it?
M	WALT	Giving it to Aunt Mary.
M	MITCH	Oh... Can't she give you a hand?
M	WALT	She's eighty-one.
M	MITCH	I know, I was joking... What does she need it for?
M	WALT	To freeze food. Mitch opens another beer.
M	MITCH	Yeah, well, I'd love to help you out, Dad, but I'm just walking out the door. I have to bring the kids to the mall. Sorry.
M	WALT	Uh-huh.
M	MITCH	Why don't you call Stevie?
M	WALT	Your brother lives out of state.
M	MITCH	Well, I don't know what to tell you, I'm on my way out. Keys in my hand.
M	WALT	Okay then.
M	MITCH	If you can't find anyone by next week, give me a call. Walt nods and hangs up. Mitch hangs up and takes a sip of beer.
M	MITCH	Aunt Mary. Like she needs a freezer. The doorbell rings and Tao opens the door. There stands
M	WALT	You got a minute, Toad? Walt and Tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly.
M	WALT	I just need a little push. All the weight is up top, so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step.
M	TAO	Let me take the top.
M	WALT	Naw, I got it.
M	TAO	No really, I'll take the top. It looks pretty heavy.
M	WALT	I'm not crippled. I got it.
M	TAO	If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping. I'll go home.
M	WALT	Listen, zipper head, now's not the time to go and...
M	TAO	You listen, old man. You came and got me because you needed help, so let me help you. Either it's top or I'm out of here. Walt studies Tao for a second. Tao doesn't blink, he
M	WALT	Okay then, be my guest. Just don't let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me. Tao laughs.
M	TAO	Don't give me any ideas. Tao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and
M	TAO	That thing weighs a ton.
M	WALT	Yeah, but it runs like new. They don't make them like that anymore.
M	TAO	What are you going to do with it?
M	WALT	Sell it. I haven't used it in years and it was always in the way down there.
M	TAO	How much?
M	WALT	Oh, I don't know. Sixty bucks, maybe. Why, you need a freezer? Our downstairs one died. Walt thinks for a second.
M	WALT	Twenty-five and it's yours.
M	TAO	Twenty-five? You just said sixty?
M	WALT	Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper. Walt and Sue sit eating Laab as they watch Tao, who
F	SUE	Kind of ironic, huh?
M	WALT	What?
F	SUE	What the hell do you think I'm referring to? Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you.
M	WALT	It seems like justice to me. And if he misses a spot, he's doing it all over.
F	SUE	after him like this. He doesn't have any real role models in his life.
M	WALT	I ain't a role model.
F	SUE	You're a good man, Wally. I wish our dad would have been more like you.
M	WALT	Don't call me Wally.
F	SUE	No, I'm serious. He was hard on us, really traditional, really old school.
M	WALT	I'm old school.
F	SUE	Yeah, but you're American.
M	WALT	What's that supposed to mean? Sue shrugs him off. They look at Tao for awhile.
F	SUE	You like him, don't you?
M	WALT	Him? Don't be crazy. He tried to steal my car.
F	SUE	And you spend time with him and you teach him how to fix things and you saved him from that fuck cousin of ours and...
M	WALT	Hey. Watch the language.
F	SUE	And you're a good man.
M	WALT	Hand me a beer, Dragon Lady. Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top.
M	WALT	So tell me the problem with Hmong boys again. I'm not completely clear.
F	SUE	Hmong girls slip in and out of the culture more easily. Date who we want, stay close to our mothers, but are able to keep a foot on each side of the fence. The boys fall through the cracks.
M	WALT	Why?
F	SUE	It's tough. The boys float around. The fathers belong in a totally different world and the boys have no one to turn to. Does that make sense?
M	WALT	Not sure. No.
F	SUE	The boys don't ask their fathers for advice, because over here, their fathers no longer have the answers. Hmong boys become almost invisible, they end up banding together and it all goes to hell from there.
M	WALT	The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.
F	SUE	It's more common than not. Walt reflects on this for awhile, then changes the
M	WALT	You still going out with that clown?
F	SUE	No. I dumped him. He was a dim- wit. Walt nods.
M	WALT	Good girl. Walt and Tao spread mulch around Walt's vegetable plants.
M	TAO	You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.
M	WALT	Is that why I see you out in your garden all the time? Besides, zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong.
M	TAO	Funny. Walt lights a cigarette.
M	TAO	You should quit those. It's bad for you.
M	WALT	So is joining a gang, you dipshit.
M	TAO	Seriously, you should quit, I saw you cough up blood.
M	WALT	So, you ever think about what you want to do with your life?
M	TAO	I don't know.
M	WALT	You've never thought about it?
M	TAO	Of course I have.
M	WALT	Well, while you're thinking about it, try not to stomp all over my chives, you dipshit. Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's
M	TAO	Sorry.
M	WALT	Put some mulch around the cucumbers. Tao spreads more mulch.
M	TAO	I was thinking about sales, maybe.
M	WALT	My oldest son's a salesman. He sells cars.
M	TAO	Does he do well?
M	WALT	License to steal. I worked in a Ford plant for thirty years and my son sells goddamned Japanese cars.
M	TAO	You made cars?
M	WALT	That's right. And I put the steering column in the Gran Torino when it rolled down the line in
M	TAO	Wow, that's cool.
M	WALT	It is, isn't it?
M	TAO	Does your son come over much?
M	WALT	How are you going about getting into sales? You thinking about school?
M	TAO	Kinda.
M	WALT	Well, you should.
M	TAO	School costs money.
M	WALT	Maybe you should get a job and save instead of spreading mulch in my garden.
M	TAO	Maybe you could just pay me.
M	WALT	That's funny.
M	TAO	What kind of job could I get?
M	WALT	Good question. Who the hell would hire you? Yeah, I know.
M	WALT	Aw, go on. I'm kidding. You could get a job, easy.
M	TAO	Like what?
M	WALT	I'd think about construction.
M	TAO	Me? Construction? What, do you have Alzheimer's or something?
M	WALT	Naw, you could hack it. You just need a little adjustment.
M	TAO	You said yourself I'm worthless and I have soft little girl hands.
M	WALT	That's exactly the point. I know some guys in the trades, but you have to get your shit together. We have to man you up a bit.
M	TAO	Man me up?
M	WALT	Yes. And you should ask out Yum Yum too. Walt and Tao walk up to the barbershop.
M	WALT	You have to learn how guys talk. Now watch how me and Martin communicate. We just throw it back and forth. You ready?
M	TAO	Sure.
M	WALT	Okay, let's go in. Walt holds the door for Tao and they enter. The Barber
M	BARBER	Oh great, a Pollack and a chink.
M	WALT	Italian prick.
M	BARBER	Walt, you cheap asshole, I should have known you'd come in, I was having such a pleasant day.
M	WALT	Why, did you jew some blind man out of a few bucks, give him the wrong change? Walt and the Barber shake hands warmly. Tao is wide-
M	BARBER	Who's the Nip?
M	WALT	This is Tao. He's a pussy kid who lives next door and I'm trying to man him up a little. Walt points at Tao.
M	WALT	Did you see? That's how men talk to each other.
M	TAO	They do?
M	BARBER	What, do you have shit in your ears?
M	WALT	Okay. You go out, come back in and give it a try.
M	TAO	Come on, Walt.
M	WALT	I said go out there, come back in and talk to the barber like a man. Do it. Tao shrugs, goes outside, lets the door shut then comes
M	TAO	Wus up, you old Italian prick? The Barber levels a sawed-off SHOTGUN at Tao.
M	BARBER	Get outta my shop before I blow your head off, you long-haired faggy little gook! Tao is terrified, frozen stiff. Walt and the Barber throw their heads back and laugh.
M	WALT	Jesus Christ, Toad, you don't walk in and insult a guy. What are you, an idiot?
M	TAO	But... but that's what you said. That's what you said men say.
M	WALT	Not if you never met the guy. If you say that shit to the wrong stranger, they'll blow your goddamned gook head off! Walt and the Barber laugh again.
M	TAO	What should I have said?
M	WALT	Anything but that.
M	BARBER	Kid, you shoulda just started with Hi' or Hello.'
M	WALT	Right. You should have said, Excuse me, I'm looking for a haircut if you have time.'
M	BARBER	Yeah. Be polite, but don't kiss ass.
M	WALT	Or, even better is act like you just got off a construction job. Or bitch about your girlfriend or getting your car fixed.
M	BARBER	Right. Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed and those sons a bitches really nailed me. Screwed me right in the ass.
M	WALT	Exactly. Don't swear at the guy you're talking to, swear about another guy who ain't there. My son of a bitch prick fucking boss made me work overtime and he knew I had bowling tonight.
M	BARBER	Or, my old lady bitches to me for two fucking hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the goddamned game, she starts crying how we never talk.
M	WALT	See? You come back in, Toad. Be polite and then you bring up something you can both talk about. It ain't rocket science.
M	TAO	Yeah, but I don't have a job or a car or a girlfriend. Walt and the Barber laugh.
M	BARBER	Sweet Jesus, I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance.
M	WALT	Just go back outside and try it again. And don't mention you're a pussy with no car, girl, job, future or whatever. Come in and act like a man, Toad. Tao goes out, turns around and comes back in.
M	TAO	Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut, if you ain't too busy... you Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber. Walt and the Barber laugh...
M	TAO	Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job. Walt and the Barber laugh harder.
M	WALT	If you do this, you're going to follow through, right?
M	TAO	Yeah, yeah.
M	WALT	No, not yeah, yeah. Yes, as in yes, sir, I'll do my best.
M	TAO	Yes, I'll do my best.
M	WALT	You better, because when I vouch for someone, it's my word and I don't want anyone making me look bad.
M	TAO	No, I'm good. I'm totally into this.
M	WALT	And don't lay down to people all the time. Always look a person in the eye. When you shake a man's hand, you can usually tell where you stand with him. Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK GLOVES to Tao.
M	WALT	Here, stuff these in your back pocket.
M	TAO	Cool.
M	WALT	Just don't blow this. Walt and Tao walk up to the Superintendent's Office Walt and Tao come in. Walt shakes hands with TIM
M	WALT	Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon, how the hell are ya?
M	KENNEDY	Shitty, but who's gonna listen?
M	WALT	Not me. Walt pours himself a cup of the bad job-site coffee.
M	KENNEDY	Help yourself, Walt, you dumb Pollack.
M	WALT	I already did. This is the kid I told you about. Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he's the super on the job. Kennedy looks Tao up and down. Tao looks him in the eye.
M	KENNEDY	What do we got, Walt?
M	WALT	He's done construction here and there. Whatever you need, he'll pick it up quick.
M	KENNEDY	You sure?
M	WALT	Sure.
M	KENNEDY	You speak English?
M	TAO	Yes, sir.
M	KENNEDY	You born here?
M	TAO	You bet.
M	KENNEDY	You got a vehicle? I see Walt drove you here.
M	TAO	Not at the moment. I'm taking the bus for now.
M	KENNEDY	The bus? Jesus Christ, you don't have a car? My headgasket cracked and the goddamned prick at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100.
M	KENNEDY	I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.
M	TAO	Goddamned thieves. It ain't right.
M	KENNEDY	You got that right. Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do. Tao puts out his hand to shake.
M	TAO	Thanks, Mr. Kennedy. Tim Kennedy shakes Tao's hand.
M	KENNEDY	It's Tim. What's your name again?
M	TAO	Tao.
M	KENNEDY	Okay. You owe me one, Walt.
M	WALT	I'll send you a fucking fruitcake at Christmas.
M	KENNEDY	Fuck the fruitcake, why don't you hand over the keys to that Gran Torino.
M	WALT	Yeah, everybody seems to want that car.
M	KENNEDY	I bet.
M	WALT	You don't know the half of it. Come on, zipper head, let's let this big Mick get back to screwing off. Walt and Tao exit and walk back to the truck. Walt pulls into a Home Depot parking lot.
M	TAO	What are we doing?
M	WALT	What are you gonna put all your tools in, an empty rice bag? Walt and Tao walk the aisles. Walt grabs a tool belt and
M	WALT	You'll need this. Walt then tosses Tao a utility knife holder.
M	WALT	And you'll need that. Now where the hell do they hide the hardware holders?
M	TAO	I can't afford any of this.
M	WALT	I'll get it, but you're paying me back with your first check.
M	TAO	Cool. Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao.
M	WALT	And you need this too. That should about do it.
M	TAO	Not to bitch, but won't I be needing some tools?
M	WALT	Tools I got, but I ain't loaning you my tool belt. You can buy tools as you go.
M	TAO	I appreciate all this.
M	WALT	Aw, forget it.
M	TAO	No, I really do. Thank you. Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the It's really quite a moment for both of them. Tao gets off the bus, his tool belt over his shoulder. The tricked-out Honda pulls up and stops. Smokie, Spider
M	TAO	What now?
M	SPIDER	Just seeing what you're up to, cuz.
M	TAO	I'm getting home from work, not that you guys would know much about that.
M	SPIDER	So it's true? You got a job.
M	TAO	Come on, what do you guys want with me?
M	SMOKIE	Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you think? I've been sooooo easy on you, but I can't just go on like nothing happened.
M	TAO	You can't just leave me alone?
M	SMOKIE	Afraid not. The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as
M	TAO	Keep your hands off my stuff.
M	SMOKIE	Your stuff? You and everything you have is mine. I own you. Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it
M	SMOKIE	You can't just walk away from us, Tao. It looks bad. It makes me look bad. Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales...
M	SMOKIE	What's the phrase I'm looking for? Oh yeah, I need to save face.' Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit Tao screams as his flesh burns. Walt spots Tao as he takes out the trash.
M	WALT	Hey there. Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction.
M	TAO	Hey, I gotta run.
M	WALT	Wait a minute. Where have you been, I haven't seen you in days?
M	TAO	Busy. Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao looks away.
M	WALT	What in the hell happened to you?
M	TAO	Don't worry about it.
M	WALT	Don't worry about it? Look at your goddamned face!
M	TAO	I said don't worry about it. It's not your problem. Walt looks at the ground and spits.
M	WALT	When?
M	TAO	Couple days ago. Grabbed me after I got off the bus coming home from work.
M	WALT	Cowards.
M	TAO	I did everything I could possibly do. They broke some of your tools. I'll replace them.
M	WALT	Forget the tools. Where does your cousin live?
M	TAO	No, Walt, I can manage. I don't want you doing anything. Walt is angry, but eventually nods at Tao.
M	WALT	Alright. You need any other tools for work?
M	TAO	I could use a roofing hammer.
M	WALT	Go in the garage and get whatever you need. Tao leans over his desk with a black Sharpie marker. He Walt sits in the dark, the only light is from the radio Walt watches as Spider and another Hmong gangbanger step
M	WALT	That's the last of them. Walt pulls out his Colt .45 automatic and chambers a Walt pounds loudly on the door. A moment later the door
M	SMOKIE (O.S.)	What the hell did... Walt kicks open the door and grabs Smokie by the collar.
M	SMOKIE	How the fuck did you get here?!
M	WALT	You aren't that hard to track down. Walt boots him again. Smokie curls up in the fetal
M	SMOKIE	What do you want? Walt kicks him a second time.
M	WALT	I came to give you a chance. SOMETHING comes out of the shadows under the porch. It's a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie exhales.
M	WALT	It's just you and me. Nobody knows or has to know I was here. You lay off Tao. Tell your guys he ain't worth it or whatever the hell you want. You don't talk to him, you don't go near him. This is your one chance. You lay off and no one will ever be the wiser. Smokie says nothing.
M	WALT	I'll take that as a yes. I don't want to come back here. But if I do, believe me, it'll be goddamned ugly. Walt kicks Smokie again and stalks off into the dark. Walt pulls up his driveway and parks. Daisy jumps out Walt gets to the door and drops his keys. When he bends Walt groans as he goes inside. He's feeling his age. Vu, Sue, Tao and Wa Xam all sit in lawn chairs, talking
M	WALT	How do you want your dog... I mean steaks cooked? Medium, medium well?
M	TAO	Funny. Walt pops open a beer and grabs an appetizer that Vu
M	WALT	Is this Hmoog or Laab?
F	SUE	Laab.
M	WALT	Isn't it usually a little spicier? Tao, Wa Xam and Sue laugh.
F	SUE	Oh whatever, Wally.
M	WALT	It does. Usually it's got more zing.
F	SUE	Jesus Christ, look at you. I've never seen you like this.
M	WALT	What?
F	SUE	Look at you smile, old man. Kicking back, having a good old time. You're sure pleased with yourself today.
M	TAO	And it's a little unnerving if you ask me.
M	WALT	Aw, go on.
F	SUE	No, admit it. You are. You're feeling pretty good, aren't you?
M	WALT	Well, who wouldn't? I'm surrounded by beautiful women, it's a beautiful day. Great food, good friends. Hell, even Toad isn't driving me nuts for once.
M	TAO	It never ends.
M	WALT	I'm just kidding. Let me tell you something, Yum-Yum. If Tao doesn't ask you out soon, I will.
F	SUE	Don't listen to him, Wa Xam. He's a white devil. I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
M	WALT	I'll be damned. Movie? Dinner? Wa Xam and Tao nod. They're a bit embarrassed.
F	SUE	Yeah, they're taking the bus.
M	WALT	The bus?! That's no good. A charming young lady like this deserves to go in style.
M	TAO	Like what? Take a limo? Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO.
M	TAO	The Gran Torino? You'd let me drive it?
M	WALT	Sure. Why not.
M	TAO	Really? Walt smiles.
M	WALT	Really. They shake hands. Walt watches baseball. He hears a car outside. Shouts Walt gets up and looks out the shades... Walt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds.
M	WALT	Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit? Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao? Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his
M	WALT	Oh no. Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt. What... what is it?
M	WALT	Hang on... you're just cut, is all.
M	TAO	Is everybody else okay?
M	WALT	Yeah. Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in the walls. Tao
M	TAO	It's a miracle no one was killed.
M	WALT	They aimed high. Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head
M	WALT	Where's Sue?
M	TAO	She went to our aunt's.
M	WALT	Call her.
M	TAO	What?
M	WALT	I said call her. Get the goddamned phone and call and see if she's there. Tao scrambles for the phone and dials. Walt sits across from Tao, drinking rice liquor. Walt
M	WALT	This is exactly what I didn't want. Damn gooks. Why the hell am I even here?
M	TAO	Maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans. Walt sips the rice liquor. Walt now speaks quietly to
M	WALT	In Korea I learned not to care. The best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea. You harden yourself. Don't let anything get to you. Phong looks out the window and screams. She runs over Everyone expects the worst... And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt. Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at Walt staggers across the yard to his house.
M	WALT	No, no, no, no, no.
M	PAGE 100	Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair Walt sits, red-eyed. He's done crying. Family photo Father Janovich knocks and eases open the front door.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?
M	WALT	Come on in. Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Are you okay? Walt nods.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	The police finally left. No one is talking. One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.
M	WALT	I've noticed that. Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through
M	WALT	You know, there's no way that Tao or Sue are gonna have any peace if these gang guys don't go away. Go away forever. You know it as well as I do.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	What are you saying?
M	WALT	You heard what I said.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	They took Sue to the hospital. She's scared. They're all scared.
M	WALT	I'm not.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I know that. Believe me, they all know that. Tao especially. He's sitting out there staring at your front door. You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
M	WALT	Yeah, well what would you do if you were me? If you were Tao? What would you do? Father Janovich shakes his head.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I know what I'd do if I was you, or at least what you think you should do. If I was Tao I guess I'd want vengeance. I'd want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
M	WALT	And you?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	What would I do? I'd come over here and talk to you I guess. I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski. Walt nods.
M	WALT	Wanna beer?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'd love one.
M	WALT	They're in the cooler, grab me one too.
M	PAGE 102	Father Janovich grabs four beers, two for each of them.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Damn all this. It just isn't fair.
M	WALT	Nothing's fair, Father. Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	So, what are you going to do, Mr. Kowalski?
M	WALT	Call me Walt. Father Janovich nods.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Alright, what are you going to do, Walt?
M	WALT	Not sure yet. All I do know is they don't have a goddamned chance. Walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking
M	TAO	What are you doing?
M	WALT	I'm thinking.
M	TAO	Thinking time is over. Now it's time to knock the ass out of those pricks.
M	WALT	I know you don't want to hear this, but you have to calm down.
M	TAO	What?!
M	WALT	You have to have a clear head, otherwise mistakes get made. Back away from what's happened, Tao.
M	TAO	No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you. This is going to end, today. Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in.
M	WALT	Sit down.
M	TAO	I don't want to sit.
M	WALT	I SAID SIT DOWN! Just listen up for a second and don't say anything. Tao sits down. Walt rubs his hands together.
M	WALT	I know what needs to be done. I need to prepare, this needs to be carefully planned. You know I'm the right man for this. So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4 P.M. I promise you, what needs to be done, will be done.
M	TAO	I say we go now. Right now.
M	WALT	And do what? You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips. Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood. What do you even know about it? Tao is furious, but says nothing.
M	WALT	Trust me, Tao. Cool down and we'll meet back here at four. Okay? Tao doesn't answer.
M	WALT	I said okay?' You won't do anything without me. You meet me back here at four? Say okay.'
M	TAO	Okay. Tao storms out the back door. Walt pours more coffee. Walt soaks in the tub. It's filled with bubbles. Walt
M	WALT	I know, I know. Give me a break, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house. Walt meticulously mows his lawn. He carefully trims Martin finishes cutting Walt's hair.
M	BARBER	There, all done. Ten bucks American.
M	WALT	I don't suppose you still have steady enough hands to give a guy a straight shave, you withered, old Italian mummy?
M	BARBER	You? A straight shave? You've never ordered a straight shave, ever.
M	WALT	That's right. I always wondered what they were like. Unless you're too goddamned busy?
M	BARBER	No, no. That's fine. Let me heat up a towel. Walt hands Martin the Barber a twenty.
M	WALT	Here's a twenty. Keep the change in case you slip and hit my jugular. Walt gets fitted for a new suit. The OLD TAILOR
M	WALT	So you can take it in right here?
M	TAILOR	Yes, sir. Take about an hour.
M	WALT	That's great. Thank you.
M	TAILOR	Yes, sir.
M	WALT	Never had a fitted suit. Walt comes in and Father Janovich looks up.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Mr. Kowalski, what can I do for you?
M	WALT	I've come for confession.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Oh Lord Jesus, what have you done?
M	WALT	Nothing. Take it easy.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	What are you up to?
M	WALT	Are you going to let me confess or not? Walt calmly sits on one side and a very nervous, sweating
M	FATHER JANOVICH	How long has it been since your last confession?
M	WALT	Forever. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	What are your sins, my son.
M	WALT	In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the work Christmas party. Dorothy was talking with the other wives and it just happened.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Yes. Go on.
M	WALT	I made nine hundred dollars profit selling a boat and motor and never reported the taxes which is the same as stealing.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Yes. Fine.
M	WALT	And lastly, I was never close to my two sons. I don't know them. I didn't know how.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	That's it?
M	WALT	Whatta you mean, That's it?' It's bothered me for years.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	God loves and forgives you. Say ten Hail Marys' and five Our Fathers.' Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue? Walt says nothing. Father Janovich looks hard at Walt.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.
M	WALT	Is that so?
M	FATHER JANOVICH	It is. And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning.
M	WALT	I gotta go, Padre. Busy day ahead.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Go in peace.
M	WALT	I am at peace. Walt and Father Janovich shake hands. Walt exits.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Je -- zuz -- Christ. Walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL.
M	TAO	Which one do I get?
M	WALT	You ever fire a weapon?
M	TAO	No. Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target.
M	WALT	Put that down. I got something for you.
M	TAO	What?
M	WALT	In Korea, October, 1952. We were sent up to sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad. I was the only one who came back... I received the Silver Star. I want you to have it.
M	TAO	Why?
M	WALT	When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten to one against us, but we went anyway. This trouble now, it's similar. We're walking right into it. We might not be coming home tonight.
M	TAO	The hell we won't. We're going to roll in there and tear ass.
M	WALT	Don't be a fool, these guys are waiting for that exact reaction. Tao is quiet for a minute.
M	TAO	How many?
M	WALT	How many what?
M	TAO	How many men did you kill in Korea?
M	WALT	Thirteen for sure. Probably more.
M	TAO	What was it like to kill a man?
M	WALT	You don't want to know.
M	TAO	Why not?
M	WALT	Go get the Silver Star. It's in a blue wooden box in the cellar. Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into
M	CLICK.	Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of
M	TAO	What the hell are you doing?! Let me out of here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch!!
M	WALT	Quit smashing everything. You'll never get out of there, so just relax.
M	TAO	You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or I will kill you when I get out of here. Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength
M	WALT	You want to know how it feels to kill a man? It feels goddamned lousy. And it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up. A dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age. I shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs.
M	PAGE 110	I've thought about that kid for fifty years. And I promise you, boy, you want no part of it. Me, I've got blood on my hands. I'm soiled. Forgive me for tricking you like a dope. I'll call someone and have them let you out later.
M	TAO	No! Let me out!! Tao pounds on the door.
M	WALT	You've come a long way. I'm proud to call you a friend. You have your whole life ahead of you, whereas this is what I do. I finish things. You'd just get in the way. Sorry. Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his Tao howls to be let out. Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash. Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt. She yells
M	WALT	Aw, pipe down, you hag. You're an evil man. I've seen your kind before. Back home, white soldiers came to our villages and filled our young men's minds with ideas of glory. Then you'd lead them away to their deaths. Walt, of course, has no idea what she said.
M	WALT	Fine, I hate you too. Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong. She looks down at
M	WALT	I need you to watch my dog. Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips
M	WALT	Her name is Daisy. Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy. He
M	WALT	You take it easy, old gal. You good old girl. Walt gets up and walks away without looking back. Walt walks in and sits down. He nods to the regulars.
M	WALT	Good afternoon, gentlemen.
M	DARREL	Walter, how are you doing?
M	WALTER	Never been better.
M	BARTENDER	Beer and a shot, Walt?
M	WALT	I think I'll have something different. Walt looks at the liquor display. At the pinnacle of
M	WALT	Think I'll try that Johnnie Walker Blue Label. The regulars all Oooooo and Ahhhhhhh at Walt's order.
M	MEL	Whatta ya win the lottery, Wally?
M	WALT	Naw, just having something special. Walt sips his Scotch and nods. It's good.
M	WALT	Why don't you get all the guys the same.
M	BARTENDER	You sure?
M	WALT	I'm sure. This is too good not to be shared. Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more. Walt slips into the phone booth. He puts in change and Sue weakly answers the phone next to her bed.
F	SUE	Hello? It's Walt. The key to my front door is under the ceramic turtle. Open the door and go let your brother out of the cellar. I have to go. The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up out of Who was that? Where are you going? You tell me what's going on?! Sue squirms away from Phong and runs outside. On her way Father Janovich paces back and forth. The SQUAD CAR
M	OFFICER	Sorry, Father, we have to go.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'm telling you. If we're not here, there will be bloodshed.
M	OFFICER	We've been here for hours. We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'm begging you to stay.
M	OFFICER	I just got word from my Sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
M	FATHER JANOVICH	I'm staying.
M	OFFICER	No you aren't. My orders are specific. You came with us, you're leaving with us. Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting What a goddamned mess. You slopes should be ashamed of yourselves. Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out
M	WALT	Is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the shadows? Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch.
M	SMOKIE	I wasn't sure that you'd...
M	WALT	Shut up, gook. I'm not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you has to say. Spider pulls his PISTOL.
M	WALT	That's right, boy. Defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family. Your own blood, for Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys. Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their
M	WALT	You have no honor. You're the scum of the earth and when you're gone, do you think anyone will care? No one will mourn. You won't be missed. All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of
M	SMOKIE	Where's Tao, old man? He too scared to come and stick up for himself? No. Tao is too good for this. You pukes aren't worth one second of his time. Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this Walt laughs.
M	WALT	You boys are a little bit jumpy.
M	SPIDER	You watch it, old man.
M	WALT	No, I think you'd better watch it. Walt looks around. Other than the gangbangers, a small Sue opens the front door, runs to the stairwell and
F	SUE	Tao? Tao, are you alright? She unlocks the CELLAR DOOR. Tao comes out in a rage.
M	TAO	Goddamn it!
F	SUE	What's going on?
M	TAO	He left without me!
F	SUE	Where? Where'd he go?!
M	TAO	He went to Smokie's without me. Tao takes the stairs two steps at a time.
F	SUE	No! No, Tao! Sue grabs Tao's legs and hangs on.
F	SUE	No! Don't you dare! Stay away from them, Tao! I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
M	TAO	Leave me alone. They struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the The kitchen table. The RIFLE and PISTOL are still there. Walt purposely left the guns at home.
M	TAO	Oh God! NO!!
M	WALT	Anybody got a light? No? I got one. Walt's slight grin fades. He mutters to himself...
M	WALT	Hail Mary, full of grace. Walt reaches into his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers Tao and Sue arrive just as Smokie, Spider and company are Tao looks at Smokie in the squad car. Smokie no longer
M	TAO	What happened?
M	POLICE OFFICER	You have to step back.
M	TAO	He was a friend of mine.
M	POLICE OFFICER	I said step back. Tao turns to the HMONG POLICE OFFICER.
M	TAO	What happened, man? The Hmong Police Officer looks at the WHITE POLICE
M	HMONG POLICE OFFICER	You heard him, step back. Tao speaks to the HMONG OFFICER in their native language. Please, man, it's important. He's my friend. Tell me what happened? The old guy reaches for a lighter and they gunned him down. The gang said the old guy was here to kill them, but he didn't have a weapon. What's going to happen? We actually have witnesses for once. These guys are going away big time. The WHITE OFFICER yells at the HMONG OFFICER.
M	POLICE OFFICER	Officer Chang, get those people back.
M	HMONG POLICE OFFICER	Yes, sir. You have to step back now. Tao hugs his sister. Sue openly weeps. Tao holds it in. Tao and Sue wait in front. Tao wears a suit, Sue is in a Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in We're at the funeral of Walter Kowalski. Walt is dressed Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated Walt's sons and family are there. Mitch gives Tao a
M	FATHER JANOVICH	Walt Kowalski once said to me I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.' Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.' But Walt was right. I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt. And boy, did I learn. All of Walt's family are seated in an office as a LAWYER Tao is present along with Walt's family.
M	LAWYER	Which brings us to our last item. And again, please forgive the language used in Mr. Kowalski's will. I'm simply reading it as it was written. The LAWYER takes a sip of water before reading...
M	LAWYER	And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the condition that you don't choptop the roof like a damned spick, don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear-end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars. It just looks like hell. If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.
