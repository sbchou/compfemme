M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE	Rosebud...
M	NEWS DIGEST NARRATOR	Legendary was the Xanadu where Kubla Kahn decreed his stately pleasure dome - "Where twice five miles of fertile ground, with walls and towers were girdled 'round." Today, almost as legendary is Florida's XANADU - world's largest private pleasure ground. Here, on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned, successfully built for its landlord. Here in a private valley, as in the Coleridge poem, "blossoms many an incense-bearing tree." Verily, "a miracle of rare device."
M	NARRATOR	Here, for Xanadu's landlord, will be held 1940's biggest, strangest funeral; here this week is laid to rest a potent figure of our Century - America's Kubla Kahn - Charles Foster Kane. In journalism's history, other names are honored more than Charles Foster Kane's, more justly revered. Among publishers, second only to James Gordon Bennet the First: his dashing, expatriate son; England's Northcliffe and Beaverbrook; Chicago's Patterson and McCormick;
M	NARRATOR	Denver's Bonfils and Sommes; New York's late, great Joseph Pulitzer; America's emperor of the news syndicate, another editorialist and landlord, the still mighty and once mightier Hearst. Great names all of them - but none of them so loved, hated, feared, so often spoken - as Charles Foster Kane. The San Francisco earthquake. First with the news were the Kane papers. First with Relief of the Sufferers, First with the news of their Relief of the Sufferers. Kane papers scoop the world on the Armistice - publish, eight hours before competitors, complete details of the Armistice teams granted the Germans by Marshall Foch from his railroad car in the Forest of Compeigne. For forty years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand. No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce - often support, then denounce. Its humble beginnings, a dying dailey -
M	NARRATOR	Kane's empire, in its glory, held dominion over thirty-seven newpapers, thirteen magazines, a radio network. An empire upon an empire. The first of grocery stores, paper mills, apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean-liners - An empire through which for fifty years flowed, in an unending stream, the wealth of the earth's third richest gold mine... Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune... How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mine shaft: The Colorado Lode. The magnificent Enquirer Building of today.
M	NARRATOR	Fifty-seven years later, before a Congressional Investigation, Walter P. Thatcher, grand old man of Wall Street, for years chief target of Kane papers' attack on "trusts," recalls a journey he made as a youth...
M	THATCHER	... because of that trivial incident...
M	INVESTIGATOR	It is a fact, however, is it not, that in 1870, you did go to Colorado?
M	THATCHER	I did.
M	INVESTIGATOR	In connection with the Kane affairs?
M	THATCHER	Yes. My firm had been appointed trustees by Mrs. Kane for the fortune, which she had recently acquired. It was her wish that I should take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.
M	NARRATOR	That same month in Union Square -
M	INVESTIGATOR	Is it not a fact that on that occasion, the boy personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled?
M	THATCHER	Mr. Chairman, I will read to this committee a prepared statement I have brought with me - and I will then refuse to answer any further questions. Mr. Johnson, please!
M	THATCHER	"With full awareness of the meaning of my words and the responsibility of what I am about to say, it is my considered belief that Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner in which he has persistently attacked the American traditions of private property, initiative and opportunity for advancement, is - in fact - nothing more or less than a Communist."
M	SPEAKER	- till the words "Charles Foster Kane" are a menace to every working man in this land. He is today what he has always been and always will be - A FASCIST!
M	NARRATOR	And yet another opinion - Kane's own.
M	NARRATOR	Twice married, twice divorced - first to a president's niece, Emily Norton - today, by her second marriage, chatelaine of the oldest of England's stately homes. Sixteen years after that - two weeks after his divorce from Emily Norton - Kane married Susan Alexander, singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey.
M	NARRATOR	For wife two, one-time opera singing Susan Alexander, Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House. Cost: three million dollars. Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half-finished before she divorced him, the still unfinished Xanadu. Cost: no man can say.
M	NARRATOR	One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble, are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain. Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle - two of each; the biggest private zoo since Noah. Contents of Kane's palace: paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace, shipped to Florida from every corner of the earth, from other Kane houses, warehouses, where they mouldered for years. Enough for ten museums - the loot of the world.
M	NARRATOR	Kane urged his country's entry into one war, opposed participation in another. Swung the election to one American President at least, was called another's assassin. Thus, Kane's papers might never have survived - had not the President.
M	NARRATOR	Kane, molder of mass opinion though he was, in all his life was never granted elective office by the voters of his country. Few U.S. news publishers have been. Few, like one-time Congressman Hearst, have ever run for any office - most know better - conclude with other political observers that one man's press has power enough for himself. But Kane papers were once strong indeed, and once the prize seemed almost his. In 1910, as Independent Candidate for governor, the best elements of the state behind him - the White House seemingly the next easy step in a lightning political career -
M	NARRATOR	Then, suddenly - less than one week before election - defeat! Shameful, ignominious - defeat that set back for twenty years the cause of reform in the U.S., forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane. Then, in the third year of the Great Depression... As to all publishers, it sometimes must - to Bennett, to Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper closes! For Kane, in four short years: collapse! Eleven Kane papers, four Kane magazines merged, more sold, scrapped -
M	NARRATOR	Then four long years more - alone in his never-finished, already decaying, pleasure palace, aloof, seldom visited, never photographed, Charles Foster Kane continued to direct his falling empire ... vainly attempting to sway, as he once did, the destinies of a nation that has ceased to listen to him ... ceased to trust him...
M	NARRATOR	Last week, death came to sit upon the throne of America's Kubla Khan - last week, as it must to all men, death came to Charles Foster Kane.
M	THIRD MAN	Stand by. I'll tell you if we want to run it again.
M	THOMPSON'S VOICE	Well?
M	A MAN'S VOICE	It's a tough thing to do in a newsreel. Seventy years of a man's life -
M	A VOICE	See what Arthur Ellis wrote about him in the American review?
M	THIRD MAN	I read it.
M	THE VOICE	table, holding a piece of paper under the desk Listen: Kane is dead. He contributed to the journalism of his day - the talent of a mountebank, the morals of a bootlegger, and the manners of a pasha. He and his kind have almost succeeded in transforming a once noble profession into a seven percent security - no longer secure.
M	ANOTHER VOICE	That's what Arthur Ellis is writing now. Thirty years ago, when Kane gave him his chance to clean up Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis, Kane was the greatest guy in the world. If you ask me -
M	ANOTHER VOICE	Charles Foster Kane was a...
M	RAWLSTON'S VOICE	Just a minute!
M	RAWLSTON	What were Kane's last words?
M	RAWLSTON	What were the last words he said on earth? Thompson, you've made us a good short, but it needs character -
M	SOMEBODY'S VOICE	Motivation -
M	RAWLSTON	That's it - motivation. What made Kane what he was? And, for that matter, what was he? What we've just seen are the outlines of a career - what's behind the career? What's the man? Was he good or bad? Strong or foolish? Tragic or silly? Why did he do all those things? What was he after? Maybe he told us on his death bed.
M	THOMPSON	Yes, and maybe he didn't.
M	RAWLSTON	Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
M	THOMPSON	I know, but -
M	RAWLSTON	All we saw on that screen was a big American -
M	A VOICE	One of the biggest.
M	RAWLSTON	But how is he different from Ford? Or Hearst for that matter? Or Rockefeller - or John Doe?
M	A VOICE	I know people worked for Kane will tell you - not only in the newspaper business - look how he raised salaries. You don't want to forget -
M	ANOTHER VOICE	You take his labor record alone, they ought to hang him up like a dog.
M	RAWLSTON	I tell you, Thompson - a man's dying words -
M	SOMEBODY'S VOICE	What were they?
M	SOMEBODY'S VOICE	Yes, Mr. Rawlston, what were Kane's dying words?
M	RAWLSTON	Rosebud!
M	RAWLSTON	That's right.
M	A VOICE	Tough guy, huh? Dies calling for Rosebud!
M	RAWLSTON	Here's a man who might have been President. He's been loved and hated and talked about as much as any man in our time - but when he comes to die, he's got something on his mind called "Rosebud." What does that mean?
M	ANOTHER VOICE	A racehorse he bet on once, probably, that didn't come in - Rosebud!
M	RAWLSTON	All right. But what was the race?
M	RAWLSTON	Thompson!
M	THOMPSON	Yes, sir.
M	RAWLSTON	Hold this thing up for a week. Two weeks if you have to...
M	THOMPSON	But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days it might be better than if -
M	RAWLSTON	Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. Go after the people that knew Kane well. That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts - I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
M	THOMPSON	I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
M	RAWLSTON	Good!
M	RAWLSTON'S VOICE	It'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing...
M	THE CAPTAIN	This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.
F	SUSAN	I want another drink, John.
M	THE CAPTAIN	Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
M	THOMPSON	I'll have a highball.
F	SUSAN	Who told you you could sit down here?
M	THOMPSON	Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
F	SUSAN	Think again!
F	SUSAN	Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business. You mind yours.
M	THOMPSON	If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
F	SUSAN	Get out of here! Get out! Get out!
M	THOMPSON	I'm sorry. Maybe some other time -
M	THE CAPTAIN	She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
M	THOMPSON	I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
M	THE CAPTAIN	Get her another highball.
M	THE WAITER	Another double?
M	THE CAPTAIN	Yes.
M	THOMPSON	She's plastered, isn't she?
M	THE CAPTAIN	She'll snap out of it. Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. Sooner.
M	THOMPSON	I'll come down in a week or so and see her again. Say, you might be able to help me. When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
M	THE CAPTAIN	Rosebud?
M	THE CAPTAIN	Thank you, sir. As a matter of fact, yesterday afternoon, when it was in all the papers - I asked her. She never heard of Rosebud.
M	BERTHA	Yes. I'll take him in now. The directors of the Thatcher Library have asked me to remind you again of the condition under which you may inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs. Under no circumstances are direct quotations from his manuscript to be used by you.
M	THOMPSON	That's all right.
M	BERTHA	You may come with me.
M	BERTHA	Pages eighty-three to one hundred and forty-two, Jennings.
M	GUARD	Yes, Miss Anderson.
M	BERTHA	You will confine yourself, it is our understanding, to the chapter dealing with Mr. Kane.
M	THOMPSON	That's all I'm interested in.
M	BERTHA	You will be required to leave this room at four-thirty promptly.
F	MRS. KANE	Be careful, Charles!
M	THATCHER'S VOICE	Mrs. Kane -
F	MRS. KANE	Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles -
M	THATCHER'S VOICE	think we'll have to tell him now -
F	MRS. KANE	I'll sign those papers -
M	KANE SR.	You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
F	MRS. KANE	It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
M	KANE SR.	If I want to, I can go to court. father has a right to -
M	THATCHER	Mr. Kane, the certificates that Mr. Graves left here are made out to Mrs. Kane, in her name. Hers to do with as she pleases -
M	KANE SR.	Well, I don't hold with signing my boy away to any bank as guardian just because -
F	MRS. KANE	I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
M	THATCHER	The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final.
M	KANE SR.	The idea of a bank being the guardian -
F	MRS. KANE	I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
M	THATCHER	We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
F	MRS. KANE	past Thatcher's Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
M	THATCHER	Right here, Mrs. Kane.
M	KANE SR.	Don't say I didn't warn you.
M	KANE SR.	Mary, I'm asking you for the last time - anyon'd think I hadn't been a good husband and a -
M	THATCHER	The sum of fifty thousand dollars a year is to be paid to yourself and Mr. Kane as long as you both live, and thereafter the survivor -
M	KANE SR.	Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
F	MRS. KANE	It is. Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
F	KANE	If the rebels want a fight boys, let's give it to 'em!
F	KANE	The terms are underconditional surrender. Up and at 'em! The Union forever!
M	THATCHER	Everything else - the principal as well as all monies earned - is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane, until his twenty-fifth birthday, at which time he is to come into complete possession.
F	MRS. KANE	Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
F	KANE	You can't lick Andy Jackson! Old Hickory, that's me!
M	THATCHER'S VOICE	It's nearly five, Mrs. Kane, don't you think I'd better meet the boy -
F	MRS. KANE	I've got his trunk all packed - I've it packed for a couple of weeks -
M	THATCHER	I've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago. I'd have brought him along with me, but you were so anxious to keep everything secret -
F	KANE	H'ya, Mom.
F	KANE	See, Mom? I took the pipe out of his mouth. If it keeps on snowin', maybe I'll make some teeth and -
F	MRS. KANE	You better come inside, son. You and I have got to get you all ready for - for -
M	THATCHER	Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
F	MRS. KANE	This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
M	THATCHER	How do you do, Charles?
M	KANE SR.	He comes from the east.
F	KANE	Hello. Hello, Pop.
M	KANE SR.	Hello, Charlie!
F	MRS. KANE	Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
M	KANE SR.	That's the train with all the lights.
F	KANE	You goin', Mom?
M	THATCHER	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
F	KANE	Where'm I going?
M	KANE SR.	You're going to see Chicago and New York - and Washington, maybe... Isn't he, Mr. Thatcher?
M	THATCHER	He certainly is. I wish I were a little boy and going to make a trip like that for the first time.
F	KANE	Why aren't you comin' with us, Mom?
F	MRS. KANE	We have to stay here, Charles.
M	KANE SR.	You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie! You're going to be rich. Your Ma figures - that is, re - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
F	MRS. KANE	You won't be lonely, Charles...
M	THATCHER	We're going to have a lot of good times together, Charles... Really we are.
M	THATCHER	Come on, Charles. Let's shake hands. Now, now! I'm not as frightening as all that! Let's shake, what do you say?
M	THATCHER	You almost hurt me, Charles. Sleds aren't to hit people with. Sleds are to - to sleigh on. When we get to New York, Charles, we'll get you a sled that will -
F	MRS. KANE	Charles!
F	KANE	Mom! Mom!
F	MRS. KANE	It's all right, Charles, it's all right.
M	KANE SR.	Sorry, Mr. Thatcher! What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
F	MRS. KANE	That's what you think, is it, Jim?
M	KANE SR.	Yes.
F	MRS. KANE	That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.
F	KANE	Mom! Mom!
M	THATCHER	Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
F	KANE	I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.
M	THATCHER	"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast." You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
F	KANE	Can you prove it isn't?
F	KANE	Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
M	BERNSTEIN	How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
M	THATCHER	How do you do? -
M	BERNSTEIN	We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr. Kane -
F	KANE	That's all right. We have no secrets from our readers. Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein. He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
M	BERNSTEIN	The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
M	THATCHER	You see! There hasn't been a true word -
F	KANE	I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein. Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not. Let me see - Mike!
M	MIKE	Go ahead, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Dear Wheeler - You provide the prose poems - I'll provide the war.
M	BERNSTEIN	That's fine, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	I rather like it myself. Send it right away.
M	MIKE	Right away.
M	BERNSTEIN	Right away.
M	THATCHER	I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
F	KANE	Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
M	THATCHER	I think I should remind you, Charles, of a fact you seem to have forgotten. You are yourself one of the largest individual stockholders.
F	KANE	Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
M	THATCHER	They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
F	KANE	The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
F	KANE	As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty-two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you. Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
M	THATCHER	Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
F	KANE	On the other hand - I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money - mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests! I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher. I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property -
F	KANE	If I don't defend the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will - maybe somebody without any money or any property and that would be too bad.
F	KANE	Do you know how to tap, Mr. Thatcher? You ought to learn -
M	THATCHER	I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles. Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise - this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
F	KANE	You're right. We did lose a million dollars last year.
F	KANE	We expect to lost a million next year, too. You know, Mr. Thatcher - at the rate of a million a year - we'll have to close this place in sixty years.
F	MISS ANDERSON	You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man. Did you find what you were looking for?
M	THOMPSON	No. Tell me something, Miss Anderson. You're not Rosebud, are you?
F	MISS ANDERSON	What?
M	THOMPSON	I didn't think you were. Well, thanks for the use of the hall.
M	BERNSTEIN	Who's a busy man? Me? I'm Chairman of the Board. I got nothing but time ... What do you want to know?
M	THOMPSON	Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
M	BERNSTEIN	From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end. Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
M	THOMPSON	- We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
M	BERNSTEIN	That Rosebud? Maybe some girl? There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
M	THOMPSON	Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
M	BERNSTEIN	You're pretty young, Mr. - Mr. Thompson. A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. See what I mean? Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
M	THOMPSON	I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
M	BERNSTEIN	Who else you been to see?
M	THOMPSON	Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
M	BERNSTEIN	Susie? I called her myself the day after he died. I thought maybe somebody ought to... She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
M	THOMPSON	You know why? She was so -
M	BERNSTEIN	Sure, sure.
M	THOMPSON	I'm going back there.
M	BERNSTEIN	Who else did you see?
M	THOMPSON	Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
M	BERNSTEIN	Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
M	THOMPSON	He made an awful lot of money.
M	BERNSTEIN	It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. Thatcher!
M	BERNSTEIN	He never knew there was anything in the world but money. That kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week - and twice on Sundays! The time he came to Rome for Mr. Kane's twenty-fifth birthday... You know, when Mr. Kane got control of his own money... Such a fool like Thatcher - I tell you, nobody's business!
M	BERNSTEIN	He knew what he wanted, Mr. Kane did, and he got it! Thatcher never did figure him out. He was hard to figure sometimes, even for me. Mr. Kane was a genius like he said. He had that funny sense of humor. Sometimes even I didn't get the joke. Like that night the opera house of his opened in Chicago... You know, the opera house he built for Susie, she should be an opera singer... That was years later, of course - 1914 it was. Mrs. Kane took the leading part in the opera, and she was terrible. But nobody had the nerve to say so - not even the critics. Mr. Kane was a big man in those days. But this one fellow, this friend of his, Branford Leland -
M	CITY EDITOR	What about Branford Leland? Has he got in his copy?
M	HIRELING	Not yet.
M	BERNSTEIN	Go in and ask him to hurry.
M	CITY EDITOR	Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
M	BERNSTEIN	I might make him nervous.
M	CITY EDITOR	You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
M	BERNSTEIN	That's right. They called us the "Three Musketeers."
M	CITY EDITOR	He's a great guy - Leland. Why'd he ever leave New York?
M	BERNSTEIN	That's a long story.
M	ANOTHER HIRELING	Wasn't there some sort of quarrel between -
M	BERNSTEIN	I had nothing to do with it. It was Leland and Mr. Kane, and you couldn't call it a quarrel exactly. Better we should forget such things - Leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle?
M	CITY EDITOR	Yes. I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
M	BERNSTEIN	And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?
M	CITY EDITOR	Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
M	BERNSTEIN	Enthusiastic?
M	CITY EDITOR	Yes, very! Naturally.
M	BERNSTEIN	Well, well - isn't that nice?
M	KANE'S VOICE	Mr. Bernstein -
M	BERNSTEIN	Hello, Mr. Kane.
M	CITY EDITOR	Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
F	KANE	We've got a nice plant here.
F	KANE	Was the show covered by every department?
M	CITY EDITOR	Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.
F	KANE	And the notice?
M	CITY EDITOR	Yes - Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Is it good?
M	CITY EDITOR	Yes, Mr. kane.
M	CITY EDITOR	But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
F	KANE	It isn't finished?
M	CITY EDITOR	No, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	That's Leland, isn't it?
M	CITY EDITOR	Yes, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Has he said when he'll finish?
M	CITY EDITOR	We haven't heard from him.
F	KANE	He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
M	BERNSTEIN	He sure did, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Where is he?
M	ANOTHER HIRELING	Right in there, Mr. Kane.
M	BERNSTEIN	MR. KANE -
F	KANE	That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
M	BERNSTEIN	Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't spoke together for ten years. Excuse me.
M	BERNSTEIN	Hey, Brad! Brad! He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never. We would have heard.
F	KANE	What does it say there?
F	KANE	What's he written?
M	BERNSTEIN	"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Thais.
M	BERNSTEIN	"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department. Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..."
F	KANE	Go on!
M	BERNSTEIN	That's all there is.
F	KANE	Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
M	BERNSTEIN	I didn't see that.
F	KANE	It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
M	BERNSTEIN	I can't take shorthand.
F	KANE	Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.
M	BERNSTEIN	He finished it. He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved. We ran it in every paper.
M	THOMPSON	I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
M	BERNSTEIN	He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl. After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. Oh, I don't blame Susie -
M	THOMPSON	Well, then, how could he write that roast? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
M	BERNSTEIN	Oh, yes. He saw to that. I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out. He had that funny sense of humor. And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so. I guess he showed him all right. He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer. They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
M	CARTER	Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
F	KANE	Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
M	CARTER	How do you do, Mr. Leland?
F	KANE	Are they standing for me?
M	CARTER	I thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher -
F	KANE	Ask them to sit down.
M	CARTER	You may resume your work, gentlemen. I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
F	KANE	I don't my plans myself.
F	KANE	As a matter of fact, I haven't got any. Except to get out a newspaper.
F	KANE	Oh, Mr. Bernstein!
F	KANE	If you would come here a moment, please, Mr. Bernstein?
F	KANE	Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
M	CARTER	How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
F	KANE	You've got a private office here, haven't you?
M	CARTER	My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
F	KANE	I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.
M	CARTER	But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
F	KANE	That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
F	KANE	I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing. Probably murdered. A Mrs. Harry Silverstone. Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
M	CARTER	Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
F	KANE	I'm still hungry, Brad. Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter. Why haven't we?
M	CARTER	There is no news big enough.
F	KANE	If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
M	CARTER	As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter. And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
F	KANE	The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter. It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
M	CARTER	It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives. If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
F	KANE	That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.
M	CARTER	Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
F	KANE	Oh, Mr. Bernstein!
F	KANE	I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
M	BERNSTEIN	I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
M	CARTER	But, Mr. Kane -
F	KANE	That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
F	LELAND	Poor Mr. Carter!
F	KANE	What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
M	BERNSTEIN	Three cents.
F	KANE	Two cents.
M	BERNSTEIN	This is all figured at three cents a copy.
F	KANE	Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
M	BERNSTEIN	All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
F	KANE	Ready for dinner, Brad?
M	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
F	LELAND	I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein. You people work too fast for me! Talk about new brooms!
M	BERNSTEIN	Who said anything about brooms?
F	KANE	It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.
M	BERNSTEIN	Oh!
M	SMATHERS	But it's impossible, Mr. Kane. We can't remake these pages.
F	KANE	These pages aren't made up as I want them, Mr. Smathers. We go to press in five minutes.
M	CARTER	The "Enquirer" has an old and honored tradition, Mr. Kane... The "Enquirer" is not in competition with those other rags.
M	BERNSTEIN	We should be publishing such rags, that's all I wish. Why, the "Enquirer" - I wouldn't wrap up the liver for the cat in the "Enquirer" -
M	CARTER	Mr. Kane, I must ask you to see to it that this - this person learns to control his tongue.
M	CARTER	I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend - - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this - I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
F	KANE	It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
M	CARTER	But Mr. Kane, I meant -
F	KANE	Let's remake these pages, Mr. Smathers. We'll have to publish a half hour late, that's all.
M	SMATHERS	We can't remake them, Mr. Kane. We go to press in five minutes.
F	KANE	You can remake them now, can't you, Mr. Smathers?
F	KANE	After the types 've been reset and the pages have been remade according to the way I told you before, Mr. Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled and bring them to me. Then, if I can't find any way to improve them again - - I suppose we'll have to go to press.
M	BERNSTEIN	In case you don't understand, Mr. Smathers - he's a new broom.
M	NEWSBOYS' VOICES	CHRONICLE! CHRONICLE! H'YA - THE CHRONICLE - GET YA! CHRONICLE!
F	LELAND	We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
M	BERNSTEIN	It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
F	KANE	Tired?
F	LELAND	It's been a tough day.
F	KANE	A wasted day.
M	BERNSTEIN	Wasted?
F	LELAND	Charlie?!
M	BERNSTEIN	You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane. That's all -
F	KANE	I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
F	LELAND	What're you going to do, Charlie?
F	KANE	My Declaration of Principles - Don't smile, Brad - Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
M	BERNSTEIN	Can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
F	KANE	I'll write it myself.
M	BERNSTEIN	You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
F	KANE	These'll be kept. I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. will also provide them -
F	LELAND	That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
F	KANE	People are going to know who's responsible. And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
M	BERNSTEIN	Sixty-two thousand -
F	LELAND	That looks pretty nice.
F	KANE	Let's hope they like it there.
M	BERNSTEIN	From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
F	KANE	Look at that.
F	LELAND	The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
F	KANE	It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.
M	BERNSTEIN	Say, with them fellows - - it's no trick to get circulation.
F	KANE	You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
M	BERNSTEIN	You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together? Twenty years.
F	KANE	I know.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	That's all. Thank you.
F	KANE	Make up an extra copy and mail it to the "Chronicle."
F	KANE	Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"! This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
M	BERNSTEIN	Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
F	KANE	All of you - new and old - You're all getting the best salaries in town. Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. It's your talent I'm interested in. That talent that's going to make the "Enquirer" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world!
F	KANE	However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night. There are other subjects in the world.
M	THE OFFICIAL	There you are, Mr. Kane. Everything in order.
F	KANE	Thank you.
M	THE OFFICIAL	Have a good rest, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Thanks.
M	BERNSTEIN	But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings. Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
F	KANE	I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
M	STEWARD'S VOICE	All ashore!
F	KANE	- and to forget about the new feature sections - and not to try to think up and ideas for comic sections.
M	STEWARD'S VOICE	All ashore that's going ashore!
F	KANE	Goodbye, gents! Hey!
F	KANE	You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
M	BERNSTEIN	Do you, Mr. Leland?
F	LELAND	Certainly not.
F	KANE	Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
M	BERNSTEIN	Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
M	BERNSTEIN	So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? Especially the new papers -
F	KANE	We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. But right now - that lady over there - - that's the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
M	BERNSTEIN	Huh? Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
M	BERNSTEIN	Miss Townsend -
F	MISS TOWNSEND	Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.
M	BERNSTEIN	This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.
F	KANE	Miss Townsend -
F	KANE	I've been away for several months, and I don't know exactly how these things are handled now. But one thing I wanted to be sure of is that you won't treat this little announcement any differently than you would any other similar announcement.
F	KANE	Read it, Miss Townsend. And remember - just the regular treatment! See you at nine o'clock, Mr. Bernstein!
F	MISS TOWNSEND	Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to Mr. Charles Foster Kane.
M	BERNSTEIN	Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton announce -
F	MISS TOWNSEND	She's - she's the niece of - of the President of the United States -
M	BERNSTEIN	know. Come on, Miss Townsend - From the window, maybe we can get a look.
M	BERNSTEIN	A girl like that, believe me, she's lucky! Presiden't niece, huh! Say, before he's through, she'll be a Presiden't wife.
M	BERNSTEIN	The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
M	THOMPSON	It didn't end very well, did it?
M	BERNSTEIN	It ended - Then there was Susie - that ended, too. guess he didn't make her very happy - You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
M	THOMPSON	Yes -
M	BERNSTEIN	Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
M	THOMPSON	In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
M	BERNSTEIN	You don't say! Why I had no idea -
M	THOMPSON	Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me. Just -
M	BERNSTEIN	Just old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. You ought to see Mr. Leland. There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
M	LELAND'S VOICE	When you get to my age, young man, you don't miss anything. Unless maybe it's a good drink of bourbon. Even that doesn't make much difference, if you remember there hasn't been any good bourbon in this country for twenty years.
M	THOMPSON	Mr. Leland, you were -
F	LELAND	You don't happen to have a cigar, do you? I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn't I? Dear, dear! What a disagreeable old man I've become. You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane? Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself. He never - gave himself away - He never gave anything away. He just - left you a tip. He had a generous mind. I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant. Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death. But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something. You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
M	THOMPSON	Sorry, Mr. Leland.
F	LELAND	Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
M	THOMPSON	Maybe you could remember something that -
F	LELAND	I can remember everything. That's my curse, young man. It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race. Memory - I was his oldest friend. As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine. Maybe I wasnt' his friend. If I wasn't, he never had one. Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
M	KANE'S VOICE	Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty. It's your talent I'm interested in. That talent that's going to make the "Enquirer" the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world!
M	BERNSTEIN	Isn't it wonderful? Such a party!
F	LELAND	Yes.
M	KANE'S VOICE	However, I think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night.
M	BERNSTEIN	What's the matter?
F	LELAND	Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
M	BERNSTEIN	Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
F	KANE	There are other subjects in the world -
F	LELAND	Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
M	BERNSTEIN	Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
F	LELAND	Probably. There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
F	KANE	Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
F	LELAND	Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
F	KANE	It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - I tell you, Brad, I envy you. By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
F	LELAND	But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
F	KANE	All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to. Hello, Georgie.
M	GEORGIE	Is everything the way you want it, dear?
F	KANE	If everybody's having fun, that's the way I want it.
M	GEORGIE	I've got some other little girls coming over -
F	LELAND	Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
F	KANE	How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
F	LELAND	They do it only because you do!
F	KANE	And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it? I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
M	GEORGIE	Glad to meet you, Brad.
F	KANE	I told you about Brad, Georgie. He needs to relax.
F	KANE	Some ships with wonderful wines have managed to slip through the enemy fleet that's blockading New York harbor - Georgie knows a young lady whom I'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't he, Georgie? Why only the other evening I said to myself, if Brad were only here to adore this young lady - this - What's her name again?
M	GEORGIE	Ethel - this gentlemen has been very anxious to meet you - This is Ethel.
F	ETHEL	Hello, Mr. Leland.
M	ONE OF THE GIRLS	Charlie! Play the song about you.
M	ANOTHER GIRL	Is there a song about Charlie?
F	KANE	Say, Brad. I've got an idea.
F	LELAND	Yes?
F	KANE	I mean I've got a job for you.
F	LELAND	Good.
F	KANE	You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
F	LELAND	I'd like that.
F	KANE	You start tomorrow night. Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken." I'll get us some girls. You get tickets. A drama critic gets them free, you know. Rector's at seven?
F	LELAND	Charlie -
F	KANE	Yes?
F	LELAND	It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
F	KANE	You're wrong. It does make a difference to you - Rector's, Brad? Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. You won't miss anything. It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
F	KANE	You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
M	BERNSTEIN	Do you, Mr. Leland?
F	LELAND	Certainly not.
M	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him? He wanted you to. He said to me just yesterday -
F	LELAND	I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
F	LELAND	Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
M	BERNSTEIN	Don't I always? Most of the time?
F	LELAND	Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?
M	BERNSTEIN	Yes.
M	BERNSTEIN	If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
F	LELAND	You're in a conspiracy against me, you two. You always have been.
M	BERNSTEIN	Against me there should be such a conspiracy some time!
M	BERNSTEIN	Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic. I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
F	LELAND	September the ninth?
F	LELAND	I used to go to dancing school with her.
F	LELAND	What's this?
M	THOMPSON	It's a letter from her lawyers.
F	LELAND	David, Grobleski & Davis - My dear Rawlston -
M	THOMPSON	Rawlston is my boss.
F	LELAND	Oh, yes. I know about Mr. Rawlston.
M	THOMPSON	He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially - That's the answer we got.
F	LELAND	I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday. I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane.
F	LELAND	Brief marriage! Ten years!
M	THOMPSON	Was he in love?
F	LELAND	He married for love - That's why he did everything. That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him, too. All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it. You see, he just didn't have any to give. He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her. As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are. I guess there's more than two sides -
M	THE PRESIDENT	It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people. You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
F	KANE	I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President! I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks!
M	THE PRESIDENT	I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	It's the only vein I know. I tell the facts the way I see them. And any man that knows that facts -
M	THE PRESIDENT	I know the facts, Mr. Kane. And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean. You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Thanks.
M	THE PRESIDENT	I understand that you have political ambitions. Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
F	KANE	I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me. However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
M	THE PRESIDENT	You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane. Good day.
F	KANE	Mr. President.
M	FOREMAN	How about it, Mr. Kane?
F	KANE	All right. Let her slide!
M	REILLY	Looks bad for us, Mr. Kane. How shall we handle it?
F	KANE	It's a news story! Get it on the street!
F	KANE	Take dictation - Front page editorial - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated. He was the President of the United States -"
F	LELAND	Charlie -
F	KANE	Yes?
F	LELAND	Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
F	KANE	Why not?
F	LELAND	Why not? Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
M	REILLY	Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
F	KANE	What do you mean by that?
F	LELAND	Competition.
M	REILLY	He may recover -
F	KANE	What do you mean by that?
F	LELAND	Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.
F	KANE	Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
F	LELAND	- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
F	KANE	I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
F	LELAND	You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
F	KANE	They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
F	LELAND	Charlie!
F	KANE	Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me because -
F	LELAND	Look out that window.
F	LELAND	There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
F	KANE	What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
F	LELAND	Charlie! Now you're not making sense.
F	KANE	I don't have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that. Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her.
F	LELAND	What?
F	KANE	I've got to think of Emily -
F	LELAND	I'd like to talk to you about that.
F	KANE	Go ahead.
F	LELAND	Finish your editorial.
F	LELAND	What's happened?
M	BERNSTEIN	I'm all right, Mr. Leland. Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me. I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
M	THE COP	You sure did - Say, the Commissioner said I was to stand by and protect Mr. Kane until further orders, no matter how he felt about it. Where is he?
F	LELAND	In there.
M	BERNSTEIN	If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
F	LELAND	Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
M	BERNSTEIN	Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
F	LELAND	Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
M	REILLY	Goodnight, Mr. Kane.
F	LELAND	First of all -
F	KANE	What's wrong, Brad?
F	LELAND	I'm drunk.
F	KANE	I'll get you some coffee.
F	LELAND	First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
F	KANE	That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you - Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
M	MIKE'S VOICE	Sure thing, Mr. Kane.
F	LELAND	Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
F	KANE	Why, Brad?
F	LELAND	I want to be transferred to the new paper. You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - That's not what I wanted to talk about.
F	KANE	I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
F	LELAND	No, that won't help. Besides, you never get drunk. I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
F	KANE	All right.
F	LELAND	She's going to leave you -
F	KANE	I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
F	LELAND	She was going to leave you anyway -
F	LELAND	Emily's going south next week with the child. As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. When they get back -
F	KANE	Brad, you are drunk.
F	LELAND	Sure I am. She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
F	KANE	Why is she leaving me?
F	LELAND	She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
F	KANE	Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
F	LELAND	You might have made the whole thing less personal!
F	LELAND	It isn't just that the President was her uncle - everyone she knows, all the people she's been brought up with, everything she's ever been taught to believe is important -
F	LELAND	There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
F	KANE	The personal note is all there is to it. It's all there ever is to it. It's all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
F	LELAND	You almost convince me. I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth. I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward. You know that. That's why you keep me around. You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie. I guess that's why you ran away from Emily. Because you can't stand the company of your equals. You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
F	LELAND	You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you. When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man? You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all. And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
F	KANE	Are you finished?
F	LELAND	Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
F	KANE	You're not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
F	LELAND	That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?
F	KANE	Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
F	LELAND	You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
F	KANE	It's simpler than that, Brad. A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all. Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
F	KANE	She can leave me. As a matter of fact, I've already left her. Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
F	LELAND	I know you will.
F	KANE	Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
F	KANE	To love on my terms. Those are the only terms anybody knows ... his own.
M	A VOICE FROM THE CROWD	You moiderer!
F	KANE	Are you hurt?
F	LELAND	No. I wish you'd go home to Emily. She'll be pretty upset by all this - She still loves you -
F	KANE	You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
F	LELAND	Yes.
F	KANE	Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
F	LELAND	I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie. We'll let the salary stay where it is.
F	KANE	Excuse us a moment, please.
F	KANE	I said, excuse us a moment.
F	KANE	I've been talking to Leland. Emily - You can't leave me now - not now - It isn't what it would do to my changes in politics, Emily - That isn't it - They were talking of running me for governor, but now, of course, we'll have to wait - It isn't that, Emily - It's just - the president is your uncle and they're saying I killed him.
F	KANE	That story about the murderer having a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket - the "Chronicle" made that up out of whole cloth - Emily, please - He's going to be all right, you know, he's going to recover - If it will make you any happier, we had nine pages of advertising cancelled in the first mail this morning. Bernstein is afraid to open any more letters. He -
F	KANE	What do you expect me to do? What in the world -
F	EMILY	Charles.
F	EMILY	Do you really think - Those threatening letters, can they really -
F	KANE	They won't do anything to Junior, darling. Anonymous letter writers - I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
F	EMILY	Please don't talk any more, Charles.
F	EMILY	Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
F	KANE	I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right. He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
F	EMILY	Here I am, darling... Darling!... Darling, it's all right... Mother's here.
F	KANE	Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
F	EMILY	They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you! Mother's looking after you!
F	KANE	We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
M	REILLY	Mr. Leland sent back that check.
F	KANE	What check?
M	REILLY	You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
F	KANE	Oh, yes, the bonus.
M	REILLY	It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
M	REILLY	He sent it back torn up - all torn up into little bits, and he enclosed something else - I can't make it out.
M	REILLY	It says here, "A Declaration of Principles" - "I will provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly" -
F	KANE	It is no secret that I entered upon this campaign with no thought that I could be elected Governor of this state! It is now no secret that every straw vote, every independent pole, shows that I will be elected. And I repeat to you - my first official act as Governor will be to appoint a special District Attorney to arrange for the indictment, prosecution and conviction of Boss Edward G. Rogers!
M	FIRST CIVIC LEADER	Great speech, Mr. Kane.
M	SECOND LEADER	One of the most notable public utterances ever made by a candidate in this state -
F	KANE	Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.
M	REILLY	A wonderful speech, Mr. Kane.
M	REILLY	I just got word from Buffalo, Mr. Kane. They're going to throw you the organization vote - and take a chance maybe you'll give them a break -
M	REILLY	On an independent ticket there's never been anything like it! If the election were held today, you'd be elected by a hundred thousand votes - and every day between now and November 7th is just going to add to your majority.
F	KANE	It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
M	REILLY	Rogers isn't even pretending. He isn't just scared anymore. He's sick. Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
F	KANE	I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. Well, Mr. Bernstein?
M	BERNSTEIN	It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. Wonderful. Wonderful.
F	KANE	You don't really think so?
M	BERNSTEIN	I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only - - Can I say something?
F	KANE	Please, Mr. Bernstein.
M	BERNSTEIN	Well, the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
M	BERNSTEIN	Well, you're running for Governor and going to be elected - my idea is how wonderful it would be if you don't run at all and don't get elected.
M	JUNIOR	Is Pop Governor yet, Mom?
F	KANE	Hello, Butch! Did you like your old man's speech?
M	JUNIOR	Hello, Pop! I was in a box. I could hear every word.
F	KANE	I saw you! Good night, gentlemen.
F	EMILY	I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
F	KANE	But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
F	EMILY	There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
F	KANE	It can wait.
F	EMILY	No, it can't. Good night, darling.
M	JUNIOR	Good night, Mom.
F	KANE	What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and -
F	EMILY	It may not be about anything at all.
M	THE DRIVER	Cab?
F	EMILY	I intend to find out.
F	KANE	I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
F	EMILY	I'm going to - - 185 West 74th Street.
F	EMILY	If you wish, you can come with me...
F	KANE	I'll go with you.
F	KANE	I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emiliy.
M	THE MAID	Come in, Mr. Kane, come in.
F	SUSAN	It wasn't my fault, Charlie. He made me send your wife a note. He said I'd - oh, he's been saying the most terrible things, I didn't know what to do... I -
M	ROGERS	Good evening, Mr. Kane. I don't suppose anybody would introduce us. Mrs. Kane, I am Edward Rogers.
F	EMILY	How do you do? I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... because I recieved this note -
M	ROGERS	I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note. She was a little unwilling at first - but she did it.
F	SUSAN	I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. You haven't got any idea -
F	KANE	Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. To start with, I'll break your neck.
M	ROGERS	Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
F	EMILY	Charles! Your - your breaking this man's neck - would scarcely explain this note - Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - for myself, and for my son. What does this note mean, Miss -
F	SUSAN	I'm Susan Alexander. I know what you think, Mrs. Kane, but -
F	EMILY	What does this note mean, Miss Alexander?
M	ROGERS	She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane. She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
F	KANE	In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - is -
M	ROGERS	I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one. I don't even know what a gentleman is. You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had. Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper. Or his mother. It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
F	EMILY	Oh!!
F	KANE	You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
M	ROGERS	Anything you say, Mr. Kane. Only we're talking now about what you are. That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane. Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table. I'm fighting for my life. Not just my political life. My life. If your husband is elected governor -
F	KANE	I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
F	EMILY	Let him finish, Charles.
M	ROGERS	I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane. This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher. Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected. I don't care whether they know what I know about him. Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral - Champeen of the people. Just as long as -
F	EMILY	I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but wonder if -
F	KANE	You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
F	SUSAN	Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
M	ROGERS	That's the chance I'm willing to give you, Mr. Kane. More of a chance than you'd give me. Unless you make up your mind by tomorrow that you're so sick that you've got to go away for a year or two - Monday morning every paper in this State will carry the story I'm going to give them.
F	EMILY	What story, Mr. Rogers?
M	ROGERS	The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
F	SUSAN	There is no story. It's all lies. Mr. Kane is just -
M	ROGERS	Shut up! I've had a dozen men doing nothing but run this thing down - we've got evidence enough to - well, the evidence would stand up in any court of law. You want me to give you the evidence, Mr. Kane?
F	KANE	You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust. If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
M	ROGERS	Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me. I'd like to show you -
F	EMILY	You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers. I believe you.
M	ROGERS	I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him. But I'd be better off that way - - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
F	SUSAN	What about me? He said my name'd be dragged through the mud. He said everywhere I'd go from now on -
F	EMILY	There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles. I'd say that it has been made for you. I suppose the details can be arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers. About the statements by the doctors -
F	KANE	Have you gone completely mad, Emily?
F	KANE	You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
F	EMILY	I don't see what else you can do, Charles. If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
F	KANE	Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
F	EMILY	Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. I'll be in it, too, won't I? And Junior?
F	KANE	I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
F	EMILY	I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now. I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
F	SUSAN	Charlie! If they publish this story -
F	EMILY	They won't. Goodnight, Mr. Rogers. There's nothing more to be said, Charles.
F	KANE	Oh yes, there is.
F	EMILY	I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
F	KANE	No.
F	KANE	There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. And if you think - if any of you think -
F	EMILY	You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
F	KANE	Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone!
M	ROGERS	You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane. You're licked. Why don't you -
F	KANE	Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
M	ROGERS	I see!
F	SUSAN	Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -
F	KANE	I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!
F	EMILY	Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
F	KANE	Too late for what? Too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me? Well, you won't do it, I tell you. You won't do it!
F	SUSAN	Charlie, there are other things to think of. Your son - you don't want him to read in the papers -
F	EMILY	It is too late now, Charles.
F	KANE	Get out, both of you!
F	SUSAN	Charlie, please don't -
F	KANE	What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
F	EMILY	Goodnight, Charles.
M	ROGERS	You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane. If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson.
F	KANE	Don't you worry about me. I'm Charles Foster Kane. I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
F	KANE	I'm going to send you to Sing Sing, Rogers. Sing Sing!
F	EMILY	Hello, Brad -
F	LELAND	Emily -
F	EMILY	I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - didn't -
F	LELAND	Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
F	LELAND	I'm glad to see you.
F	EMILY	Are all the returns in?
F	EMILY	Let me see it.
F	LELAND	Almost two to one -
F	EMILY	I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
F	LELAND	Emily!
F	EMILY	Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
F	LELAND	Emily, you're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
F	EMILY	There aren't any personal lives for people like us. He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
F	LELAND	know that, Emily -
F	EMILY	Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
F	LELAND	Emily, you -
F	EMILY	Brad, I'm - I'm not an old woman yet -
F	LELAND	It's - all over -
F	EMILY	Know it is, Brad -
F	LELAND	He's paying for it, Emily. Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically - - socially, everywhere, I guess. don't know about the papers, but -
F	EMILY	If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time. There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact. That - that shabby little girl. I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
M	BERNSTEIN	Hello, Mr. Leland.
F	LELAND	Hello, Bernstein.
F	LELAND	Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
M	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Kane is finishing it.
F	LELAND	Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
F	LELAND	I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
M	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
M	BERNSTEIN	He's writing a roast like you wanted it to be - - I guess that'll show you.
F	KANE	Hello, Brad.
F	LELAND	Hello, Charlie - I didn't know we were speaking.
F	KANE	Sure, we're speaking, Brad - you're fired.
F	LELAND	Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills. Hey, nurse! Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South - - you know. Shangri-la? El Dorado? Sloppy Joe's? What's the name of that place? You know... All right. Xanadu. I knew what it was all the time. You caught on, didn't you?
M	THOMPSON	Yes.
F	LELAND	I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think. Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have. I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years. He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything. Of course, he built it for her -
M	THOMPSON	That must have been love.
F	LELAND	I don't know. He was disappointed in the world. So he built one of his own - An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - Nurse! Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
M	THOMPSON	Sure.
F	LELAND	On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
M	THOMPSON	Sure, Mr. Leland. I'll be glad to.
F	LELAND	Hey, Nurse!
M	NURSE	Hello, Mr. Leland.
F	LELAND	I'm ready to go in now. You know when I was a young man, there was an impression around that nurses were pretty. It was no truer then than it is now.
M	NURSE	Here, let me take your arm, Mr. Leland.
F	LELAND	All right, all right. move forward on You won't forget, will you, about the cigars? And tell them to wrap them up to look like toothpaste, or something, or they'll stop them at the desk. That young doctor I was telling you about, he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive.
F	SUSAN	How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
M	THOMPSON	I'd rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
F	SUSAN	You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
M	THOMPSON	How did you meet him?
F	SUSAN	I had a toothache.
F	SUSAN	That was thiry years ago - and I still remember that toothache. Boy! That toothache was just driving me crazy...
F	KANE	Ow!
F	KANE	It's not funny.
F	SUSAN	I'm sorry, mister - but you do look awful funny.
F	SUSAN	Ow!
F	KANE	What's the matter with you?
F	SUSAN	Toothache.
F	KANE	Hmm!
F	SUSAN	You've got some on your face.
F	KANE	If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
F	KANE	What's funny now?
F	SUSAN	You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.
F	SUSAN	Oh!
F	KANE	You're no Venus de Milo.
F	SUSAN	If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
F	KANE	Thanks.
F	SUSAN	My landlady prefers me to keep this door open when I have a gentleman caller. She's a very decent woman. Ow!
F	SUSAN	Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
F	KANE	I'm sorry. They live here, too?
F	SUSAN	No. They've passed on.
F	KANE	Where's the soap?
F	SUSAN	In the water.
F	KANE	You're very easily amused.
F	SUSAN	I always like to see the funny side of things. No sense crying when you don't have to. And you're so funny. Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
F	SUSAN	Oh!
F	KANE	I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
F	SUSAN	I know... But you do look so silly.
F	KANE	Where's the towel?
F	SUSAN	On the chiffonier. Here.
F	KANE	Thanks.
F	SUSAN	I've got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
F	KANE	I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
F	KANE	You are in pain, aren't you, you poor kid?
F	KANE	Wish there was something I could -
F	KANE	I've got an idea, young lady. Turn around and look at me. I said, turn around and look at me, young lady.
F	KANE	Did you ever see anybody wiggle both his ears at the same time?
F	KANE	Watch closely! It took me two solid years at the finest boys' school in the world to learn that trick. The fellow who taught me is President of Venezuela now.
F	KANE	That's it! Smile!
F	SUSAN	A chicken?
F	KANE	No. But you're close.
F	SUSAN	A rooster?
F	KANE	You're getting farther away all the time. It's a duck.
F	SUSAN	Excuse me, Mr. Kane. I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you? I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, guess you caught on to that -
F	KANE	You really don't know who I am?
F	SUSAN	No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
F	KANE	But you like me, don't you? Even though you don't know who I am?
F	SUSAN	You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
F	KANE	And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
F	SUSAN	I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
F	KANE	I was only joking! This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
F	KANE	You see, my mother died, too - a long time ago. Her things were put into storage out west because I had no place to put them then. I still haven't. But now I've sent for them just the same. And tonight I'd planned to make a sort of sentimental journey - - to the scenes of my youth - my childhood, I suppose - to look again at - and now -
F	KANE	Who am I? Well, let's see. Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - I run a couple of newspapers. How about you?
F	SUSAN	Oh, me -
F	KANE	How old did you say you were?
F	SUSAN	I didn't say.
F	KANE	I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
F	SUSAN	Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.
F	KANE	That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
F	SUSAN	I work at Seligman's.
F	KANE	Is that what you want to do?
F	SUSAN	I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.
F	KANE	What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
F	SUSAN	Oh, no! Nothing like that. Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me. Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
F	KANE	Yes -
F	SUSAN	As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
F	KANE	Would you sing for me?
F	SUSAN	Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
F	KANE	Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
F	SUSAN	Well, I -
F	KANE	Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
F	SUSAN	Oh, no, that's all gone.
F	KANE	Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
F	SUSAN	I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie - I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
M	THOMPSON	What did you get?
F	SUSAN	What do you mean?
F	SUSAN	I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it.
M	THOMPSON	He married you, didn't he?
F	SUSAN	He was in love with me. But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
M	THOMPSON	What about that apartment?
F	SUSAN	He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother? You don't believe me, but it's true. It just happens to be true. He was really interested in my voice. What are you smiling for? What do you think he built that opera house for? I didn't want it. I didn't want to sing. It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
M	MATISTI	Impossible! Impossible!
F	KANE	Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
M	MATISTI	But, it is impossible. I will be the laughingstock of the musical world! People will say -
F	KANE	If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit. The newspapers, for instance. I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco... It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason. Aren't you, maestro?
M	MATISTI	Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
F	KANE	You can't.
F	KANE	I knew you'd see it my way.
M	THE VOICE	- really pathetic.
F	SUSAN	You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous? What about me? I'm the one that has to do the singing. I'm the one that gets the razzberries. Last week, when I was shopping, one of the salesgirls did an imitation of me for another girl. She thought I didn't see her, but - Charlie, you might as well make up your mind to it. This is one thing you're not going to have your own way about. I can't sing and you know it - Why can't you just -
F	KANE	My reasons satisfy me, Susan. You seem unable to understand them. I will not tell them to you again. You will continue with your singing.
M	KANE'S VOICE	Let's have your keys, Raymond.
M	RAYMOND'S VOICE	Yes, sir.
M	KANE'S VOICE	The key must be in the other side. We'll knock the door down, Raymond.
M	RAYMOND'S VOICE	Mrs. Kane -
M	KANE'S VOICE	Do what I say.
F	KANE	Get Dr. Corey.
M	RAYMOND	Yes, sir.
M	DR. COREY	She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane.
M	DR. COREY	The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad - I shall be here in the morning.
F	KANE	Thank you. I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake. The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
M	DR. COREY	I'm sure that's it.
F	KANE	There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
M	DR. COREY	Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
F	KANE	Of course.
F	SUSAN	I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie. I just couldn't - I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you. They just -
F	KANE	That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
F	KANE	I'm sorry. You won't have to fight them anymore. It's their loss.
F	SUSAN	What time is it?
F	SUSAN	Charlie! I said, what time is it?
F	KANE	Half past eleven.
F	SUSAN	I mean in New York.
F	KANE	Half past eleven.
F	SUSAN	At night?
F	KANE	Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.
F	SUSAN	Hurray for the bulldog! Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. People are going to night clubs and restaurants. Of course, we're different. We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
F	KANE	You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
F	SUSAN	Can't we go back, Charlie?
F	SUSAN	Charlie -
F	SUSAN	If I promise to be a good girl! Not to drink - and to entertain all the governors and the senators with dignity - Charlie -
F	KANE	One thing I've never been able to understand, Susan. How do you know you haven't done them before?
F	SUSAN	It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
F	KANE	You may be right - I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
F	SUSAN	It's not a habit. I do it because I like it.
F	KANE	I was referring to myself. I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight. Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
F	SUSAN	Invite everybody! Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents! Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
F	KANE	I thought we might invite everybody to go on a picnic tomorrow. Stay at Everglades overnight. Please see that the arrangements are made, Susan.
F	KANE	You remember my son, Mr. Bernstein.
M	BERNSTEIN'S VOICE	Oh, yes. How do you do, Mr. Kane?
M	CHARLIE JR.'S VOICE	Hello.
F	SUSAN	I'm not going to put up with it.
F	SUSAN	I mean it. Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
F	KANE	You're in a tent, darling. You're not at home. And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
F	SUSAN	I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think - - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business. You've got no right -
F	KANE	I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
F	SUSAN	Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
F	KANE	You're my wife, Susan, and -
F	SUSAN	I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be. I was once. Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
F	KANE	We can discuss all this some other time, Susan. Right now -
F	SUSAN	I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
F	KANE	As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything - I don't want anything now - except what you want.
F	SUSAN	What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
F	KANE	Susan, I really think -
F	SUSAN	Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you. What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? It's only money. It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
F	KANE	Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
F	SUSAN	Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something. You're - - it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you. No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known. Tried to bribe them!
F	KANE	Susan!
F	KANE	You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan. Whatever I do - I do - because I love you.
F	SUSAN	Love! You don't love anybody! Me or anybody else! You want to be loved - that's all you want! I'm Charles Foster Kane. Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me! Don't expect me to love you -
F	SUSAN	You - you hit me.
F	SUSAN	You'll never have another chance to hit me again. Never knew till this minute -
F	KANE	Susan, it seems to me -
F	SUSAN	Don't tell me you're sorry.
F	KANE	I'm not sorry.
F	SUSAN	I'm going to leave you.
F	KANE	No, you're not.
F	SUSAN	Yes.
M	RAYMOND	Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	All right.
F	KANE	Is Mrs. Kane -
M	RAYMOND	Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
F	SUSAN	Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie. He can get the bags.
M	MARIE	Yes, Mrs. Kane.
F	KANE	Have you gone completely crazy?
F	KANE	Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
F	SUSAN	- And left? Of course they'll hear. I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
F	KANE	I won't let you go.
F	SUSAN	You can't stop me.
F	SUSAN	Goodbye, Charlie.
F	KANE	Don't go, Susan.
F	SUSAN	Let's not start all over again, Charlie. We've said everything that can be said.
F	KANE	Susan, don't go! Susan, please!
F	KANE	You mustn't go, Susan. Everything'll be exactly the way you want it. Not the way I think you want it - by your way. Please, Susan - Susan!
F	KANE	Don't go, Susan! You mustn't go! You - you can't do this to me, Susan -
F	SUSAN	I see - it's you that this is being done to! It's not me at all. Not how I feel. Not what it means to me. I can't do this to you! Oh, yes I can.
F	SUSAN	In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
M	THOMPSON	The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
F	SUSAN	They haven't been tough on me. I just lost my money. But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
M	THOMPSON	I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
F	SUSAN	Don't you think I do? You say you're going down to Xanadu?
M	THOMPSON	Monday, with some of the boys from the office. Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff. We run a picture magazine, you know -
F	SUSAN	I know. If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond. That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him. He knows where the bodies are buried.
F	SUSAN	Well, what do you know? It's morning already. You must come around and tell me the story of your life sometime.
M	RAYMOND	Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man. He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
M	THOMPSON	Queer?
M	RAYMOND	Yeah. I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
M	RAYMOND	Mr. Charles Foster Kane announced today that Mrs. Charles Foster Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida home, under the terms of a peaceful and friendly agreement with the intention of filing suit for divorce at an early date. Mrs. Kane said that she does not intend to return to the operatic career which she gave up a few years after her marriage, at Mr. Kane's request. Signed, Charles Foster Kane.
M	RAYMOND	Exclusive for immediate transmission. Urgent priority all Kane papers.
M	FRED	Okay.
M	KATHERINE	Yes ... yes... Mrs. Tinsdall - Very well. It's the housekeeper.
M	RAYMOND	Yes?
M	KATHERINE	She says there's some sort of disturbance up in Mrs. Alexander's room. She's afraid to go in.
F	KANE	Close the door, Raymond.
M	RAYMOND	Yes, sir.
F	KANE	Lock it - and keep it locked.
F	KANE	Raymond -
M	RAYMOND	Yes, sir -
F	KANE	Keep it locked.
M	ONE OF THE WORKMEN	Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able to cement it till tommorrow. We -
M	RAYMOND	Okay.
F	KANE	Do you like poetry, Raymond?
M	RAYMOND	Can't say, sir.
F	KANE	Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
M	RAYMOND	Yes, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Not my wife - not either of them.
M	RAYMOND	Oh, yes, sir.
F	KANE	Do you know what that is?
M	RAYMOND	It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	Persia. It belonged to a king.
M	RAYMOND	How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
F	KANE	He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
M	RAYMOND	No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
F	KANE	I didn't used to be afraid of it.
F	KANE	The drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, And yet I saw many things, Seeing my glory in the days of my glory, I thought my power eternal And the days of my life Fixed surely in the years But a whisper came to me From Him who dies not. I called my tributary kings together And those who were proud rulers under me, I opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: "Take hills of gold, moutains of silver, And give me only one more day upon the earth." But they stood silent, Looking upon the ground; So that I died And Death came to sit upon my throne. O sons of men You see a stranger upon the road, You call to him and he does not step. He is your life Walking towards time, Hurrying to meet the kings of India and China. O sons of men You are caught in the web of the world And the spider Nothing waits behind it. Where are the men with towering hopes? They have changed places with owls, Owls who have lived in tombs And now inhabit a palace.
M	RAYMOND	That's the whole works, right up to date.
M	THOMPSON	Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
M	RAYMOND	Yes and no.
M	THOMPSON	Well, thanks a lot.
M	RAYMOND	See what I mean? He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him. That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything. I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor. He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out. But I knew how to take care of him.
M	RAYMOND	You can go on asking questions if you want to.
M	THOMPSON	We're leaving tonight. As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
M	RAYMOND	Allow yourself plenty of time. The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait. Not now. I can remember when they'd wait all day ... if Mr. Kane said so.
M	ASSISTANT	
M	ASSISTANT	"Nativity" - attributed to Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, cost 45,000 lira. Got that?
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	Yeah.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	All right! Next! Better get that statue over there.
M	ASSISTANT	Okay.
M	RAYMOND	What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
M	THOMPSON	Millions - if anybody wants it.
M	RAYMOND	The banks are out of luck, eh?
M	THOMPSON	Oh, I don't know. They'll clear all right.
M	ASSISTANT	"Venus," Fourth Century. Acquired 1911. Cost twenty-three thousand. Got it?
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	Okay.
M	ASSISTANT	That's a lot of money to pay for a dame without a head.
M	SECOND ASSISTANT	No. 483. One desk from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado. Value $6.00.
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	Okay.
M	SECOND ASSISTANT	We're all set to get everything. The junk as well as the art.
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	What's that?
M	RAYMOND	It's a jigsaw puzzle.
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	We got a lot of those. There's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Yeah, all in crates.
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
M	ASSISTANT	Iron stove. Estate of Mary Kane. Value $2.00.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Put it over by that statue. It'll make a good setup.
M	GIRL	Who is she anyway?
M	SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN	Venus. She always is.
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	He sure liked to collect things, didn't he?
M	RAYMOND	He went right on buying - right up to the end.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	wonder - You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
M	THOMPSON	Charles Foster Kane.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Or Rosebud? How about it, Jerry?
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts! What's Rosebud?
M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
M	THOMPSON	No, I didn't.
M	SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN	Say, what did you find out about him, anyway, Jerry?
M	THOMPSON	Not much.
M	SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN	Well, what have you been doing?
M	THOMPSON	Playing with a jigsaw puzzle - I talked to a lot of people who knew him.
M	GIRL	What do they say?
M	THOMPSON	Well - it's become a very clear picture. He was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide. He was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant - "Live and Let Live" - that was his motto. But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was. He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it. He had a gift for friendship such as few men have - he broke his oldest friend's heart like you'd throw away a cigarette you were through with. Outside of that -
M	THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN	Okay, okay.
M	GIRL	What about Rosebud? Don't you think that explains anything?
M	THOMPSON	No, I don't. Not much anway. Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life. No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.
M	THOMPSON	We'd better get along. We'll miss the train.
M	RAYMOND	Throw that junk in, too.
