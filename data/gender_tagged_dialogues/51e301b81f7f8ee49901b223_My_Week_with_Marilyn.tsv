M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	COMMENTATOR	"Returning to England are Britain's acting royalty Sir Laurence Olivier and Lady Olivier, better known as stunning Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a new string to his bow with the announcement that he is to direct and star in a screen version of Terence Rattigan's stage play The Sleeping Prince with none other than Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe. When the world's greatest actor romances the most famous woman alive, we can be sure that sparks will fly. Now, now Lady Olivier, don't worry - any romance is strictly for the camera!" As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we - We are a very long way from Hollywood.
M	KENNETH	... and this is one of Carracci's earlier works and one is able to see the emergence of his now famous Baroque style, which is clearly rooted in the tradition of high renaissance and antiquity... COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the
M	KENNETH	Colin! Come in. Have you met James and Anna? Two very brilliant pupils. He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a
M	COLIN	I'm leaving for London now, Pa.
M	KENNETH	Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear boy... He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to
M	KENNETH	I can always get you a research position at the V&A; when you've grown up a bit and got this film idea out of your system... COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into
F	JANE	Kenneth, you might have told Cook we were another two for dinner. What is everyone supposed to eat? Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling, there you are...
M	COLIN	I'm off now, Mama.
F	JANE	Off?
M	COLIN	My job interview, remember..? But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles
F	JANE	Can't you stay for dinner? There's nothing to eat but I'm sure the conversation will be charming.
M	COLIN	I don't want to be late in the morning. As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an
F	JANE	I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be a famous film director in no time. I know your father's put in a word.
M	COLIN	I wish he hadn't done that. I can manage on my own. She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks
F	JANE	I have to watch Jenkins like a hawk. One more of his murderous prunings and we'll lose the tea roses for ever. And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't
F	JANE	Now go and have a lovely time, darling. We're always here when you're ready to talk your future. COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
F	JANE	Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook and ask her how many pork chops we need for tonight. Then bring the car round. I must get to the village before the shop shuts... She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of
F	VANESSA	You're not in Mr. Perceval's diary.
M	COLIN	Larry told me to come. She pauses dubiously, then reaches for her telephone. We Yes?
F	VANESSA	I have a Mr. Colin Clark here. He says Sir Laurence sent him. She stresses the proper name in disapproval of Colin's Oh, God... not another one of Vivien's pretty boys. VANESSA looks at COLIN with amusement. His smile falters as
M	PERCEVAL	Well, what do you want?
M	COLIN	A job on your Marilyn Monroe film.
M	PERCEVAL	Oh really, what as?
M	COLIN	I want to work on the production side. He smiles with as much charm as he can muster. PERCEVAL
M	PERCEVAL	There are no jobs yet. We don't start shooting for eight weeks.
M	COLIN	May I wait?
M	PERCEVAL	What?
M	COLIN	Until there's a job.
M	PERCEVAL	For eight weeks?
M	COLIN	Something might come up. PERCEVAL is distracted as the telephone rings.
M	PERCEVAL	Terry? Larry wondered how the script was coming...
M	PERCEVAL	There are no jobs.
M	COLIN	I'll come back tomorrow morning. Just in case.
M	PERCEVAL	It's a free country. He sounds as though he rather regrets it.
F	VANESSA	Are you going to sit there all day?
M	COLIN	If I have to.
F	VANESSA	You're very determined.
M	COLIN	I'd do anything to be in the film business.
F	VANESSA	Anything?
F	VANESSA	You can start by making me a cup of tea. White, two sugars.
F	VANESSA	You can answer the telephone while I'm at lunch, if you like. She winks. COLIN grins. The phone rings. He picks it up.
M	COLIN	Laurence Olivier Productions... Is Sir Laurence there?
M	COLIN	He's at Notley until the end of the week. Can I take a message? I'll call back. No sooner has COLIN hung up than PERCEVAL appears. He
M	COLIN	Vanessa asked me to...
M	PERCEVAL	Oh, did she? Why didn't you put that call through?
M	COLIN	There didn't seem any need to bother you. But if you want me to transfer every single one... PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly.
M	PERCEVAL	Use your judgement. He hesitates and looks back.
M	PERCEVAL (CONT'D)	I need a number for Noel Coward. It won't be in the book, so you'll have to track him down. COLIN realises this is a test. He thinks quickly. Hello, Mama.
F	JANE	Colin, darling! How are you getting on? This is urgent. I need Noel Coward's London number. My life depends on it.
F	JANE	How exciting. Let me see... it's Sloane 2965. Ask him if he's coming to Saltwood for the bank holiday.
M	COLIN	I will. Mama, you're an angel.
M	PERCEVAL	That was quick.
M	COLIN	I had a bit of luck. PERCEVAL looks at him shrewdly.
M	PERCEVAL	Am I supposed to be impressed? Did Mummy and Daddy help? Don't think they can do the job for you. The only way you'll get on in this business is through bloody hard work.
M	COLIN	Yes, sir. COLIN leaves. He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR
M	OLIVIER	Do you know, Hughie, it is simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on the telephone? The darling girl spends the entire day asleep. But great beauty has its way... He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Hello, boy... remind me? He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.
F	VIVIEN	You remember Colin, darling. You met him at the Clarks' party. Of course. What are you doing here?
M	COLIN	You said there might be a job on your film. OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his
M	OLIVIER	Have a cigarette. Keep the pack. He turns quickly to PERCEVAL. There won't be any film unless Miss Monroe gets her splendid posterior out of bed.
M	PERCEVAL	The House Committee are threatening to withhold Miller's passport. They say he's a communist. No Arthur, no Marilyn.
M	OLIVIER	I'll have a word with the American ambassador. I'm taking him to see Vivien in South Sea Bubble on Thursday... now, tell me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites in? He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they
F	VIVIEN	They named them after Larry. The first actor since Du Maurier to have his own brand and they pay him an absolute fortune. (Pause) I'm afraid they're rather ghastly. She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D)	Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?
F	VANESSA	I suppose he's all right. VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a Let's elope together and have the most glorious affair. (Arch) Oh, but then, who'd look after my poor Larry? Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation.
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D)	Now, darling, you must do something for Colin. You absolutely promised. OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back
M	OLIVIER	Let's try to find him something to do, Hughie. COLIN grins in triumph. VIVIEN smiles at him.
F	VIVIEN	You will take care of my precious Larrykins, won't you? She flirtatiously offers up her cheek for COLIN to kiss.
M	PERCEVAL	Arthur Jacobs, Miss Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow. He wants to see the house she'll be staying in. Find something suitable. COLIN knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up, It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches, Larry says he particularly likes this dress. She looks radiant.
M	CARDIFF	Exactly - we need to tone her down a bit.
M	PERCEVAL	How the hell do you tone down Marilyn Monroe?! COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to
M	PERCEVAL	Marilyn Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow. He wants to see the house she'll be staying in. Find something suitable. COLIN nods eagerly, anxious to get out. He is already at the
M	PERCEVAL	And leave the bloody tea. COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it
M	COTES-PREEDY	Out of the question. I can't have a lot of awful film people tramping through the house in dirty boots.
M	COLIN	We'd pay a hundred pounds per week for 18 weeks.
M	COTES-PREEDY	My wife would never agree.
M	COLIN	That's a pity. I'll have to tell Miss Monroe to look elsewhere, then. COTES-PREEDY double takes.
M	COTES-PREEDY	Marilyn Monroe? She's making a film with Sir Laurence Olivier. The Sleeping Prince. From the play by Terence Rattigan.
M	COTES-PREEDY	I saw it in the West End a couple of years ago. Vivien Leigh was marvellous.
M	COLIN	It's Marilyn Monroe in the film. COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently.
M	COTES-PREEDY	I suppose I'd have to be introduced..?
M	COLIN	Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope you had a pleasant flight.
M	JACOBS	Where's the fucking car?
M	JACOBS	Jeez, do you Brits actually read this stuff? He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot COLIN gapes in astonishment. Welcome to Hollywood.
M	JACOBS	What is this place? A brothel? COTES-PREEDY's face falls.
M	COTES-PREEDY	It's one of the best houses in the area.
M	JACOBS	Jesus. And I thought you Brits had taste.
M	JACOBS (CONT'D)	Is this the best you can do?
M	COLIN	It's very near Pinewood.
M	JACOBS	But ditch the wallpaper. It's given me a migraine.
M	OLIVIER	News travels fast.
M	JACOBS	That house was perfect for Marilyn.
M	PERCEVAL	We can't use it now.
M	COLIN	Yes we can. I knew Cotes-Preedy wouldn't be able to keep this quiet. They stare to him in surprise. He looks at them boldly.
M	COLIN	When you asked me to find a house for Miss Monroe I took the precaution of finding two. The other one, Parkside, is much better and the owner is very discreet.
M	PERCEVAL	But now we have two expensive houses when we only wanted one.
M	COLIN	I thought someone else on the production might want it.
M	PERCEVAL	Oh, did you? There is a dangerous moment when things could go either
M	JACOBS	I guess Milton could use it. It's near the studio, near Marilyn. OLIVIER looks at COLIN, then bursts out laughing.
M	OLIVIER	What are we paying you, boy? He glances at COLIN with amusement.
M	COLIN	Nothing... See to it, Hughie! PERCEVAL sighs grimly.
M	COLIN	Colin Clark. Sir Laurence Olivier Productions.
M	PERCEVAL	The set decorators will have it all sorted out in no time.
M	JACOBS	Marilyn hates red. And blue. (Pause) And green.
M	PERCEVAL	What about white?
M	JACOBS	I'd have to clear it with her. OLIVIER glances mischievously at Colin.
M	OLIVIER	Beige, then. Beige is rarely controversial. JACOBS considers this, unaware that Olivier is teasing him.
M	JACOBS	I guess that's okay. She's never said nothing about beige. Paula will need the room next door.
M	COLIN	Paula?
M	JACOBS	Strasberg. Marilyn's acting coach. OLIVIER looks at him darkly. JACOBS shrugs.
M	JACOBS (CONT'D)	She's nuts about the Method.
M	OLIVIER	Stanislavski and the Method are perfectly fine in the rehearsal room but they don't belong on a film set. Time is too tight. I'm sure Marilyn understands. He turns and walks away. JACOBS frowns uncertainly.
M	JACOBS	Who the hell is this Commie Stan Slavski?
M	ORTON	I don't know why Hugh Perceval sent you here. There's nothing I can do for you.
M	COLIN	Why not?
M	ORTON	Are you in the union?
M	COLIN	No...
M	ORTON	Then you can't have a job on the film.
M	COLIN	How do I get in the union?
M	ORTON	By getting a job on the film.
M	COLIN	But you just said I couldn't have a job on the film unless I was in the union.
M	ORTON	Exactly. It's called a closed shop. COLIN looks at him helplessly. ORTON relents a little.
M	ORTON (CONT'D)	I suppose I might be able to sort something out. The Union owes me a few favours. We haven't got a third yet.
M	COLIN	A third?
M	ORTON	You do know what the job is?
M	COLIN	Assisting the director?
M	ORTON	Christ, no! That's the last thing you do. Lesson One. The third's job is to do whatever the fuck I tell him. ORTON walks to the door, then looks back. What are you waiting for? COLIN scrambles to follow him out.
M	ORTON	Colin! COLIN jumps as ORTON glowers at him.
M	ORTON (CONT'D)	Lesson Two. You don't shit on your own doorstep. Got it?
M	COLIN	Got it. But he sneaks a look back at LUCY as he goes.
M	ORTON	Where are you staying?
M	COLIN	My father's place in the Albany.
M	ORTON	You can forget that. Lesson Three. The Third always stays nearby, not in some bloody palace in London. (Pause) Book a room at the Dog And Duck down the road. It's a bit rough but you'll get used to it. He grins, enjoying himself.
M	ORTON (CONT'D)	Now make yourself useful. Marilyn needs a bodyguard. Sort something out.
M	PERCEVAL	I'm sure you understand the sensitive nature of the job, Superintendant?
M	ROGER	No need for the title. I'm retired from the force. (Pause) Something about looking after a cinema actress?
M	PERCEVAL	Not just any actress. Marilyn Monroe. He gets no reaction from the stolid ex-policeman.
M	ROGER	I've never had much time for the pictures.
M	PERCEVAL	four months you never leave her side, day or night. There will be crowds.
M	ROGER	That doesn't bother me. PERCEVAL pauses awkwardly.
M	PERCEVAL	Her behaviour is reputedly a little... erratic.
M	ROGER	She drinks?
M	PERCEVAL	Amongst other things.
M	ROGER	Pills? PERCEVAL leaves a tactful pause.
M	PERCEVAL	It would be useful if you could keep us informed of her... domestic situation.
M	ROGER	You want me to spy on her? Perceval and Roger understand each other perfectly.
M	PERCEVAL	Just the odd early warning if you know she's going to be late on set. That kind of thing. Smith takes this in his stride; he seems wholly immune to
M	JACOBS	You need to speak to the Coca-Cola people, Larry. They're crazy to be involved with Marilyn. PERCEVAL and COLIN meet them coming the other way.
M	PERCEVAL	Good news. The House Committee have decided Miller isn't a communist after all.
M	JACOBS	Of course he is. All those pain in the ass New York intellectuals are reds. OLIVIER rolls his eyes behind JACOBS back. COLIN grins.
M	PERCEVAL	It means Marilyn will be flying in next week on schedule.
M	JACOBS	She'll have to be met.
M	OLIVIER	Naturally, Vivien and I will be there to greet her. But let's keep it low key, shall we?
M	JACOBS	Don't worry. I've got it all under control.
M	OLIVIER	It is a deep happiness to me to be translating Terence Rattigan's magnificent play to the screen... A voice suddenly rings out from the back of the previously
M	REPORTER	The plane's landed! As one, the entire crowd turns away from Olivier and rushes
F	VIVIEN	It seems we're not top of the bill anymore, darling.
M	REPORTER	There she is! Marilyn! The REPORTERS surge forward. COLIN follows their collective
M	REPORTER (CONT'D)	Marilyn! Over here, Marilyn!
M	REPORTER 2	Marilyn, this way..! ARTHUR JACOBS observes the chaotic scenes with obvious
M	JACOBS	Beautiful. You're looking at tomorrow's front page, boys. ROGER looks at COLIN.
M	ROGER	We have to get them to the hall. COLIN barges his way through the scrum behind ROGER and OLIVIER smiles as he addresses the crowd.
M	OLIVIER	It's my genuine pleasure to introduce a woman who needs no introduction.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	A great actress on her first trip to London whom I have no doubt...
M	REPORTER	How do you like being married, Marilyn?
F	MARILYN	I like it a lot.
M	REPORTER	Is this third time lucky?
F	MARILYN	You bet it is. Arthur's the greatest man I ever met. OLIVIER smiles tolerantly, mildly put out at this. MARILYN
M	REPORTER	Marilyn, are you planning to see the sights?
F	MARILYN	I'd love to see the little fellow with the bow and arrow in Piccadilly Circus. There is a appreciative laughter from reporters.
M	REPORTER 2	Is it true you want to be a classical actor now?
F	MARILYN	I want to be the best actress I can be.
M	REPORTER 2	There's a rumour you're going to be in The Brothers Karamazov on Broadway.
F	MARILYN	I'm considering it. Which of them will you be playing? The agenda is clear - Marilyn is the dumb blonde and should
F	MARILYN	I'll be playing Grushenka.
M	REPORTER 3	Can you spell that?
F	MARILYN	Sure. Can you? There is laughter at the reporter's expense.
M	REPORTER	So would you say you're an intellectual now?
F	MARILYN	My husband is. She looks adoringly at Miller, who smiles vaguely.
M	REPORTER 2	What's your definition of an intellectual, Marilyn?
F	MARILYN	I guess you could look it up in a dictionary. This time the laughter is emphatically on MARILYN's side.
M	REPORTER	Vivien, you created the part of Elsie Marina on stage. Do you have any advice for Marilyn?
F	VIVIEN	I am sure if Miss Monroe needs any advice she'll get it from her director. I hear he's terribly good. The reporters laugh with her and OLIVIER smiles graciously.
M	OLIVIER	In The Sleeping Prince we have discovered the perfect vehicle for Miss Monroe's luminous and justly celebrated talent... He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him.
M	JACOBS	Marilyn, is it true you wear nothing in bed except Chanel No
F	MARILYN	As I'm in England let's say I sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender.
F	VIVIEN	Are all your press conferences like that, darling?
F	MARILYN	Well, that was quieter than some. Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the
M	JACOBS	Okay, let's get a snap of the newlyweds. Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad. As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark-
M	MILTON	This is some place you found. He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously.
M	OLIVIER	You have my new assistant Colin to thank for that. (Pause, he shepherds COLIN over) This is Milton Greene. You must be very nice to him. He owns half of Marilyn Monroe Productions.
M	MILTON	Forty nine per cent, Larry. GREENE (34) offers them a tired smile.
M	OLIVIER	Have a cigarette.
M	MILTON	I don't smoke. If he notices the "Olivier" name he doesn't show it.
M	OLIVIER	Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals. Let's talk.
M	MILTON	Sure. And the studio wants a new title. OLIVIER escorts Milton away. MILLER and MARILYN are now being photographed on their own.
M	JACOBS	The boys at the gate are getting restless.
M	MILLER	Let's give them two minutes and then we're done. ROGER waves to the POLICEMEN, who open the gates. The PRESS
F	VIVIEN	Marvellous, isn't she? I suppose you're quite smitten. COLIN looks at her shrewdly, sensing he is being tested.
M	COLIN	She's all right. A bit common. Larry fell desperately in love with her in New York. He's determined to seduce her.
M	COLIN	But she's only been married three weeks.
F	VIVIEN	Oh, Colin, I thought you were a man of the world. She gives him an arch smile and leans in intimately.
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)	Of course, Larry would never leave me. (Pause) But, if anything were to happen, you would let me know, wouldn't you?
M	COLIN	I'm sure he loves you very much. There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression.
F	VIVIEN	Oh, don't be such a boy! COLIN looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition.
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D)	At least you still adore me, don't you?
M	COLIN	Of course. Everyone does. There is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second.
F	VIVIEN	I'm 43, darling. No one will love me for much longer. Not even you. He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his
M	COLIN	Colin Clark. I booked a room. BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it
M	BARRY	What brings you up this way?
M	COLIN	I'm here working on a film. The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.
M	BARRY	What film's that?
M	COLIN	It's called `The Sleeping Prince'. The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains
M	ANDY	Sounds lousy.
M	BARRY	Ignore, Andy - not a film fan - are you, Andy? ANDY doesn't look away from his game.
M	ANDY	Can't be bothered. COLIN tries to impress.
M	COLIN	Marilyn Monroe's in it. I'll be working with her.
M	BARRY	Oh, will you now? The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't
M	ANDY	The Queen and Prince Philip popped in for a pint earlier. Pity, you just missed them. There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS.
M	BARRY	The room's three quid a week, first week in advance. You're in number two. COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with
M	BARRY (CONT'D)	You'll be sharing with Grace Kelly. The LOCALS laugh into their beer. COLIN smiles gamely.
M	WATTIS	What a wonderful adventure, Dame Sybil.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	Such a lark! I long to see her. COLIN stands by the door. OLIVIER looks at his watch and
M	COLIN	Miss Monroe? The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Sir Laurence sends his compliments. He's ready for the
M	READTHROUGH	He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the
F	PAULA	But Marilyn is not ready. She's preparing. MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with
F	MARILYN	Excuse the horrible face. She finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on.
M	OLIVIER	Marilyn, here you are, everyone is so excited to meet you... He gestures to the company.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Let us begin. Do sit down, please... SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	How lovely you are. Here, I kept a place for you. PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an
F	PAULA	I have to be next to Marilyn! The startled WATTIS gets up graciously and troops all the way Don't worry, dear, we won't bite. PAULA looks at her in truculent apology.
F	PAULA	She likes me by her side.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	What a good idea! I wish we could all bring a friend. One does get so terribly nervous. It's just like the first day at school, isn't it?
M	OLIVIER	Welcome dear Marilyn, to our little fraternity. (Pause, looks around) We may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first, but I hope that in time you may come to find your method in our madness. Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	So. My very noble and approv'd good masters, let us now embark on our great voyage of discovery together. (Pause) With boldness and (we pray) good fortune, may we strive to create a work of art that, led by your good graces, will be cherished as long as motion pictures may be remembered. He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes "Were you surprised to get my invitation?" MARILYN stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly.
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"I'll say I was surprised. I was so surprised I couldn't hardly think you meant me."
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"oh but of course I meant you. I had your name most carefully marked down on my programme. In matters of this kind I assure you I am most methodical. Who did you think I meant if not you?" MARILYN drops out of character with a sweet, nervous smile.
F	MARILYN	Gee, Mister Sir, I could listen to your accent all day. There are private grins amongst the actors. OLIVIER smiles
M	OLIVIER	You are amongst friends, my darling angel. Just plain Larry will suffice. (Pause) When you're ready..? Flustered, MARILYN looks at her script.
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"Well, Maisie Springfield...
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"Oh, no, no, no not Maisie Springfield, she's quite what I would call old hat... PAULA leans across, mounting a whispered running commentary
F	PAULA	Remember why you're in the embassy, Marilyn. What does the Grand Duke want from Elsie? She thought there were going to be a lot of people here and it's just her. OLIVIER waits patiently.
M	OLIVIER	It's your line, Marilyn.
F	MARILYN	Oh, let's see... "Oh, and am I what you'd call new hat?"
F	PAULA	Locate the experience, Marilyn. Look for the memory that helps you. Remember when you went to that party at Chaplin's house and you were the only guest? How did that make you feel? This time OLIVIER stares at PAULA.
M	OLIVIER	It is only a readthrough, Paula.
F	PAULA	Marilyn has to begin finding the character.
M	OLIVIER	The character is on the page.
F	PAULA	The words, maybe. Not the character. RICHARD WATTIS whispers to PAUL HARDWICK.
M	WATTIS	She's half cut! DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns with regal disapproval and
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	Aren't we going to have fun?
M	OLIVIER	We can't have two fucking directors!
M	MILTON	Marilyn wants Paula.
M	OLIVIER	Why? She's got me!
M	MILTON	Paula is costing us two and half thousand bucks a week. We might as well use her. (Pause) Listen Larry, accept Marilyn on her own terms and you'll be okay.
M	MILTON (CONT'D)	Try to change her and she'll drive you crazy. Trust me.
M	OLIVIER	Dear Christ, what have I got myself into?
M	COLIN	Come out with me tonight.
F	LUCY	I'm working.
M	COLIN	Tomorrow night, then.
F	LUCY	I'm washing my hair.
M	COLIN	Your hair's lovely. She stops to look at him, attracted but cautious.
F	LUCY	Look, I have two rules. One, never touch the talent...
M	COLIN	Everyone has a lot of rules around here.
F	LUCY	... and two, never go out with thirds.
M	COLIN	Why not?
F	LUCY	Because they're all randy little buggers who just want some fun during shooting.
M	COLIN	I'm not like that. She looks at him sceptically.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Really. I'm free on Saturday. Colin! COLIN ducks into a rack of clothes, making a face at Lucy.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	How kind of you to meet us. Dear me, you do look cold.
M	COLIN	They're ready for you in make-up Dame Sybil.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	How exciting! Don't you love the first day of a new production?
M	COLIN	I don't know, Dame Sybil. I've never had one before. DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	Oh, to be young again! She blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate.
M	OLIVIER	Marilyn here yet?
M	COLIN	Not yet.
M	ORTON	What the fuck's going on? I thought you had a contact in her house.
M	COLIN	I do...
M	ORTON	Well bloody use him, then.
M	ROGER	She hasn't come down yet. Neither has Miller. They're playing trains. COLIN stares at him blankly. COLIN, ROGER and MILTON sit in silence, studiously avoiding Well? What's happening? COLIN glances upstairs as he tries to think what to say.
M	COLIN	She's... getting into character.
M	OLIVIER	She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike waiting in full costume for two hours. It's simply not fair. The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	What's wrong?
F	PAULA	She wasn't happy with her make- up. OLIVIER loosens his collar irritably and glances at ORTON.
M	OLIVIER	Right, Mr. Orton you wanted me to check the back projection. Please join us, Mr. Cardiff. He stalks away, followed by Cardiff and Orton.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	Isn't she pretty though?
M	COLIN	Would you like to sit down, Dame Sybil?
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	How kind of you, Colin. Yes, why don't we all sit down? Colin sees her chair by the camera and goes innocently to
M	TREVOR	Are you a member of NATTKE?
M	COLIN	What?
M	TREVOR	That chair is a prop. Props are NATTKE. If ACT members are going to do NATTKE jobs, I'm calling my men out. Every eye is suddenly on Colin. Taking his shock for
M	TREVOR (CONT'D)	Strike meeting! Half the crew immediately down tools. COLIN looks on in
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	I'm sure we're all good union members here. There's no need to fall out over something so trivial.
M	TREVOR	It might be trivial to you, Dame Sybil, but it's my livelihood. He's not in the union. (Pause, to Colin) Put the chair down. COLIN stares at him, frozen.
M	TREVOR (CONT'D)	Put the chair down now! COLIN drops it as though it was on fire. It clatters to the
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	I rather think you've made your point. Solidarity is the important thing here. When unions fall out, it's only management that benefits. TREVOR pauses, not at all sure about this, but then shrugs If I see you doing a NATTKE job again I'll close this set down quicker than you can blink. He turns to one of his men.
M	TREVOR (CONT'D)	Dave, Dame Sybil needs a chair.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	I was on the picket lines in 1926, you know. Now that was a strike. We were all Bolsheviks then! She smiles nostalgically as ORTON appears to hustle COLIN
M	ORTON	Didn't they teach you anything at Eton? Now fuck off and see if you can get me a bacon sandwich without starting World War III.
M	DENYS	Camera running.
M	ORTON	Very quiet, everyone...
M	DENYS	Speed. The CLAPPER LOADER clicks the clapperboard.
M	CLAPPERBOY	Twenty two, take one.
M	ORTON	Action! "Now, before you meet my mother- in-law I must warn you she is a little vague and can be very deaf... on occasions." SYBIL THORNDIKE sweeps through the door right on cue, with
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)	"My dear, such boredom! The decorations hideous, and the music... catastrophe! Our friend, the ex-King of Moravia drove me home. He is now called the Duke of Strelitz, he cannot of course go to the Abbey tomorrow, but he is most anxious you should invite him to the room you have taken in the Ritz for Nicky. Maud?
M	ROSAMUND GREENWOOD (AS MAUD)	"Yes, Ma'am..."
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)	"Oh there you are my dear, I did not see you, give me a glass of that champagne I see over there. Olga Bosnia..."
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"Might I present Miss Elsie Marina?"
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)	"Oh yes, my dear, of course I remember you well." They all look at MARILYN... and nothing happens.
F	MARILYN	Gee. I forgot my line. I'm sorry.
M	OLIVIER	Cut. SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles cheerfully.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	It's so easily done, isn't it? I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there too. Shall we have another go, Larry?
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)	"Oh yes, my dear, of course I remember you well." "Oh, I'm quite sure you don't, your royal..., oh, I mean, your, uh, Imperial... your uh... serene majesty." It is not clear whether Marilyn's hesitance is acted or not "What does she say?"
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"She says she is deeply flattered and compliments you on your wonderful memory." MARILYN jumps in, shouting her line over the top of him.
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue." There is a pause. SYBIL THORNDIKE hesitates.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	Didn't I have a line somewhere there, dear?
M	OLIVIER	Cut.
M	ORTON	Action!
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER)	"Thank you, my dear. (Pause) Sweetly pretty. She should use more mascara. When one is young one should use a lot of mascara, and when one is old one should use much more. What do you do, my dear?"
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue". "Dear?"
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"She says she is an actress." MARILYN looks at him, hesitant but just about in character.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Cut it there.
M	ORTON	Check the gate.
M	FOCUS PULLER	Gate's good.
M	OLIVIER	Print. There is a near-audible sigh of relief around the set.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	That was perfect, Marilyn. You're Elsie to the life! MARILYN smiles awkwardly, not really believing her but Perhaps we could practise our lines together later? You'd be doing me such a kindness. At my great age it's just so hard to make them stick! Why don't you come for tea tomorrow? In fact Sybil is word perfect every time, and everyone
F	MARILYN	Can I?
M	OLIVIER	She's impossible. I should have cast Vivien.
M	COLIN	If anyone can make her great, it's you. You're a genius.
M	OLIVIER	Oh, yes. The world's greatest living actor, so they say. OLIVIER looks at him, wanting to be reassured. He fumbles Let's hope I'm as brilliant as you think I am. (Pause) Now be a good boy and keep an eye on her.
F	MARILYN	I just can't figure this movie out.
F	PAULA	You were wonderful. You are the most gifted actress I have ever known. You were superb, Marilyn. You were divine.
F	MARILYN	He was angry with me, I could tell.
F	PAULA	You were great. You are a great, great actress. All my life I have prayed for a great actress I could help and guide. She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the
M	PAULA (CONT'D)	Like this. I prayed to God on my knees. And he has given me you. You are that great actress, Marilyn.
F	MARILYN	Come on, Paula, get up.
F	PAULA	Not until you admit you were great. MARILYN smiles, her mood slowly lightening.
F	MARILYN	Oh, okay. I guess I was. COLIN glances at her, seeing his chance to help.
M	COLIN	You really were very good, Miss Monroe. MARILYN smiles vaguely. PAULA gives him a fierce look - COLIN
F	LUCY	Are you sure you can afford all this?
M	COLIN	Oh, it's all right.
F	LUCY	It must be costing a week's wages.
M	COLIN	It's worth it. LUCY can't help being charmed.
F	LUCY	You're not the average third, are you? Most of them would be happy with a swift half and a grope in the pub car park.
M	COLIN	I'm not living off my parents, if that's what you mean. I want to make my own way, no matter what.
F	LUCY	By making eyes at Vivien Leigh?
M	COLIN	Who told you that?
F	LUCY	Word gets around.
M	COLIN	Vivien's a friend of my father's.
F	LUCY	So there's nothing in it? You and Vivien? He smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her. She avoids
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	I'm not that easy. The WAITER approaches with a bill on a silver salver and
M	WAITER	You'll be signing on your father's account, sir? COLIN blushes violently.
M	COLIN	Certainly not. I settle my own bills. The WAITER nods discreetly and leaves. LUCY looks at COLIN
M	COLIN	I was always going to pay, you know.
F	LUCY	Of course you were. He looks at her, but there is no hint of mockery in her smile
F	LUCY	Do you think Marilyn is beautiful?
M	COLIN	Not compared to you. LUCY laughs, COLIN looks hurt.
F	LUCY	You don't have to try so hard to be charming. You're nice enough as it is. Well, you could be.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	You know Marilyn's really still in love with Joe DiMaggio?
M	COLIN	So they say.
F	LUCY	She married Miller on the rebound. The papers are calling them "The Hourglass and the Egghead".
M	COLIN	Which one is which? She bursts out laughing. Her eyes sparkle and she looks
F	LUCY	Wait a while, crocodile.
M	COLIN	I really do like you, Lucy. She looks at him shrewdly.
F	LUCY	Maybe. She hears heavy footsteps in the bedroom above.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	That's my dad. She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies
M	MR. ARMSTRONG	Time to be thinking about bed, darling. Early start tomorrow.
F	LUCY	Sorry, Daddy. We were just going over tomorrow's schedule. COLIN and LUCY share a small, private smile. He takes his cue
M	COLIN	Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong. He offers the surprised MR. ARMSTRONG a confident handshake.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	This is a very nice house you've got.
M	MR. ARMSTRONG	Do you know this part of the world? Umm... not really. My family are more country people. Lost for words they stare at each other for another moment
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Next Saturday? She nods. He follows her out into the hall.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	Colin, dear, I thought you looked cold so I bought you this. She hands him a bright red woollen scarf. COLIN is touched.
M	COLIN	Thank you, Dame Sybil.
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	Film sets and rehearsal rooms are the coldest places on earth. He smiles as her car drives away. He wraps the scarf around
M	OLIVIER	She should be on time, like everyone else.
M	MILTON	She is a star.
M	OLIVIER	I'm a fucking star! He looks around in frustration.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	If we nip this behaviour in the bud perhaps it won't be repeated.
M	MILTON	This is Marilyn you're talking about.
M	OLIVIER	Marilyn, darling you are an angel, and I kiss the hem of your garment, but why can't you get here on time for the love of fuck?
F	MARILYN	Oh... you have that word in England too? She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite
F	PAULA	Marilyn has to prepare properly. She has to find in herself all that lies under the surface. Acting isn't just a case of putting on a costume or some ludicrous false nose. OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's
M	OLIVIER	MARILYN reddens with humiliation as he takes her arm.
F	MARILYN	I'm sorry...
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	My dear, you mustn't concern yourself. A great actress like you has many other things on her mind. A radiant smile spreads slowly across Marilyn's face as the
F	MARILYN	You think I'm a great actress?
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	None of the rest of us truly know how to act for the camera. But you do. It is a rare gift. She looks sharply at OLIVIER. This poor girl hasn't had your years of experience. She is in a strange country, acting a strange part. Now, are you helping or bullying? OLIVIER looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked. COLIN
M	MILLER	That one's pretty damn good. You knocked it out of the park. MARILYN glows at his praise.
M	MILTON	When Marilyn gets it right you just don't want to look at anyone else. OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches
M	OLIVIER	We've only been shooting for four days and we're already two weeks behind. COLIN can't resist blurting out a comment.
M	COLIN	Why not only show her the good takes? Then she might feel better about herself. He looks self-conscious as they both turn to stare at him.
M	MILTON	The kid's right. She could use the confidence.
M	OLIVIER	I believe it's traditional for the producer of the film to watch rushes. Besides, she's an experienced actress. She should learn from her mistakes.
M	COLIN	They just upset her.
M	OLIVIER	Not half as much as they upset me.
M	ORTON	I'll do that. You go and find Marilyn's script. She thinks she left it in her dressing room. COLIN bursts into the dressing room without knocking. And stops dead in his tracks. MARILYN stands by a chair, a towel wrapped around her head. She looks at him in astonishment. He stares back, equally astounded. He sees her script, heavily covered in handwritten notes,
M	COLIN	Your script...
F	MARILYN	I found it. Calmly she takes the towel from her hair and wraps it
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	You can go now, Colin. He hesitates a beat, surprised that she knows his name, COLIN slams the door, aghast.
M	COLIN	David wants to know if you're ready for the extras in the ballroom scene.
F	LUCY	Tell him he can start sending them up. Women first. They kiss again. He pulls away.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	I'm looking forward to Saturday. He looks at her uncertainly.
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Our date? I forgot. I can't do Saturday. Marilyn wants to go shopping.
F	LUCY	Since when do you work for her?
M	COLIN	Larry asked me to help out. She smiles sardonically, teasing him, but a little hurt.
F	LUCY	Well, of course you must do what Larry says.
M	COLIN	Next Friday instead? She shrugs in agreement.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock. He smiles, a little too glibly, and hurries away. LUCY
F	MARILYN	Gee, it's quiet.
M	COLIN	It's Saturday. Early closing. But they're expecting us. She stops to window shop. MILTON lowers his voice to COLIN.
M	MILTON	No one's recognised her.
M	COLIN	At least she can shop in peace.
M	MILTON	Marilyn's a star. Stars don't even pee alone. He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly
M	PASSER-BY	It's Marilyn Monroe! MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is
M	ROGER	My God, she'll be torn apart...
M	MILLER	Get her out of here. COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos.
M	MILTON	Jeez, Marilyn, they really fucking love you. As COLIN looks in the rear-view mirror he sees MILLER shaking
M	MILLER	Madness. Someone's going to get hurt. COLIN shifts his gaze to her in the mirror and his eyes
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it? OLIVIER looks out from behind the camera, patient and
M	OLIVIER	Cut. The line is "Gee, this is all right too, isn't it". It's a tiny word, my darling, but it matters. Let's go straight away. MARILYN smiles vaguely. HAIR and MAKE-UP rush to do last
M	DENYS	Camera running.
M	SOUNDMAN	Speed.
M	DENYS	Mark it. The clapperboard clatters down. Take two. WATTIS and
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it?"
M	OLIVIER	Cut. Nearly there, but Terry did work so very hard on this and we must try to get it right for him. Straight away, please. Take three.
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"Well, we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is... all right, isn't it?" By now there is a panic-stricken edge to her voice.
M	OLIVIER	Cut.
F	MARILYN	Can't we just drop it?
M	OLIVIER	The point is that you have already admired the downstairs hall in an earlier scene. Now you are admiring this room as well.
F	MARILYN	Oh, sure. (Pause, she looks stricken) Paula! OLIVIER looks startled. PAULA comes scurrying across.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I don't get it. He's such a strange man. I think she'd figure out he only invited her to sleep with her. The reason Marilyn can't remember the line is because she doesn't believe the situation her character is in. OLIVIER takes out all his pent-up frustration on PAULA.
M	OLIVIER	Then she should pretend to believe it. PAULA bristles at this insult to her husband's work.
F	PAULA	Pretend? We're talking about the difference between the truth and artificial crap.
M	OLIVIER	We're in absolute agreement, Paula. Acting is all about sincerity. And if you can fake that, you're off to the races. PAULA only stares at him in disgust. Thoroughly alarmed,
M	MILTON	Maybe we should try for another take. Marilyn needs time to give a great performance. You should give her as long as it takes. Chaplin took eight months to make a movie.
M	OLIVIER	Eight months of this? I'd rather kill myself. Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN
F	MARILYN	I can't do this. I can't. PAULA looks at her adamantly.
F	PAULA	You can do it. You can't fail. You will have more pain, you will suffer more but you will create. All you need is time. MARILYN looks at her, desperately wanting to believe it.
M	PAULA (CONT'D)	Remember, Marilyn, a tree is never just a tree. What kind of tree is Elsie? An elm tree? A birch tree?
M	OLIVIER	God knows, but I'm a weeping fucking willow. Think about the things you like, instead of him. Frank Sinatra. Coca Cola. Be specific. The character comes alive if you know what you're doing. MARILYN listens intently, a frown flitting across her face. Camera running, speed, mark it... Action! Take four.
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it?"
M	OLIVIER	Cut. A look of near-panic creeps into Marilyn's eyes at her
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? (Pause) Gee, this is all right too, isn't it?" There is a stunned moment. WATTIS gapes and MARILYN looks ... there is an agonising beat... ... and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Paula!
M	OLIVIER	Cut. What's the matter now? He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Forgive me, Marilyn. This is my failure, not yours. Tell me how I can help you.
F	MARILYN	I don't know who Elsie is. I can't act her if I don't know who she is!
M	OLIVIER	Elsie is all in the script
F	MARILYN	I can't find her. She's not there.
M	OLIVIER	But you have her precisely, you know her inside out. I'm in awe of your gift. We all are.
F	MARILYN	She's not real.
M	OLIVIER	Why not simply rely on your natural talents?
F	MARILYN	Are you saying I don't need to act? OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her
M	OLIVIER	Marilyn, you are the most attractive woman in the world. I'm simply suggesting you be yourself. I don't want to be myself! (Pause) I want to be an actress playing a character.
M	OLIVIER	All you have to do, dear Marilyn, is be sexy. Isn't that what you do? MARILYN flinches as though slapped. Tension ripples through
F	MARILYN	I want Lee.
M	OLIVIER	You've already got Paula, for heaven's sake. I'm the director. Speak to me.
F	PAULA	I am only Lee's representative.
M	OLIVIER	It's five in the morning in New York. OLIVIER sits brooding savagely in front of his make-up
M	OLIVIER	"O, now, for ever Farewell the tranquil mind/Farewell content/ Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars/That make ambition virtue O, farewell/Farewell..." (Pause, exasperated) Paula's not an actress. She not a director, not a teacher. Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn.
M	MILTON	It would be worse if she wasn't around.
M	OLIVIER	You know what would make Marilyn Monroe a real actor? A season in rep. They wouldn't stand for this kind of nonsense at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne.
M	MILTON	You have to be patient with her.
M	OLIVIER	Trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like teaching Urdu to a badger. MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks
M	MILTON	I better go see her. She'll need something to help her calm down. COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out.
M	OLIVIER	Pills to sleep, pills to wake up. Pills to calm her down, pills to give her energy. No wonder she's permanently ten feet underwater.
M	COLIN	Maybe she's scared.
M	OLIVIER	We're all scared. It's part of being an actor.
M	COLIN	But you have the training to deal with it. OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him.
M	OLIVIER	I wouldn't buy the little girl lost act if I were you. Though heaven knows it's tempting. He sighs wistfully.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	And I think Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing. COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	You better get over to Parkside and make sure the poor girl's all right. (Pause) And Colin? Don't forget who you work for.
M	COLIN	Are you sure they won't mind?
M	ROGER	Help yourself. They can spare it. (Pause) Marilyn's okay. She's taken some pills and gone to bed. He frowns darkly. They like to keep her doped up. It makes her easier to control.
M	COLIN	You mean Miller?
M	ROGER	The others. They're terrified their cash cow will slip away. He smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle.
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	Cheers! Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow COLIN is paralysed. A beat, then - A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall Marilyn. Come back to bed. It's not what you think. It's just a few ideas. Writer's stuff. (Pause) Bring back my book and let's get some sleep. Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it
M	COLIN	Good morning, Miss Monroe. She is hunched in the back, her hair in a scarf, her face
M	OLIVIER	It's nearly lunch time.
M	MILTON	She isn't feeling the part.
M	OLIVIER	It's a light comedy. How much feeling can it possibly require?
M	MILTON	Give her a few minutes...
M	OLIVIER	She can't hide in her bloody dressing room all day.
M	MILTON	Oh, yes she can. Go and find out what the hell's going on. COLIN knocks softly on the dressing room door. PAULA
F	PAULA	It's Colin. COLIN waits a moment then PAULA opens the door wider. Come in. Marilyn wants to see you. COLIN stares at her in surprise. COLIN comes in. The dressing room is in semi-darkness.
F	MARILYN	How old are you?
M	COLIN	
F	MARILYN	You remind us of the young king in the movie. Kind of honest and innocent. I'm not innocent. She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into
F	MARILYN	What's your job on this picture?
M	COLIN	I'm the third assistant director. Just a gopher really. Go for this, go for that...
F	MARILYN	You're Larry's assistant too. He shrugs awkwardly. What were you doing in my house last night? Did he send you?
M	COLIN	He was worried about you.
F	MARILYN	Are you spying on me?
M	COLIN	No! Of course not. Why would anyone spy on you? She sighs, and looks away.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Are you all right, Miss Monroe? He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But
F	MARILYN	Colin? Whose side are you on? COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and
M	COLIN	Yours, Miss Monroe. She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face
F	MARILYN	Call me Marilyn. He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks
M	WATTIS	Marilyn's got a new boyfriend. Larry will get jealous.
M	HARDWICK	You can say that again. He gives a camp laugh. COLIN tries to shrug it off with a
M	COLIN	Nothing happened.
M	WATTIS	You were in there for ten minutes at least. Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle.
M	COLIN	Paula was with us the whole time.
M	WATTIS	The mind boggles, dear. COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one
M	MILLER	I dreamed last night I could hear singing. And then I realised it wasn't a dream. There was a male voice choir serenading Marilyn under our window. At two in the morning. It's a circus. A freak show. OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed.
M	MILLER (CONT'D)	I'm going back to New York for a few days. I need to see my kids. I need a break.
M	OLIVIER	That won't help Marilyn.
M	MILLER	I can't help her. (Pause) You know what she loves to do most? Sleep. It's what she lives for. Sleep is her demon. He pauses for a second.
M	MILLER (CONT'D)	I've disappointed her. OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head.
M	MILLER (CONT'D)	She thought I could smash all her insecurities with one magical stroke. That I could make her a new person. He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.
M	MILLER (CONT'D)	She wants me to protect her but I can't. I can't even protect myself. (Pause) She read some notes I made. They were nothing. Just a few ideas.
M	OLIVIER	About her? He looks up and nods slowly.
M	MILLER	She took them the wrong way. He leaves a long, uneasy pause.
M	OLIVIER	But you do love her? Your new bride and all that? MILLER plays with his whisky.
M	MILLER	I can't work. I can't think. (Pause) She's devouring me. Forgotten in the shadows, COLIN listens attentively to
F	VIVIEN	Hello, Colin darling. You look like Horatio defending the bridge. Are you going to let me in?
F	VIVIEN	I hope Larry isn't making you all work too hard. I know what a dreadful slave driver he can be. She sees ORTON and takes his hands.
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D)	David, he would be lost without you.
M	ORTON	Just doing my job. Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK
F	VIVIEN	I'm getting old, Jack. I need you to work your miracles on me.
M	CARDIFF	You're more beautiful every year, Vivien. She laughs and turns to COLIN, looking at him severely.
F	VIVIEN	Now, you are looking after Larry like I told you?
M	COLIN	I'm doing my best... VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward
F	VIVIEN	Darling Marilyn! She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands.
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D)	Larry tells me you are quite, quite superb. I'm wild with jealousy.
F	MARILYN	Oh, but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage.
F	VIVIEN	But I'm too old to play her in the film. Larry was quite brutal about that. You see, the truth is all that matters to him. That's why we all admire him so very much. She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D)	Now, I must let you work. I only came to wish you good luck! Goodbye, everyone! The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more
M	VIVIEN (CONT'D)	Oh, Colin. Not you too. He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away. COLIN pushes open the door to the projection booth. The
F	VIVIEN	I didn't think she would be so beautiful. She... shines on that screen.
M	OLIVIER	You shouldn't upset yourself. You are ten times the actress she will ever be.
F	VIVIEN	If you could see yourself. The way you watch her...
M	OLIVIER	There's never been anything between Marilyn and me. She laughs hysterically.
F	VIVIEN	Only because she didn't want you.
M	OLIVIER	You're imagining things.
F	VIVIEN	Do you think I'm a fool? You didn't think the little tart could resist the great Laurence Olivier. She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred But she saw through you, didn't she darling? Take away the actor and what's left of the man? You can't even play the husband properly without a script. I hope she makes your life hell!
M	OLIVIER	Vivien..! She storms out. After a beat, COLIN tentatively enters. She hasn't been well. There was a baby... she... we... lost it... COLIN looks down awkwardly. OLIVIER sighs.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Do you have a cigarette, Colin? COLIN hurries to offer him one of his "Oliviers". OLIVIER
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Not one of those awful things. COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to Vivien's right... I did think I would fall shatteringly in love with Marilyn. What a joke. He looks at COLIN, his feelings raw and exposed.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	women you are never too old for humiliation. COLIN pours whisky for OLIVIER. MILTON comes in.
M	MILTON	Marilyn won't shoot today. She's gone back to Parkside. She's upset about Arthur leaving England.
M	OLIVIER	He's only going to visit his children.
M	MILTON	You don't leave Marilyn alone. She can't handle it. She thinks everyone's going to abandon her. The phone rings. OLIVIER picks with a sudden burst of
M	OLIVIER	Perhaps she's come back. (Into the phone) Yes? Sir Laurence? It's Roger.
M	OLIVIER	Oh, Roger. What's up? Is Colin there, Sir? He frowns and looks at COLIN in bewilderment.
M	OLIVIER	Yes, he's here. (Pause) It's for you. Puzzled, COLIN takes the phone as OLIVIER stares at him.
M	COLIN	Roger? Colin, why don't you drop by here on your way home?
M	MILTON	What the heck?
M	OLIVIER	Why is Marilyn on the phone to my third fucking assistant? COLIN looks around helplessly.
M	COLIN	Yes, I'm sure I can do that. Good. Don't tell anyone though. She hangs up.
M	OLIVIER	Well? What did she want?
M	COLIN	She wants to see me.
M	MILTON	He shouldn't be talking to her. He's just a kid. Supposing he says something? (Pause) Why the hell didn't she call me? His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast
M	OLIVIER	I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing. Don't you, Colin? There is a warning as well as approval in his tone.
M	ROGER	Miss Monroe said for you to wait. She won't be long. He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is Help yourself to a drink. COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway,
M	COLIN	I was just... checking you've got everything you need. She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away
F	MARILYN	Here, let me. She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Are you frightened of me, Colin?
M	COLIN	No.
F	MARILYN	Good. Because I like you. Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I want you to help me. Will you do that? She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself
M	COLIN	I'm only the third. Just a messenger, really.
F	MARILYN	But you know what's going on. You can see both sides of the situation. He shrugs in helpless agreement.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I want you to be honest. Tell me everything. She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Relax. I thought you weren't scared of me. (Pause) Are you hungry? I'll have them send in a tray. I'm starved. He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you at home?
M	COLIN	There's no Mrs. Colin.
F	MARILYN	So we can talk as long as we like? He nods uncertainly. She frowns.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Why is Sir Olivier so mean? He talks to me as if he's slumming.
M	COLIN	I'll tell you what's wrong. It's agony for him because he's a great actor who wants to be a film star, and agony for you because you're a film star who wants to be a great actress. And this film won't help either of you. He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She
F	MARILYN	Are you sure you can handle that? You don't look old enough to drink.
M	COLIN	I'm 23, Miss Monroe.
F	MARILYN	It's Marilyn. (Pause) I'm 30. I guess that makes me an old lady to you.
M	COLIN	Seven years is nothing. She smiles then sits opposite him.
F	MARILYN	Do you know I've been married three times already? How did that happen?
M	COLIN	You were just looking for the right man.
F	MARILYN	They always look right at the start. She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The
M	COLIN	Hello?
M	MILTON	Colin? Is everything okay? What did she want?
M	COLIN	Everything's fine. Miss Monroe just had... some large packages she needed handling... He looks at MARILYN's voluptuous figure. MARILYN looks back
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Hello? Milton? There is a long silence at the other end of the line.
M	MILTON	Let me speak to her, Colin.
M	COLIN	She's tied up right now. This only sets MARILYN off again. She howls with laughter and
M	MILTON	Let me talk to her, damn it!
M	COLIN	I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go. He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN
F	MARILYN	Let's walk in the garden. See if we can find any more reporters in the bushes. She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes
F	MARILYN	I didn't know it was so pretty out here.
M	COLIN	You should get out more. See the sights.
F	MARILYN	I am the sights. She giggles again, her mood lighter.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Look at us. We're just like Elsie and the young King. What would Sir Laurence say if he could see us now?
M	COLIN	I don't think he'd mind.
F	MARILYN	I wanted to be an artist. To grow as an actor. I was so proud to be working with the great Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks I'm the enemy. She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.
M	COLIN	He doesn't understand your kind of actor. He's hated the method ever since Vivien worked with Elia Kazan. It's all too new and strange. You're the future, and it frightens him.
F	MARILYN	Every time I walk into the studio I feel this sense of doom come over me. He looks at me like he's smelling a pile of rotten fish. And the crew hate me. Paula is the only person I can trust. (Pause) Except for you now, maybe. She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.
M	ROGER	Phone call for you, Miss Monroe. It's Mr. Miller. MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing
F	MARILYN	Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for telling me the truth. COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises
M	ROGER	You'll be leaving now, I expect. The next morning. COLIN walks in as OLIVIER is talking to
M	OLIVIER	I don't care if he fucks her sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her down. (Pause) Oh, hello, boy. He smiles cheerfully. I hear you spent last night with Marilyn.
M	COLIN	I didn't spend the night with her. We just had a chat.
M	MILTON	I heard them chuckling. OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.
M	OLIVIER	Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic Marilyn is more likely to behave herself.
M	COLIN	She just wants a chum, that's all.
M	MILTON	A chum? Jesus Christ, what is this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up, kid. He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
M	OLIVIER	I thought working with Marilyn would make me feel young again. But I look dead in the rushes. Dead behind the eyes. He gazes at himself thoughtfully.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Perhaps I'm angry with her because in my heart I know my own career is in a terrible rut. I wanted to renew myself through her but all I see reflected in that magnificent face is my own inadequacy. He leans back.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	You know, I admire Marilyn. I really do. Despite her behaviour. She has taken everything Hollywood can throw at her and triumphed. COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him. An actress has to be pretty tough to get even a tenth as far as she has. He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	But be careful, boy. She doesn't need to be rescued. Not really.
M	SOUNDMAN	What was Marilyn like then, Col?
M	HARDWICK	Going over her lines with her, were you?
M	SOUNDMAN	Will she be in today or is she too tired? It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely
M	COLIN	She was just being friendly.
M	WATTIS	I'll bet. There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner
M	WATTIS (CONT'D)	Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap? There you are, Colin the innocent little fly buzzing about happily, when suddenly a heavenly scent attracts you and - Snap!
M	COLIN	Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've never slept with a woman in your life.
M	WATTIS	I know a Femme Fatale when I see one, love.
M	ORTON	Three minutes, ladies and gents. Three minutes. It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date
M	MILTON	Arthur Miller called me. He's not happy with you.
M	COLIN	He doesn't even know who I am.
M	MILTON	Marilyn must have said something.
M	COLIN	Maybe she was trying to make him jealous... ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind
M	MILTON	Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn for seven years. I fell in love with her, just like you've done. COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him.
M	MILTON (CONT'D)	We had ten days together and that was it. She picked me up, she put me down. That's what she does. She breaks hearts. She'll break yours. My advice to you is to quit before you get burned.
M	COLIN	I don't need your advice. And I'm not in love with her.
M	MILTON	You don't see Marilyn again, you don't even talk to her. She is completely off-limits to you. Got it?
F	LUCY	I waited for you on Friday.
M	COLIN	Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot... I've just been so busy. So I hear. You know how crews gossip. There's nothing in it.
F	LUCY	Of course there isn't. Marilyn Monroe fancying you? Come on. COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.
F	MARILYN	Hi, Colin. COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns,
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Hey, are you guys dating? That's what I heard. She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing
M	COLIN	Of course not. You know how crews like to gossip. His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating
F	MARILYN	Too bad. You look cute together. She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause.
F	LUCY	I thought you were different.
M	COLIN	Lucy, I really like you. We've had such fun...
F	LUCY	And now it's time to set your sights a little higher. I get it. Cary Grant? She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe
M	ROGER	Get in. COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and
M	MILTON	Any problem, Roger?
M	ROGER	Just dropped by to take Colin out to lunch. COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his
M	MILTON	You're not taking him to Marilyn? That would drop us all in a whole ocean of shit.
M	ROGER	Oh, no, sir. MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.
M	MILTON	What do you have in there?
M	ROGER	Just a picnic. We've been looking forward to it, haven't we, Colin? COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON
M	MILTON	Okay, well, have a nice time boys. Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.
M	COLIN	Is she okay? In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the
M	COLIN	Oh, Jesus - She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.
F	MARILYN	Roger and I decided to take you out for an adventure. Didn't we Roger? Indeed we did.
M	COLIN	Oh, God. If Milton sees me with you... I'll be sacked... He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back
F	MARILYN	No one can sack you, Colin. (Pause) Except me, of course. She pats the seat next to her.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I don't like being on my own in the back. Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running
M	MILTON	What the hell? He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries Colin! Get back here, you little bastard! You're fired! Do you hear me? Fired! COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN
F	MARILYN	Do you think he saw me? COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Snuggle up. This is fun. She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches
F	MARILYN	This is how I ought to feel every day. COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Let's run away together. He turns ashen. Just kidding. She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her.
M	COLIN	We have today, anyway. One day to do whatever we like. We can go back to real life tomorrow.
F	MARILYN	Only one day?
M	COLIN	Well, maybe the weekend.
F	MARILYN	Or a week? He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his What shall we do?
M	COLIN	We could go to Windsor Castle, if you like. MARILYN's face breaks into a smile of pure delight.
M	ROGER	Detective Chief Superintendant Smith. I'm escorting this lady and gentleman for the day. They'd like to look around the castle. As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen.
M	POLICEMAN	Christ, is that..? He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles.
M	ROGER	Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors, is it?
M	POLICEMAN	Does she know anyone here, sir? We need to write down a contact name in the book. ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn.
M	ROGER	You don't know Her Majesty, by any chance?
F	MARILYN	We met at a movie premiere. She said my dress was pretty.
M	POLICEMAN	I'm not sure that quite... My Godfather works here. He's the Royal librarian, Sir Owen Morshead. The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes.
M	POLICEMAN	Name?
M	COLIN	Clark. Colin Clark. The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on My father knows everybody. A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised.
M	POLICEMAN	He says to go straight up the hill, sir. You'll be met at the door.
M	MORSHEAD	Colin, my boy! Come in, come in. Forgive the dust. He smiles at MARILYN, showing no sign whatever of
M	MORSHEAD (CONT'D)	You are pretty, my dear. I'm sure you and Colin have so much in common. MARILYN looks around in awe.
F	MARILYN	Gee, I'd love to read all these books some time.
M	MORSHEAD	Luckily one doesn't really have to. A lot of them just have pictures in. He finds a portfolio on the table and opens it.
M	MORSHEAD (CONT'D)	These are by an artist called Holbein. MARILYN smiles at a portrait of a young woman.
F	MARILYN	She's beautiful.
M	MORSHEAD	She was the daughter of one of the King's courtiers, nearly 400 years ago.
F	MARILYN	I hope I look that good when I'm MORSHEAD laughs. He takes down another folder of drawings.
M	MORSHEAD	And these are all by Leonardo Da Vinci.
F	MARILYN	I've heard of him! Didn't he paint that lady with the funny smile? She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the
M	MORSHEAD	The Mona Lisa.
F	MARILYN	Do you have that one here too?
M	MORSHEAD	Alas, that one got away. He closes the portfolio and takes MARILYN's arm briskly.
M	MORSHEAD (CONT'D)	Now, let's go to the Queen's apartments. She's not here at the moment, but she will be sorry to have missed you. MARILYN looks at him, wide-eyed.
F	MARILYN	Really?
M	MORSHEAD	Oh, yes. Why, she was only saying to me the other day, "what must it be like to be the most famous woman on earth"? He shares a sly smile with COLIN. He knows exactly who
M	MORSHEAD (CONT'D)	Some of the rooms are very opulent but I think there's something you might like better than all that.
F	MARILYN	Look, Colin. COLIN kneels at her side.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I sure never had a dolls' house like this when I was a kid. She sees a perfect doll family inside, husband, wife and
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	This is me, that's you, and these are our kids. She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Our daughter's so pretty. All little girls should be told how pretty they are. They should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them. Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	We look like such a happy family, don't we?
M	MORSHEAD	You mustn't let me keep you. I'm sure you're longing to be on your way.
F	MARILYN	Shall I be "her"? She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out,
M	SPECTATOR	Are you somebody, mate? I'm no one. COLIN stares at MARILYN. She catches his eye and smiles,
F	MARILYN	This isn't a school, it's a palace! COLIN smiles.
M	COLIN	Eton is 500 years old. It was founded by King Henry VI.
F	MARILYN	It's like walking through history.
M	COLIN	Take that room up there. They stop as COLIN points up at a window.
M	COLIN	That's where the boys were sent if they didn't work hard enough. Where we were whipped. MARILYN looks at him in shock.
F	MARILYN	Whipped?
M	COLIN	Beaten. She looks appalled.
F	MARILYN	I'd never send my kids away. (pause) How long were you here?
M	COLIN	Five years. But I was sent to boarding school when I was eight.
F	MARILYN	Why?
M	COLIN	That's what we do in my family. She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.
F	MARILYN	It seems to me that you've had most things pretty easy.
M	COLIN	In one way, yes. But when you're brought up in a house of over- achievers, it's hard to make your own mark. She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.
F	MARILYN	So how are you going to do it?
M	COLIN	Maybe it will be in films, but if not, there are so many possibilities out there.
F	MARILYN	Sounds pretty good to me. She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness. But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns
M	SCHOOLBOY	Marilyn! It's Marilyn Monroe!
F	MARILYN	Work hard, boys! I don't want anyone whipping you! A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily.
M	BOY	You can whip me anytime, Marilyn! MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN
F	MARILYN	Hurry up, slow poke.
M	COLIN	But we haven't got any... He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her
F	MARILYN	Oh my gosh! It's freezing!
F	MARILYN	This is great.
M	COLIN	What if a boat goes past? We could be arrested.
F	MARILYN	Don't worry. Roger will fix it. Oh, darn it... She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.
M	COLIN	What's wrong?
F	MARILYN	I have something in my eye. He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under
M	COLIN	I can't see anything.
F	MARILYN	Get closer. She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	That's the first time I've kissed anyone younger than me. There's a lot of older guys in Hollywood. She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self- Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing you haven't seen before. COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Oh, Colin! And you an old Etonian! He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering
M	COLIN	Let me warm you up. She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He
F	MARILYN	Don't spoil it. She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I want this to be the perfect date. He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I haven't had a real date since I was 13 years old. She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	That was nice. I don't get kissed much. She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens. Okay, what do we do now? COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the
M	ROGER	Time to go home, I think, Miss Monroe. She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him Be careful not to get in too deep, son. COLIN knows he isn't talking about the river.
F	MARILYN	Hi Milton. She smiles sweetly.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Next time I come on set, you better make sure Colin is there. He looks at her in shock then bitterly at COLIN. Take him home.
M	OLIVIER	You spent the day with her. What frame of mind was she in?
M	COLIN	She was fine. Well, find out what's going on. There's a good chap. Perhaps we can persuade her on this splendid day to do the work she's paying herself to do. He stalks off. COLIN sees WATTIS grinning at him.
M	COLIN	Don't start, Dicky.
M	WATTIS	You won't get any sympathy from me, dear. Frankly I wouldn't care if Marilyn dropped dead tomorrow.
M	COLIN	She's trying her best.
M	WATTIS	She's Marilyn Monroe. This is her life. Pills, booze, sex, more pills. (Pause) God, it must be wonderful! COLIN doesn't laugh. WATTIS looks at him sympathetically.
M	WATTIS (CONT'D)	Oh, dear. Little Colin's in love.
M	MILTON	Marilyn's not well.
M	COLIN	But she was wonderful yesterday. MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his
M	MILTON	I don't know what you did to her, kid, but she got nervous. I had to give her some pills to calm her down.
M	COLIN	She doesn't need pills! She just needs someone to care for her.
M	MILTON	Someone like you? COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly.
M	COLIN	I told you, I'm not in love with her!
M	MILTON	You kissed her.
M	COLIN	She said that?
M	MILTON	Spare me the bullshit. I know everything. COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth.
M	MILTON (CONT'D)	You messed her up, kid. Confused her. He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded.
M	MILTON (CONT'D)	I've got every penny I ever made tied up in Marilyn. She owes me. If it wasn't for me she'd still be on contracts that make slave wages look good. I gave her back her freedom, and now Miller's turning her against me. That's what you get for trying to help Marilyn Monroe. He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking If you want to play with the grown-ups, Colin, start learning the rules. Colin! (Pause) Colin! COLIN opens his eyes, his mind drugged with sleep.
M	COLIN	Roger? What's the matter? It's Marilyn. A cold dread clutches at COLIN's stomach. He stumbles out
M	COLIN	Is she dead?
M	ROGER	She's asking for you. She's sick. I think she might be in a coma.
M	COLIN	How can she be asking for me if she's in a coma?
M	ROGER	Just bloody get dressed!
F	PAULA	She hasn't made a sound for over an hour.
M	ROGER	We should break down the door.
M	COLIN	How many pills did she take?
M	MILTON	Oh, Jesus, who knows? I wasn't counting. COLIN knocks gently.
M	COLIN	Marilyn? There is no reply.
M	ROGER	That's her window. He points with his torch. The window is open. COLIN shins
M	COLIN	I'll open the door once I'm inside.
M	COLIN	Marilyn? A shaft of moonlight reveals MARILYN lying naked across the
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Marilyn? For a second he fears the worst, but then suddenly she
F	MARILYN	Oh hi, Colin.
M	COLIN	Are you okay? Everyone was worried about you.
F	MARILYN	Phooey. She pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Get in. She is instantly back asleep. COLIN fumbles his way to the
M	COLIN	It's me. She's fine but I'm going to keep an eye on her. I'll sleep on the sofa. Come on, Colin, open up.
M	COLIN	I can't find the key. (Pause) You can all go to bed now. Colin, open this door! She needs me... COLIN goes back to the bed and gazes at the sleeping
F	MARILYN	Colin? What are you doing here? MARILYN sits up, the sheet clutched to her chest, her
M	COLIN	I came in through the window... He realises this doesn't sound reassuring.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Milton thought you were sick. She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed
F	MARILYN	The window? Is there a balcony, like in Romeo And Juliet? How romantic. (Pause) But I'm not sick. What makes them think that? She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her
M	COLIN	Please don't take any more pills. She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand. He Who's that?
F	MARILYN	My mom. Her expression softens as she looks at the picture.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	They took her to the Sanatorium when I was a kid. I grew up in other people's homes, mostly. Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture,
M	COLIN	Abraham Lincoln?
F	MARILYN	I don't know who my father is so it might as well be him. Why not? I can pick any father I want. She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Do you have a home, Colin? A real one?
M	COLIN	Yes, I do.
F	MARILYN	And a mother and father who still live together?
M	COLIN	Yes.
F	MARILYN	And do they love you?
M	COLIN	I'm sure they do. He nods. She smiles sadly.
F	MARILYN	You're lucky. Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Do you love me, Colin? He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately
M	COLIN	Yes. She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	But you and I come from different worlds. You're like some Greek Goddess to me...
F	MARILYN	I'm not Greek. She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I don't want to be a Goddess. I just want to be loved like an ordinary girl.
M	COLIN	Mr. Miller loves you. She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.
F	MARILYN	I found his notebook. It said I'd let him down.
M	COLIN	Writers scribble all kinds of things. It doesn't mean anything. She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.
F	MARILYN	He wanted me to find it. It said he should never have married me. That I was unpredictable and a woman-child, flighty and self- centred. He's left me, Colin. Why do the people I love always leave me? She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN
M	COLIN	I'll never leave you. She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.
F	MARILYN	All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe. As soon as they realise I'm not her, they run. He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	Boy, there's a lot of men in this business. And they all think you've got to sleep with them. She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	You're not like that. That's why I like you. COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	You should date that Wardrobe lady. She's pretty.
M	COLIN	I don't want to. (Pause) I love you, Marilyn. She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They
F	MARILYN	What's the matter? Don't you want to make love?
M	COLIN	Maybe we should just be friends.
F	MARILYN	Okay. Friends. She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	This is nice. Like spoons. I used to do this with Johnny.
M	COLIN	Who's Johnny?
F	MARILYN	Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in the old days. He was thin, like you... Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body
M	COLIN	Marilyn? She mutters softly in reply.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Do one thing for me? Come into the studio on time tomorrow and show everybody what you can do. Show Larry you're a great actress. Okay. He smiles and turns out the light.
F	MARILYN	"I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through... I'm yours no matter what others may say or do... She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles.
M	OLIVIER	Morning, boy. (Pause) Christ, you look rough. He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Let me know when Marilyn arrives. If she ever does.
M	COLIN	Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in this morning. OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look.
M	WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)	"Your Grand Ducal Highness.."
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"This is intolerable"!
M	WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)	"With the deepest respect, sir, my message was so important I had no choice but to intrude". "Revolution?"
M	WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)	"No, sir, Miss Marina's aunt has been in a motor accident. The hospital is calling for her most urgently."
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"What? (Giggles drunkenly) Oh, go away, you silly man."
M	WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)	"Miss Marina, your aunt... you realise how serious her condition is?"
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"Well, it's her own fault. She has no right being out at this time of night. She's 93!" MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them,
M	ORTON	Cut it there! MARILYN is as happy as we have ever seen her. She seeks out OLIVIER takes off his make-up. COLIN stands behind him with
M	OLIVIER	Whatever it was you did to her, boy, keep doing it. OLIVIER grins slyly and COLIN doesn't bother to protest.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Hello? His face falls as he listens to the voice at the other end
F	PAULA	From the first moment all I have felt is Olivier's loathing and contempt. He thinks I'm unnecessary. Me, her drama coach, surrogate mother, nursemaid. On call 24 hours a day to help her act, dole out pills, bolster her ego, keep her sober enough to work. (Pause) Me. Unnecessary. (Pause) No me, no Marilyn. He is taken aback by her passion. She smiles bitterly then
M	PAULA (CONT'D)	You can come up now.
F	MARILYN	You think I can act, don't you, Colin?
M	COLIN	Of course I do. You were wonderful today. PAULA looks at MILTON, then moves between them busily.
F	PAULA	Marilyn's tired now.
F	MARILYN	I want him to stay with me.
M	MILTON	What would Arthur say if he knew Colin was here? A flicker of terror crosses MARILYN's face. COLIN turns on
M	COLIN	You heard what she said. She wants me here.
F	PAULA	You have no idea of your position in the world, Marilyn. You are the greatest actress there's ever been. Not just actress. The greatest woman of this or any time. I love you like a daughter. COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes.
M	PAULA (CONT'D)	It's hard now, but believe me you will survive this and go on to better things. Your life is ahead of you. You're young, just beginning. Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN
F	MARILYN	I'm so tired of feeling scared. Life is so shitty. I hate it. It hurts too much. COLIN looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish.
M	COLIN	I'm here now. I'll look after you. She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.
F	MARILYN	Good old Colin. Looking after me, looking after Larry, looking after Vivien. Always putting everyone before yourself. There is an edge to this. He gazes at her, shaken, but she
F	MARILYN	It hurts! It hurts, Colin! She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	The baby. I can't lose the baby. COLIN looks at her aghast.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	It's a surprise. For Arthur. Don't tell anyone. Promise me. He hurls himself off the bed and runs to the door. MILTON and COLIN wait by the bathroom in Marilyn's suite.
M	ROGER	The doctor's coming. COLIN turns the handle but the bathroom door is locked.
M	COLIN	Marilyn, unlock the door. Don't let anyone in.
M	COLIN	I won't. MILTON gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about
F	PAULA	Marilyn! Marilyn, my baby, what has Colin done to you?
M	COLIN	I haven't done anything. She's just... got a stomach ache. He reddens with embarrassment. ROGER coughs.
M	ROGER	I think he means her monthlies.
F	PAULA	What will Arthur say if she dies?
M	COLIN	She's not dying, for Christ's sake. The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man
M	CONNELL	I'm Dr. Connell. Is the patient in there?
F	PAULA	Please save her... it's Marilyn Monroe. You can't let her die. CONNELL calmly extracts himself from her grasp.
M	CONNELL	Perhaps you'd all like to give us a little privacy? As COLIN shepherds the others out MILTON turns on him
M	MILTON	Happy now, kid?
M	CONNELL	Who's in charge here? MILTON, PAULA, ROGER and COLIN all step forward as one.
M	CONNELL (CONT'D)	I've given Mrs. Miller an injection and the bleeding has stopped. She needs to stay in bed tomorrow but after that she'll be fine. I suggest someone stays with her. PAULA leans forward and almost snatches the prescription
F	PAULA	She'll be safe with me.
M	CONNELL	Well, goodnight then. COLIN holds the door open as he gets in.
M	COLIN	Was she really pregnant?
M	CONNELL	I think that's a private matter between Mr and Mrs. Miller. He looks at COLIN with cool disapproval, then closes the
F	MARILYN	We have to say goodbye now, Colin. Arthur's on his way back. When this film is over I'm going to settle down and be a good wife to him. I'm going to learn to make Matzo ball soup as good as his dad's. She smiles wistfully at the fantasy.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	We have to forget this ever happened.
M	COLIN	I don't want to forget. He struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately.
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	Let me protect you from all this... She smiles sadly.
F	MARILYN	What do you want to do? Marry me?
M	COLIN	Why not? You could come and live at my parents place. You'd love it. It's a castle, like in a fairy tale. We wouldn't even have to live together. You could have your own suite of rooms... He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	You could quit. Forget Marilyn Monroe, forget Hollywood. Let it all go.
F	MARILYN	This is what I've worked for my whole life. I couldn't just give it all up.
M	COLIN	Why not, when it drives you crazy? Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity
F	MARILYN	You think I'm crazy?
M	COLIN	I didn't mean that. I just meant you could be happy.
F	MARILYN	I am happy. I got everything I ever dreamed about. She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.
M	COLIN	You're a star. The biggest star in the world. She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and
M	COLIN (CONT'D)	You're right, Marilyn. We have to forget all this. From now on I'm nobody. Just the third. You don't even know I exist. We'll never look at each other again. She giggles with some of her old playfulness.
F	MARILYN	Well, maybe just a wink. Once in a while. He smiles, looks at her just once more, and then goes out. OLIVIER sits in front of his make-up mirror in his Grand
M	COLIN	They're ready for you on set, Sir Laurence.
M	OLIVIER	Marilyn?
M	COLIN	She's just arrived.
M	OLIVIER	Only an hour late. Not bad by her standards. He smiles, then stands up, straightening his uniform.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	Maybe we will finish this bloody film after all. MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I hope you will all forgive me. It wasn't altogether my fault. I have been ill. She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	I'd like you to remember I tried. This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence.
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"..I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, I'm yours no matter what others may say or do. Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart.." She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There
M	SYBIL THORNDIKE	First love is such sweet despair, Colin. She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a - WATTIS and JEREMY SPENSER crossing the drawing room to the - WATTIS crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door...
M	ORTON	Very quiet, studio! Going for a take. The big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy
M	DENYS	Camera running! Speed! MARILYN looks up, in character as Elsie, her eyes glowing.
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"My dear..."
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"I've got a solemn word of warning for you."
M	OLIVIER (AS REGENT)	"What's that, my beloved?"
M	MARILYN (AS ELSIE)	"You know what's going to happen? I'm going to fall in love with you, because I always, always do." CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut',
M	ORTON	Cut! Okay boys and girls, that's a wrap! There is a smattering of applause from the crew. MARILYN
M	MILTON	If you'd all like to step this way, you'll find something I think you'll like. MILTON indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio,
M	MILTON (CONT'D)	A parting gift to each of you from Marilyn. Men on the left, ladies on the right. There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers.
M	JACOBS	It's been a lot of fun, kids. See you at the Academy Awards. He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the
M	COLIN	Aren't you going to throw yours away?
F	LUCY	Of course not. It's from Marilyn Monroe. He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave.
M	COLIN	Lucy? She turns back to look at him. I was wondering if you're doing anything this Saturday.
F	LUCY	I'm washing my hair. He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	Did she break your heart?
M	COLIN	A little.
F	LUCY	Good. It needed breaking. There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that
M	LUCY (CONT'D)	I might be free on Wednesday. COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's
M	OLIVIER	"You do look, my son, in a moved sort/As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir./Our revels now are ended.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	These our actors,/As I foretold you, were all spirits and/Are melted into air, into thin air...
M	COLIN	Prospero. We are such stuff/As dreams are made on, and our little life/Is rounded with a sleep..." COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	She's quite wonderful. No training, no craft, no guile, just pure instinct. Astonishing. He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in
M	COLIN	You should tell her that.
M	OLIVIER	Oh, I will. But she won't believe me. That's probably what makes her great. It's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy. He smiles wryly. I tried my best to change her, but she remains brilliant despite me. (Pause) Directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented, but Marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again. He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the And now I'm going back to the theatre. John Osborne is writing a piece for me.
M	COLIN	I thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff. Miller made me see things differently. (Pause) You have to find new worlds to conquer, if you want to be the best. And believe me, most of the time, I really am the best. He goes to the door and pauses.
M	OLIVIER (CONT'D)	You've done a good job, boy. (Pause) Welcome to the circus. He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.
M	COLIN	Run it again, please. The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen, And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and
F	MARILYN	Buy a girl a drink? COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.
M	COLIN	Can I get another one of those please, Barry? BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not
F	MARILYN	I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.
M	MARILYN (CONT'D)	The first time you saw this, all I had on was the radio. Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the Don't forget me.
M	COLIN	As if I could.
F	MARILYN	Everyone else on the picture wishes they could.
M	COLIN	Everyone else doesn't understand. She smiles, touched.
F	MARILYN	Be a gentleman and walk me to my car? MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles
M	COLIN	What's that for?
F	MARILYN	That's for being on my side; and remember, when you see me wink, that's for you. ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.
M	ROGER	Looking a couple of inches taller than when I first saw you. ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well
M	BARRY	Was that really Marilyn Monroe?
M	COLIN	No - just a good friend of mine. BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring
M	COLIN	Any messages? THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.
M	SECRETARY	It's probably just someone having a joke. COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles
M	COLIN	Did she say anything?
M	SECRETARY	She just asked you to call. (Pause) It is a joke, isn't it? COLIN stares down at the paper.
M	COLIN	Probably. (Pause) Book a call as soon as you can. Los Angeles, California. Brentwood 1890. The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.
M	OPERATOR	Your call to Los Angeles. We hear the crackle of the international line. He waits ESTABLISH the luxurious exterior of Marilyn's comfortable The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions A white phone rings on the table. It rings continuously, insistently. It carries on ringing. No one comes. HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think "I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, I'm yours no matter what others may say or do. Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart..." The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera, Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet There is something so completely natural about the gesture It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed, She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without Beautiful, timeless - Happy.
