M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SETH	Yo.
F	EVAN	What's up?
M	SETH	I was doing research last night, for next year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang Bus.
F	EVAN	Which one's Bang Bus?
M	SETH	The one where they bang the chicks on the bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total access, live Web Cam feed. The works. It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging them myself.
F	EVAN	That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it. And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill.
M	SETH	It shows up under a different name. I hope. Bang Bus. CONTINUED: 2 That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name.
F	EVAN	Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.
M	SETH	I could tell my parents I'm doing a project on Rome and I have to research orgies.
F	EVAN	Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs.
M	EVAN'S MOM	Thanks for taking him, Seth.
M	SETH	Don't touch that!
M	EVAN'S MOM	You two are so funny. I can't imagine what you'll do without each other next year. Evan told me you didn't get into State.
M	SETH	Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good places. I think we'll be fine.
M	EVAN'S MOM	Are you going to miss each other?
F	EVAN	Miss each other? No! CONTINUED: 3
M	SETH	That's disgusting.
M	MOM	Bye, boys.
M	SETH	I am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.
F	EVAN	Fuck you, man.
F	EVAN	You're being an idiot, man. You really shouldn't park there.
M	SETH	Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate. They should be suckin' my balls. It's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life.
F	EVAN	What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
M	SETH	Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in capture the flag last week.
F	EVAN	Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate that guy. Look at those nipples.
M	SETH	They're like baby toes.
F	EVAN	It's not fair. I have to hide every erection I get.
M	SETH	Sometimes I get boners so big I can't hide them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. And it won't go away.
F	EVAN	Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit.
M	SETH	You know it's been, like, a year and a half since I've seen an actual human female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it last month, and it was sick.
F	EVAN	Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
M	SETH	Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
F	EVAN	How can that possibly suck? I'd be fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen handjobs!
M	SETH	And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early.
F	EVAN	You're like Orson Welles.
M	SETH	Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.
F	EVAN	You'll have sex in college. Everyone does. And if not, you'll have the Bang Bus.
M	SETH	But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
F	EVAN	I still think you've got a chance with Jules. She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you.
M	SETH	Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face. All of those were cool guys. She's been hot way longer than you think. Why would she end her high school career with me?
F	EVAN	Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
M	SETH	Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. You're a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. That bitch looks like a good fucker.
F	EVAN	Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!
M	SETH	What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but I can't say one thing about her?
F	EVAN	I don't constantly insult her.
M	SETH	I didn't insult her! I said she looks like a good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That's a good thing. Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities.
M	TERRY	Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big grad party?
M	SETH	No.
M	TERRY	Yeah.
M	TERRY (CONT'D)	And you're not coming. Tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either.
F	EVAN	Wow. You really bitched out on that one.
M	SETH	I bitched out? You bitched out! You were across the street before I even realized what was going on. That guy's such a douche bag. CONTINUED: 7
M	SETH	This...is...bullshit.
M	KID	Poo-say.
M	HELEN	Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.
F	EVAN	Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep it. Then you'll just have it, and you won't have to borrow another pen.
M	HELEN	Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did you hear about Terry's grad party? It's going to be so insane.
F	EVAN	Yeah, it's a maybe. But, you know, I gotta, I got my... CONTINUED: 8 there's so much other fun shit that is going to be going on that night...so, you know...
M	HELEN	Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at any parties or anything.
F	EVAN	Because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing.
M	HELEN	Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's party on Saturday?
F	EVAN	Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go, because, well, I did other stuff. Saturday... Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!
M	EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O)	First my parents went out to a double feature, so a bunch of people came over...
F	EVAN	...and we had a couple drinks in my basement...
M	EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O)	...and Seth's parents were having this cocktail party, and we went over there to, like, mingle...
F	EVAN	...and there were actually some really interesting and, like, entertaining people there...
M	EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O.)	...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live music.
F	EVAN	...then we went to a club downtown...
F	EVAN	...and then we pretty much called it a night and went home...
F	EVAN	...you would've loved it.
M	HELEN	That sounds so fun. I would love to go do something like that. CONTINUED: 14
F	EVAN	Yeah...well, you know, me and Seth are always cooking up...uh...fun little...events.
M	HELEN	So, are you guys going to the same school next year?
F	EVAN	Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got into different ones.
M	HELEN	What are you going to do without him?
F	EVAN	Same shit I've always been doing. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not.
M	SETH	Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I thought I'd be cooking with a partner. It's not fair. She's never here. I don't get twice the marks for doing all the work.
M	MRS. GREIR	I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
M	SETH	Look at Evan.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	While I'm over in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food because I can't even properly mix ingredients by myself, I gotta look over at that. CONTINUED: 15
M	SETH (CONT'D)	I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I'm like a single mother.
M	MRS. GREIR	Well, save it for next week. Today Jules' partner isn't here either. Pair up with her. Station four.
M	SETH	Jules?
F	JULES	Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again?
M	SETH	That's kind of a personal question.
F	JULES	What?
M	SETH	Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
F	JULES	Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd be forced to work with me. There's my attempt at humour.
M	SETH	Well, I would call that a success. Marscampone... scamponee cheese? Is that some kind of new cheese or something?
F	JULES	All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.
M	SETH	Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.
F	JULES	Thank you! Yes! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy. Like, they tell you it's moldy, then they tell you to eat it anyway.
M	SETH	Well whoever "they" are, they can eat my dick.
F	JULES	What are you doing tonight?
M	SETH	I don't know, probably nothing. Why?
F	JULES	My parents are out of town and I'm thinking of having a party. I don't know how big it'll be, but you should come anyways.
M	SETH	Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love parties.
F	JULES	Really? I don't usually see you at them.
M	SETH	Oh, uh. It's more of, like, a love-hate thing. Right now I love them, though. Uh...how do I do this?
F	JULES	I'll write down my address and number.
F	EVAN	That's good shit. Huh, Miroki?
M	SETH	Dude! She's havin' a fuckin' party.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	Don't tell Fogell about the party.
M	FOGELL	Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g- string and you could see it right through the pants.
M	FOGELL	It's nine thirty.
F	NICOLA	What?
M	FOGELL	I told her what time it was. It was awesome. She's got the nicest ass.
M	SETH	Like you'd know what to do with it.
M	FOGELL	Ha ha. I'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State.
M	SETH	Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college where the girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me.
M	FOGELL	What are you guys doing tonight? CONTINUED: 18
M	SETH	Nothing. Sorry. You'll just have to fingerbang yourself.
F	EVAN	What you doing?
M	FOGELL	Well, Seth always said I was too much of a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card.
M	SETH	Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan, didn't you just say that you heard about a party?
M	FOGELL	Why didn't you tell me?
M	SETH	Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze.
M	FOGELL	Sounds cool. Cool.
M	MRS. GREIR (O.S.)	If you're not in this class, leave this class!
F	EVAN	Well done, man. We'll see you after class.
M	SETH	Did you tell that nimrod you're not going to room with him?
F	EVAN	Uh...no, not yet.
M	SETH	You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang repellent.
F	JULES	Seth, dishes time. What's the hold up?
M	SETH	We're getting a fake ID.
F	JULES	Well, you two have four more years to cuddle, so let's get to work.
F	EVAN	Actually, we're going to different schools.
F	JULES	Really? You're cutting the cord? What's going to happen?
M	SETH	Nothing! Jesus.
F	EVAN	Yeah? What do people think is gonna happen? That's what I don't get.
M	SETH	We're not, like, dependent on each other.
F	EVAN	We met when we were 8, we were fine before then. It's not like we do everything together.
F	EVAN	So it looks like we get a little graduation party after all.
M	SETH	I would do terrible things to get with Jules tonight. Terrible things.
F	EVAN	No shit. I'd give my left foot to start dating Helen. She's killin' me.
M	SETH	Ah, Helen's a bitch.
F	EVAN	I'm fuckin' sick of this shit, man! Seriously. Why do you hate her? Is there even an actual reason? Because seriously, I'm beginning you think you like her.
M	SETH	Hell no! I hate her.
F	EVAN	Why?
M	SETH	I was never going to tell you this story, because I knew that if you heard it you would never want to get with Helen, but over the last few weeks I've been having a hard time thinking of a reason not to. So, here it is. Helen and I went to elementary school together, right? Well, in the third grade, I had...like...an odd problem. For some reason, I don't know why, I used to have this thing...where I would...like, kinda...sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks.
F	EVAN	What?
M	SETH (V.O.)	I'd just sit there for hours on end drawing dicks. I don't know what it was. I couldn't touch the pen to paper without it drawing a penis.
M	EVAN (V.O.)	That's fucked.
M	SETH (V.O.)	No shit that's fucked up. Here I am this little kid who can't stop drawing dicks to save his life.
F	EVAN	What does that have to do with Helen?
M	SETH	Just listen.
M	SETH (V.O.)	I was very secretive about this dick thing I had going, after all, even I thought I was a loon, lord knows what other people would have thought. So I would take all my dick drawings and stick them in this Muppet lunch-box I had.
M	SETH (V.O.)	So one day I was finishing up a picture of a real big and veiny bastard, when all of a sudden...
F	EVAN	You hit Helen's foot with your dick?
M	SETH	Well she fucking flipped. She started crying and shit. Ratted me out. CONTINUED: 26 The principle finds my cock-Muppet lunch- box, and he fucking flips.
M	SETH (V.O.)	It turns out the principle was some crazy religious guy and he thought I was possessed by some dick devil or something.
M	SETH	So, he calls my parents and they make me go to a psychologist who kept asking me all these dick questions. My parents wouldn't even let me eat dick-shaped foods for, like, months! No carrots, no Pop-sicles, no hot-dogs. You know how many fucking foods are shaped like dick?
F	EVAN	Wow. That's really messed up.
M	SETH	I can't even stand to look at her punk face. I'm going to go take a piss. Peace.
F	JULES	Seth. There you are. CONTINUED: 30
M	SETH	Hey. Here I am.
F	JULES	So you're coming to my party, right? It's fully on.
M	SETH	Yeah. Why? Should I not?
F	JULES	No, no, no. I really want you to come. But...uh, you did say you were getting a fake ID or something, is that right?
M	SETH	Very right. Right. I'm getting that.
F	SHIRLEY	Can you get us drinks?
M	SETH	Ummm... I don't know. I... think...maybe.
F	JULES	Come on, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.
M	SETH	Well, funny thing about my back. It's located on my cock. Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do you guys want?
F	JULES	Well, this is actually, like, a big favor, but, well, my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week, but the house if full of food, so I figure I should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party.
M	SETH	Wow. I would never even think of doing something that nice.
F	JULES	Well, this is really nice of you. I mean, I really appreciate this.
M	SETH	Should I just get, like, a shitload of different shit?
F	JULES	Whatever shit you think people would like, I don't really know.
F	SHIRLEY	I want Mike's Hard Lemonade.
F	JULES	Okay. I'll see you tonight.
M	SETH	Yeah! I'll see you!
M	GYM TEACHER	Evan, get into the game.
M	SETH	Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know Jules? You know what she just did? She came up to me and asked me if I would buy her alcohol. Not just her, her whole party. Do you know what that means? It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked, and she actually thought of me afterwards. Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of her party with. She wants me! She fucking wants my dick!
F	EVAN	Did you ever think maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol?
M	SETH	Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO THIS!
F	JULES	Yeah! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy.
M	SETH	She has an older brother! She could have asked him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me. She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the day that fucking has become possible.
F	EVAN	Are you stupid? You're not going to be able to sleep with her tonight.
M	SETH	She's going to be at the party, she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so I can get with her. Then, I make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck her all summer long! Then, by the time college rolls around, I'm the fuckin' fucking master, man!
F	EVAN	Make her your girlfriend? Of course! That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet?
M	SETH	Once I've gotten with her, I write her love letters, flowers, I'll do anything - I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the universe - what chick wouldn't go out with a guy like that? CONTINUED: 33
M	CLASSMATE	What the hell, Evan?
M	CLASSMATE (CONT'D)	Fuck you, man.
M	SETH	Fuck off, Greg. Why don't you piss your pants again?
M	CLASSMATE	That was, like, eight years ago, asshole!
M	SETH	Wanna hear the best part?
F	EVAN	Oh, I haven't?
M	SETH	Helen!
M	SETH (CONT'D)	You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are both drunk, get with her! This is the last party we're ever going to go to as high school people! I've fully ignored my hatred for Helen in coming up with this, which is a big ass deal. We need to stop being pussy and for once just goes balls out, man!
F	EVAN	I should get Helen alcohol?
M	SETH	Of course! It'll be pimp, and then you know she'll be drunk.
F	EVAN	Have you talked to Fogell?
M	SETH	You talk to Helen, I'll find that retard Fogell.
F	EVAN	Hey Helen! Hold up. Did you hear about the party tonight?
M	HELEN	Yeah, I just heard. It sounds sweet. You're not coming, are you?
F	EVAN	No, no, I am. That's why I came looking for you. Me and some guys are going to the liquor store after class, so I was thinking I could buy you yours, if you needed someone to.
M	HELEN	Yeah! That'd be great, that'd save me such a hassle, cause I was going to beg my sister, but yeah, could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I'll pay you back tonight.
F	EVAN	You will absolutely not. It's my treat.
M	HELEN	Wow. Thanks, Evan.
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Hey! You punched my tit!
F	EVAN	I'm sorry! Shit, shit. I'm so sorry! I just wanted to give you a friendly nudge in the arm, you know? I'm so sorry.
M	HELEN	Don't worry about it. So I'll see you at the party?
F	EVAN	Yeah. I'll see you then. I'm so sorry about that.
M	SETH	That douche bag isn't back yet, I've been standing here with my thumb up my ass.
F	EVAN	I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it. It was pimp.
M	SETH	Whoa. That is fucking pimp. Why didn't I do that? Shit.
M	SETH	That's what we get for trusting a mental midget! He's fucking it all up! I bet he pussied out, just like I said he would!
M	SETH	I mean, what are we going to tell the girls? "Sorry, we couldn't do what we promised because we're dickless incompetents!" We'll never get laid because of that little ass-fuck. How did he get in to State?! He's got shit for brains! Shit! How else can we get liquor?
M	FOGELL (O.S.)	Hey guys! CONTINUED: 37
F	EVAN	Where have you been?
M	SETH	Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack! You better fucking have it, where is it?
M	FOGELL	I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man, look.
F	EVAN	Okay Mr..."McLovin"? What kind of a stupid name is that? What are you trying to be, an Irish R&B; singer?
M	FOGELL	Well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there.
M	SETH	So you picked McLovin?
M	FOGELL	It was between that or Muhammad.
M	SETH	Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why didn't you just pick a common name?
M	FOGELL	Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth.
F	EVAN	Have you ever actually met a guy named Muhammad?
M	FOGELL	Have you actually ever met a guy named McLovin?
M	SETH	No! That's why you picked a bad name.
F	EVAN	You probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake ID!
M	SETH	Look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name. It just says "NAME: MCLOVIN"
F	EVAN	One name?
M	FOGELL	I just thought McLovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it.
F	EVAN	Under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your ID?
M	FOGELL	She could ask. Or, I could just show it to her.
M	SETH	Holy shit! I don't believe this. This says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you just put 21?
M	FOGELL	I knew you would ask that. Look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ID's trying to act like Joe Casual. Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old. Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are?
M	SETH	Fool!
F	EVAN	Calm down! It's not terrible! This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor". What's it gonna be?
M	FOGELL	I am McLovin.
M	SETH	You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and this is never going to work. We need a new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to Canada or something?
M	FOGELL	I still think it's going to work.
M	SETH	What the fuck? Where's my car?
F	EVAN	I told you, man! What did I say? I told you that was a dumb idea.
M	FOGELL	Why would you park in the staff-
M	SETH	Shut up, Fogell.
M	FOGELL	`Cause you're not staff.
M	SETH	I am aware of that, Fagell.
M	FOGELL	Will you still pick me up from work?
M	SETH	Let's go to your house. Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and steal your parents' booze like your brother always does. Take a bit from every bottle. Piece of cake. It's not exactly what Jules wanted, but it'll do, right?
F	EVAN	Come on! Just wear what you wore to school.
M	SETH	I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming.
F	EVAN	Why don't you just go to your house and get your own clothes? `Cause this is stupid.
M	SETH	You're stupid! I can't go home. Then my mom will know the car got towed and I'll be grounded tonight. I'll just stay here all weekend and pick it up on Monday.
F	EVAN	Where the fuck is the dirt bike? Ah, screw it. I'm just gonna kill everyone. Boom! Die, piggies!!!
M	SETH	Don't you have bigger clothes?
F	EVAN	See what my dad's got.
M	SETH	Not bad, eh?
F	EVAN	It's, like, 7:30 and my Mom's still here. Alright, here's what we'll do. I'll fuck your Mom in the basement while you steal the liquor.
F	EVAN	Fuck you, asshole. Let's just sneak down there and grab it.
M	SETH	Alright, dude. Get ready to receive.
F	EVAN	I can't believe it. They marked them.
M	SETH	What do you mean they...oh, man! Your parents are fuckers. What do we do now?
F	EVAN	Shh!!! We...we...take some and fill it back up with water. Get ready, I'll get water.
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Gin? That stuff is literally undrinkable.
M	SETH	It's the biggest bottle, you douche. Just do it! She's right in the other room! CONTINUED: 40
F	EVAN	Run!
M	SETH	But, the booze?
F	EVAN	Take it!
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Bye, Mom! Love you.
M	EVAN'S MOM	Love you, sweety.
M	SETH	Look at this mother. Smell it's glory.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	Mmm. It's good. Barely a scent.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	See that? I always said I had the highest alcohol tolerance. I'm like Superman.
F	EVAN	It's fucking water!
M	SETH	Water? Fuck. Your brother beat us to the punch. We have to go back!
F	EVAN	We can't go back! She totally knew, she'll bust us for sure, and we have to meet Fogell.
M	SETH	Well, fuck...fine. Text your brother he's a stupid piece of crap.
M	SETH	What the hell is that?
M	FOGELL	A vest.
M	SETH	You're gonna look like a Pinocchio.
F	EVAN	What? It's just a vest.
M	FOGELL	Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in vests?
M	SETH	You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit.
M	FOGELL	No way! I work there. They know I'm not twenty-five.
M	SETH	Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's out of the equation! CONTINUED: 42 And now I'm gonna have to take drastic measures. I'm gonna steal the booze.
M	FOGELL	What?! No! Hell no! You can't do that!
F	EVAN	Yeah, right!
M	SETH	That's right. And that way I give Jules back her money, like you did with Helen. That was good thinking, that's fucking pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he's got, like, really bad scoliosis!
F	EVAN	You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's not going to steal it.
M	FOGELL	Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll get the liquor later.
M	SETH	I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't step back down. Maybe you "State" boys don't understand that.
M	SETH	Hope piggy can run.
M	CASHIER	How old are you?
M	SETH	Twenty two.
M	CASHIER	You certainly are. That'll be eighty dollars.
M	SETH	Thank you kindly.
M	CASHIER	You're welcome, Seth.
M	SETH	Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse. Would you like me to help you to your car?
M	OLD LADY	That would be lovely, young man. Would you like me to buy you alcohol?
M	SETH	That would be lovely!
M	SETH	Enjoy your remaining years!
M	OLD LADY	I will. Enjoy fucking Jules! CONTINUED: 48
M	SECURITY GAURD (O.S.)	Don't do it kid.
M	SETH	I never had a choice.
M	OLD LADY	AAAHHHHH!!!
M	FOGELL	Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the TV from her basement and I've got, like, three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so like, we can have that in the room-
F	EVAN	Shh. Seth's coming.
M	FOGELL	You still didn't tell him we're rooming-
F	EVAN	No. Shut up.
M	FOGELL	So, where's all the stolen liquor? Fuck you! I was gonna do it, but security was tight as shit. I was gonna do it though, don't think I wasn't. Let's go to the liquor store and try your stupid ID.
M	FOGELL	Wait! I'm gonna put my vest back in my locker!
F	EVAN	Well, here we are. Fogell, are you ready?
M	SETH	Here's the list.
M	FOGELL	A list? Why?
M	SETH	We're getting girls their booze so they'll get with us. I put a lot of thought into that list. It's the perfect party bar, so don't mess it up and get Sambuca again.
M	FOGELL	Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger-
F	EVAN	Goldschlager. That's for Helen, so do not forget it.
M	FOGELL	-Alize, Captain Morgan Rum, Smirnoff Rasberry and a big ass bottle of Popov-
M	SETH	Oh yeah, and Mike's Hard Lemonade.
M	FOGELL	This is too much. I can't get away with this much!
F	EVAN	What's the difference?
M	FOGELL	I don't know, man. I'm getting, like, really nervous.
F	EVAN	Are you okay?
M	SETH	What the hell are you doing?
M	FOGELL	I don't know if I want to do this.
M	SETH	What are you talking about? You just promised you would. What is this shit?
M	FOGELL	What if they turn me down?
M	SETH	Then we're in the same place that we're in right now!
M	FOGELL	It's fucking humiliating! Everyone in the store sees them kicking me out. What if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf? I can't do that!
M	SETH	This whole thing is bigger than you, asshead! Just go in there and buy the damn alcohol!
M	FOGELL	What if I don't feel like it anymore?
M	SETH	Then I will kill you! How's that? If you don't buy the alcohol, I will kill you!
M	FOGELL	Killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID!
M	SETH	Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self.
M	FOGELL	You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that!
F	EVAN	Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! You said you'd do it, so do it. It's why you bought the ID, so just go do it.
M	FOGELL	I'll try.
M	CLERK	Hi there.
M	SON	Fogell?
M	FOGELL	No.
M	SON	Yo, Fogell. `Sup man. What're you doing here?
M	FOGELL	Uh...nothing. Not Fogell... Shut up, Moscovitch. You don't know me.
M	MOSCOVITCH	Oh, oh. Cool, cool. Good luck.
M	FOGELL	Fuck.
M	CLERK	Is there a problem, sir?
M	FOGELL	Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever.
M	CLERK	Sir, did you do this? On the floor?
M	FOGELL	No. I think it happened before.
M	CLERK	Are you sure?
M	FOGELL	I think I would know, thank you.
M	CASHIER	Um, yes, may I please see some ID?
M	OLD-LOOKING GUY	No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in years.
M	CASHIER	Anyone who looks under thirty-five.
M	SETH	It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never had a problem. It's fine. Right?
F	EVAN	Calm down. Did you remember a condom?
M	SETH	You brought a condom?
F	EVAN	Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well. I brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too.
M	SETH	You asshole! You laughed in my face when I said we'd be having sex tonight. CONTINUED: 54 It doesn't mean you shouldn't be prepared. You didn't even bring one?
M	SETH	No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan! I can't believe you did that without even consulting me about it!
F	EVAN	I don't really even understand what your plan is.
M	SETH	I'm gonna go down on her for, like, hours. She'll love that. She'll want to go out with that.
F	EVAN	Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in bringing just one little condom.
M	SETH	And one little bottle of spermicidal lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know you brought that! These girls are 18, not dried up old ladies. They're ready to go.
F	EVAN	Fine. I won't bring the lube.
M	FOGELL	Hello... Mindy.
M	FOGELL (CONT'D)	Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years. I heard they recently decided to start adding more hops.
M	CASHIER	Umm, okay sir, I'm gonna need to see some ID.
M	FOGELL	Identification?
F	EVAN	Do you think I could get Helen to do some kind of long distance thing?
M	SETH	Holy Shit! It's Cary Hutchins!
F	EVAN	I haven't seen her since she switched schools.
M	SETH	She had the biggest tits in the universe.
F	EVAN	I heard she had breast-reduction surgery. Her tits must be crazy perfect now.
M	SETH	I gotta see these bastards. Let's check `em out.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	Man, I'm gonna pretend to trip and grab `em. I hope they've healed.
M	CASHIER	That comes to a total of $123.59
M	FOGELL	What the hell happened?!
M	CASHIER	I don't believe it...I don't believe it....
F	EVAN	That was a waste.
M	SETH	But she fully looked way better before. I thought when they reduced them, they just kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them more supple.
F	EVAN	I can't even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller.
M	SETH	It's like me making my nuts saggier.
F	EVAN	Whoa. What's this?
M	SETH	What?
F	EVAN	Check it out! The cops!
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Shit! They busted Fogell!
M	OFFICER SLATER	So, did he punch anyone else?
M	CASHIER	I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand that? A goddamn exam!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Apparently, she has an exam.
M	OFFICER SLATER	So then, son, you're the one that got punched?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	We'd like to ask you a couple questions.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)	Okay, first things first. What's your name? CONTINUED: 59
M	FOGELL	My name, it's...it's.. Mc..mac..laddle...
M	OFFICER SLATER	MicMac what?
M	FOGELL	No, no I said, "McLovin".
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	McLovin?
M	FOGELL	McLovin.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Cool name. And your first name?
M	FOGELL	Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an interesting...uh...event...
M	SETH	I don't believe this bullshit! I can't...this isn't happening! I didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit! WE NEED THAT FUCKING LIQUOR!
F	EVAN	Oh my god. Are they gonna take him downtown?
M	SETH	Fuck Fogell! He got arrested! We're on our own. CONTINUED: 60 We need a new way of getting liquor. AAAHHH!! The money! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How much money can you get?
F	EVAN	What are you talking about? Money? What about Fogell?
M	SETH	That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money!
F	EVAN	We have to help him!
M	SETH	Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him out of jail? I don't even know where jail is! What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money!
F	EVAN	Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think. We need to think.
M	SETH	Fuck thinking! We need to act!
M	OFFICER SLATER	Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's no need to get irrational.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	A lot of people have strange names these days. CONTINUED: 61
M	OFFICER SLATER	I once arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Pearl Necklace."
M	FOGELL	It's just... I changed my name. I was going to be a singer. R&B.;
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Fine. That's not illegal.
M	OFFICER SLATER	And, how old are you McLovin?
M	FOGELL	Old enough.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Old enough for what?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Can I see your ID?
M	FOGELL	Um...okay...
M	OFFICER SLATER	You're an organ donor?
M	FOGELL	What?
M	OFFICER SLATER	I didn't want to be one but my wife insisted.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Just like a woman. Even after you're dead, they want to tear your heart out.
M	FOGELL	Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't really have any information. I didn't really see him. His fist hit here.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Are you in a hurry or something?
M	FOGELL	Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a bus.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Where were you going?
M	FOGELL	Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.
M	OFFICER SLATER	We'll take you there, get your information on the way. Sit tight.
M	DRIVER	I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry! I didn't see you at all. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm sorry, man. Look, what can I do? Are you okay?
M	DRIVER (CONT'D)	I mean, please don't report me, we can figure this out, okay?
M	SETH	Why wouldn't I report you?
M	DRIVER	Because I'll do anything! Please! Anything! What can I do?
M	SETH	You have any money?
F	EVAN	What are you doing?
M	DRIVER	Fine. Just take it.
M	SETH	What is this? This isn't enough.
M	DRIVER	It's all I have.
M	SETH	Well, you just came from the liquor store, give us your liquor.
M	DRIVER	I didn't get any. They're not letting anyone in. They're arresting someone or something.
M	SETH	Well, they'll be arresting somebody else if you don't do something quick. Ow! My shoulder! It's killing me.
M	DRIVER	No! Wait! Okay, you want alcohol? I can get you alcohol. I'm on my way to this party right now. There's gonna be tons of liquor. I will definitely get you plenty.
M	SETH	You better.
F	EVAN	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come here. What are you doing?
M	SETH	What? Jules' money is gone, Fogell's out, we've got no other option. Let's go.
F	EVAN	I don't....I don't like this idea at all. I'm just not feeling it. That guy's fucking creepy. Just look at him.
M	DRIVER	You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance? Cause you totally look like his brother.
M	SETH	He's an idiot. And he's our only hope. Come on, don't break your promise to Helen.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying, huh? And you're the one that got punched. Did you hear her say she has an exam tomorrow? Boo-fuckin'-hoo. Am I right?
M	FOGELL	Heh. Good one.
M	OFFICER MICHEALS	Could we have taken her in? Just to scare the shit out of her?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Hah. Probably could have found a way. But a good general rule is only take people in you want to ride with. And whiny bitches don't make that cut.
M	DRIVER	One of you bros could have sat up here with me.
M	SETH	Aaah! Holy shit...
M	SETH (CONT'D)	Jules! What's the haps?
M	DRIVER	Who is it?
F	JULES	Seth! Where are you?
M	SETH	Jules! I just got in a cab and I'm going to the liquor store as we speak.
F	JULES	Awesome. I can't wait for you to get here.
M	SETH	Really?
F	JULES	Yeah. It looks like it could actually be a great party. I think, like, tons of people might show up. I hope they don't trash my house.
M	SETH	Well, if they want to do that they're going to have to get through me.
F	JULES	So I guess I don't have to worry then. I'll see you soon.
M	SETH	She called, man! That's insane! She's practically begging for it. She said, "I can't wait for you to get here."
M	DRIVER	That sounds like she fully wants it. Where's she gonna get it from, huh, my man?
F	EVAN	Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're here?
M	DRIVER	Oh, definitely. I'm essentially best friends with this guy. A whole bunch of my buddies are coming. Come on!
F	EVAN	This is weird.
M	SETH	Whatever. Just act casual. And old. All we gotta do is find the booze and haul ass out of here.
M	SETH	Holy shit! Let's grab one of these buckets and go. What the fuck do you think you're doing?
M	DRIVER (O.S.)	What, man? It's nothing.
M	MARK	You calling more of your stupid friends again? Ya prick.
M	DRIVER	Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax.
M	MARK	Get the fuck out of my house.
M	DRIVER	Mark, come on. What the heck? Don't be a dick.
M	DRIVER	Mark! Dude! This is bullshit! Just chi-
M	DRIVER (CONT'D)	Ahhhh! Fuck! Fuck you, man. I'll fucking do this!
M	MARK	Francis, you and your idiot friends stay the away from me and mine or I'll flipping shiv your ass!
F	EVAN	Dude, let's slip out the back.
M	SETH	Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just hurry up and do this.
F	EVAN	You want to end up like that guy? Not me, I need my nuts.
M	SETH	We need this liquor! You need it! I don't need it. I'm going to tell Helen I like her, and then maybe she'll get with me; not after I get her stinking drunk. CONTINUED: 70
M	SETH	Then why haven't you ever made a move, you pussy?
F	EVAN	Because I respect her! I'm not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her.
M	SETH	These aren't girls, they're women! They need our dicks as much as we need their poons - and we all love liquor, so where's the fucking beef?!
F	EVAN	We're leaving, okay? These guys could kill us. You want to get killed for liquor?
M	SETH	You're really gonna bail on me?!
F	EVAN	Jesus...
M	SETH	Okay, okay...if that's how you're going to be, then I'll get the booze on my own. And you're not getting any. And neither is Helen!
M	FOGELL	Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer those, uh, questions now if you want.
M	OFFICER SLATER	We get the gist of it. You were buying some beer, some guys came in and robbed the place. I don't think we're gonna find `em this time.
M	FOGELL	It was only one guy.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could never catch one guy.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	You see, McLovin, if it was two guys, we'd have twice the chance of catching one of them. But just one guy? I mean, how are we supposed to find one guy in this whole city?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people there are in this city? I have trouble finding people I know.
M	FOGELL	Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or something? Don't you have a computer?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone walks up to me on the street, and is like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that?
M	FOGELL	Who's Bob?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then how am I supposed to know where he is?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	When you're new to the force, like I am-
M	OFFICER SLATER	Only six months in. I got two and a half years under my belt.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	You learn a lot of crazy stuff. For example-
M	RADIO	We have a 245 at East 24 and Montgomery. It's Bailey's Bar and Grill. Car 43, respond please.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Ten-four. Nice. Ya see, Michaels, when ever there's a call for a bar, you take it.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Good fucking call, sir.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Hey, McLovin. We got a situation at Bailey's. We have to see to that, but we'll drop you off right after. Okay?
M	FOGELL	Um...okay...
M	ENORMOUS GUY	Hey Mark, you want another beer?
F	EVAN	Whaa! What the...oh..
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Oh dude. Oh dude. Oh dude.
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Okay. Okay. Here we go...
M	HELEN (O.S.)	Eva...lo.................
F	EVAN	Helen? Helen?!?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Alright McLovin, this will only take a few minutes. Just grab a beer at the bar and we'll be done before you know it.
M	FOGELL	Well...what's goin' on in there? CONTINUED: 76 Everywhere?!? You didn't see me pissin' anywhere!!!
M	OFFICER SLATER	Alright, Michaels. I've got your back. Show this rummy how we roll.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Excuse me! Sir!
M	HOMELESS GUY	AAAHHHHH!!!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Resisting!
M	OFFICER SLATER	Good one, Michaels!
M	OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)	Fuck!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Should I shoot him?!?
M	OFFICER SLATER	NO!!!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Stop him, McLovin!!! AHHH!!!
M	FOGELL	Ow!!! Please! Stop, you fucking bum!!!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	McLovin! Nice!
M	OFFICER SLATER	I am buying you a beer, McLovin!
M	SETH	Hey, wut up?
M	GUY 1	What is that? Is that red wine? CONTINUED: 79
M	SETH	Uh...no. What? I don't know what you're talking about.
M	GUY 1	That shit you spilled all over yourself, idiot.
M	SETH	I didn't spill anything on myself.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	Oh shit.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	What the hell is this?
M	GUY 1	Oh my lord. You were just dancing in there, right?
M	SETH	Yeah, so?
M	GUY 1	It's fucking blood.
M	SETH	Why would I get blood on my leg from--- OH SHIT!
M	SETH (CONT'D)	Some girl perioded on my fucking leg!
M	GUY 2	I've never seen that before in my life.
M	SETH	That is disgusting.
M	GUY 1	I gotta show this to Bill.
M	SETH	Who's Bill? Don't show Bill! No! I can't believe this is happening!
M	GUY 2	We should find who did it.
M	SETH	This is un-fucking-believable. I have to look good tonight!
M	GUY 2	Who'd you dance with?
M	SETH	Who gives a shit? Fuck! These aren't even my pants!
M	SETH	Yeah. It's really funny, huh? Yuk it up, assholes.
M	PARTY DUDE	Dude! Check it out! That guy's having his period!
M	PARTY GIRL	He looks about the right age!
M	SETH	I gotta clean this shit. CONTINUED: 80
M	RADIO	Calling all units, armed and dangerous man in the vicinity of-
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	So anyways, we leave the bar, I'm charmin' her pants off telling her stories of shoot-outs and shit.
M	FOGELL	You've been in shoot-outs!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Nope.
M	OFFICER SLATER	McLovin, all we do is bonk homeless people on the head. You're practically a cop now.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	So I pull up in front of her house and she asks me to come inside for some coffee. Of course, I say yes.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Oh shit. CONTINUED: 83
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Oh shit. So we go into the kitchen. I start taking off my clothes, she fucking flips, starts screaming at me, and I'm like "Can't have coffee without cream." Oh!!! Right? I fucking said that. Then, she slaps me, throws me out. I'm telling you McLovin, stay out of bars.
M	FOGELL	Hey, you don't need to tell me.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	So, yeah, you gotta look in different places. The gym, an art class, you know, shit like that.
M	OFFICER SLATER	I met the Missus at paint ball. Can you believe that? I shot her in the neck, and we just hit it off. And my first wife -- who is a whore -- where do you think we met? A bar.
M	FOGELL	I don't know. I find they're always good for a little quick ass.
M	OFFICER SLATER	I bet I know your trick, McLovin. You do the whole mysterious guy thing, right?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Yeah McLovin, how's it going with the ladies?
M	FOGELL	Well, officers, it's not the going with the ladies I care about, it's the coming.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Oh! McLovin in the house!
M	FOGELL	So...you guys got guns, huh?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Yeah. We got guns.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	I haven't had one for long, but, man, let me tell you - it's like having two dicks.
M	FOGELL	Can I...can I hold one? Your gun?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	I mean, if we took the bullets out?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Yeah. Why not?
M	OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)	Here.
M	FOGELL	Wow. I've never held one. Are they hard to shoot?
M	OFFICER SLATER	If you're Michaels they are. He can't shoot worth dick.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Fuck you, old man. I could out-shoot you with my sack tucked between my legs.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Only one way to settle this.
M	FOGELL	You guys are going to shoot something, right?
M	SETH	Jesus's tits!
M	HELEN	Hello?
F	BECCA	Is it him?
M	HELEN	Shut up.
F	EVAN	Hey! Helen. Hi. I had bad reception. Are you at the party?
M	HELEN	No, I'm in a cab. I'll be there soon. Are you still coming?
F	EVAN	Yeah, definitely. Um, about your Goldschlager... CONTINUED: 86
M	HELEN	Shut up.
F	EVAN	What's going on there?
M	HELEN	Oh, nothing, I just wanted to make sure you were still coming, you know, and that you didn't get caught up at a cocktail party or some club.
F	EVAN	Nope. I'm gonna be there.
M	HELEN	Well, I can't wait to see you.
F	EVAN	I think it's going to be a real fun...event.
M	HELEN	Okay. Bye.
M	DUDE 1	They're going to kill that guy, man. That bitch's boyfriend is so pissed.
M	DUDE 2	Yeah. And he's a beast.
M	DUDE 3	Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid with the splotch on his crotch?
F	EVAN	No. What splotch- CONTINUED: 87
M	DUDE 2	I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was at that party with me.
M	DUDE 4	Who's he?
M	DUDE 2	He's Jimmy's brother. The dude with the crazy raps, the one I told you about!
F	EVAN	Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy, man. Sorry.
M	DUDE 3	No. No, that's you, man. You are fully Jimmy's brother! You were just so messed up you can't remember.
F	EVAN	Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't even listen to rap.
M	DUDE 3	It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I've been telling these guys about you. Just give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap.
M	SETH	I did it man. Peace out-tro. CONTINUED: 89 There! That's the guy!
M	SETH	Hey! You got one, too! We're blood brothers.
M	MARK	Shut it, you little shitter! What the hell were you doing dancing with Jacinda?
M	SETH	I...I didn't dance with her! I don't even dance! Never even tried it!
M	MARK	Then where did that come from, asshole?
M	SETH	I don't know. Maybe me and you rubbed up against each other at some point. How am I supposed to know?
F	EVAN	...cause, yo! Bitches and gats, bitches and gats, what do all of we's got?
M	DUDES	Bitches and gats!
F	EVAN	When we steal all the money?
M	DUDES	Bitches and gats! CONTINUED: 90
F	EVAN	Yo! I kill the whores of Vice City with my magnum 9/Take out the punk pigs with my Glok design/ Drink a fifth of Hennessy and get benign/Fuck all the bitches with their asses fine
M	THE DUDES	Oh!!!
M	SOME GUY	Dudes! Looks like a fight!
M	SETH	I swear to God it wasn't me!
M	MARK	And what the fuck is this?
M	SETH	It's nothing. It's detergent.
M	MARK	Yeah. And what are you doing with it?
M	SETH	I...uh, I got blood on my pants.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	I brought them from home. CONTINUED: 91 AAAHHHHHHH!!! FUCK!!!
M	DUDE 3	Hold him!
F	EVAN	What?
M	DUDE 2	HOLD HIM!!!
M	JACINDA	You motherfucker!
M	SETH	AHH!!!
M	JACINDA	You ruined my birthday!!! You humiliated me!!!
M	SETH	You're the one who used my leg as a tampon!
M	JACINDA	Yeah, Fifth and Paysview, please hurry!
M	OFFICER SLATER	You've been saying some bold words, my friend. Better not mess up.
M	FOGELL	You can do it, officer.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Boo-yaka-sha!!! Suck it, Slater. Suck my nuts. Long, but gentle.
M	FOGELL	Yeah! And eat his ass! Can I shoot one?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Yeah. Sure. Here. Go nuts.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Fuck. The cops!
M	OFFICER SLATER	Let's bail! Shotgun!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Hah, hah! Eat it. So, dudes, what do we do now?
M	RADIO	We got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview, all units in the area report to Fifth and Paysview. Car 98. That's you. Do it. Seriously.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Son-of-a-bitch. Car 98, ten-four. Ya dumb whore. Ha!
M	FOGELL	What does that mean? We gonna get to shoot anyone?
M	OFFICER SLATER	I wish. Probably some lame house party. We'll drop you off after. Cool?
M	FOGELL	Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how we roll.
M	SETH	...huff...hufff...you fuckin' prick...
F	EVAN	What?
M	SETH	You...huff...bailed on me...huff...man.
F	EVAN	No I didn't!
M	SETH	Of course you did! We were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it! That's the definition of bailing!
F	EVAN	If you said we should burn our dicks off and I didn't, that's not bailing!
M	SETH	It is bailing, if you promised to burn your dick off!
F	EVAN	What?!
M	SETH	The bottom line is you're a bailer. You just bailed on me, you bailed on me this morning when Terry spat on me, and you're bailing on me next year!
F	EVAN	Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes out!
M	SETH	We were supposed to go to college together! Since elementary school! What ever happened to that!
F	EVAN	What happened to that, is that you're too stupid to get into the schools I did!
M	SETH	I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!
F	EVAN	You've wasted all my time, you selfish bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and making friends, I threw away the last three years talking bullshit with you! And now, because of you, I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin!
M	SETH	Getting with a girl won't make you any less of a loser next year!
F	EVAN	You talking to me or yourself? You fucking loser!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	How do they expect us to work these things while we're driving? I can't even work my iMac while I'm sitting at my desk.
M	FOGELL	So, like, what does that computer do?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Pretty much anything, if you're smart enough to figure it out. Like, who do you really hate? Gimme a name.
M	FOGELL	Um...my French teacher. Mrs. Graham. Susette Graham.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Can I do it?
M	FOGELL	What did you do?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Tomorrow, Mrs. Graham will have a boot on her car.
M	FOGELL	I hate my dad, too! CONTINUED: 96
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Okay. The place should be around here somewhere. McLovin, are the numbers on that side odd or even?
M	FOGELL	It's too dark out.
M	OFFICER SLATER	We got flashlights.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	I wasn't even sure light came out of those things. I thought they were just cool looking clubs.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	My eyes! CONTINUED: 100
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Oh shit. Shit, shit, SHIT!
M	OFFICER SLATER	I don't believe this is happening again.
M	FOGELL	Oh my god...is he...are you gonna make sure he's alright?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Okay, okay, we're gonna get out of the car now. McLovin, you stay right there.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	That guy better not be dead.
F	EVAN	I'm sorry! You pushed me first.
M	SETH	I didn't push you into fucking oncoming traffic!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Is everyone alright?
M	SETH	We're great.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Well, you should be careful boys. That's how accidents happen.
M	SETH	What, when cops drive like maniacs and hop the fucking curb?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Pardon?
F	EVAN	Nothing. CONTINUED: 101
M	OFFICER SLATER	Pabst. You boys been doing a bit of drinking?
F	EVAN	No officer. Not at all.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Is that more beer you got over there?
M	SETH	Umm, no sir, detergent.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Detergent?
M	SETH	My clothes are dirty.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	You boys stay right here.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Alright, Michaels. The car is completely fucked, and you're the one who fucked it up, so you've got to fix it.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	What do I do?
M	OFFICER SLATER	We arrest these little crap stains and dump it on them, I'll take care of that. You go make sure McLovin is good to play ball. This is it, Michaels. CONTINUED: 103 You wanna hang with the big boys, you gotta get your hands dirty. You cool?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Yeah, I'm cool.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Get on the ground. Now! Spread your shit!
F	EVAN	Puh...please don't shoot.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Puh- Puh- Please shut the fuck up!
M	FOGELL	Was the guy alright?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	What? Oh, yeah, the guy was fine.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)	Are you awake, sir?
M	OFFICER MICHEALS	I'm sorry, McLovin. But I really need this to be a private thing. Listen McLovin, you... like... Officer Slater and myself, don't you?
M	FOGELL	Umm, yeah, sure. You guys are great.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Yeah, well, we're also on probation. You see, we've actually trashed two other cars. The first time wasn't our fault, and the second time a bee flew in and I freaked out. Point is, we trash another car, without a good reason, we're fucked. Know what I'm saying?
M	FOGELL	Sure.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Now, we're going to arrest these guys, and if you don't mind, which you shouldn't, we'd like you to write a fake witness report saying they jumped out in front of our car. Cool, McLovin?
M	OFFICER SLATER	How tall are you?
F	EVAN	Uh...I don't know, five-foot-ten, eleven?
M	OFFICER SLATER	And you said those were "Pumas?" CONTINUED: 105
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Shit!
M	FOGELL	Seth! Wait up!
M	OFFICER SLATER	Shit! Shit! McLovin bailed!
M	OFFICER SLATER	Fuck! CONTINUED: 109
M	KIDS	Help/ It's a monster!/ Daddy! AAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
M	KID	AHHH!!! NO!!! DADDY!!!!
M	FOGELL	Holy shit! Little kids!!!
M	SETH	Ow!
M	FATHER(O.S.)	Get away from my children!
M	FATHER(CONT'D)	You sick sons-of-bitches!
M	FOGELL	Help! Aaaahhh!!!!
M	SETH	ARGGG!
M	OFFICER SLATER	Stupid little bastards.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Maybe I should fire a shot? Scare `em out?
F	EVAN	Oh god. Oh god. Fuck. Fuck.
M	FOGELL SETH	Ahh! Jesus!
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Should I run!?!
M	SETH	Fucking run!
M	HOMELESS GUY (O.S.)	Hey! It's you!
M	HOMELESS GUY (CONT'D)	You got booze in the bag? Can you gimme some?
M	SETH	No! Fuck off! You already drank our detergent beer!
M	HOMELESS GUY	That was beer?! Well, you little shit...ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze...gimme it...
M	SETH	Back off, or we'll kick the shit out of you!
F	EVAN	We can't do that. He's homeless. CONTINUED: 114
M	SETH	So? Who cares? Just because he doesn't have a home doesn't mean he can be a lunatic!
M	HOMELESS GUY	Give me the booze!
F	EVAN	GOOOOOOOLDSCHLLLAAAAAAAGERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
M	HOMELESS GUY	Shit!!! Gold!!!
M	FOGELL	What the hell is going on? Where did you come from?
M	BUS DRIVER	Get the fuck off the bus or I'm calling the cops!!!
M	FOGELL	Holy shit! We're like three blocks away! Best luck ever!
M	FOGELL	Fuck yeah, guys. We made it. Together and safe.
F	EVAN	I can't believe Helen's bottle broke.
M	FOGELL	I'm sure it'll be fine.
M	SETH	What's the difference? I thought you didn't need it anyways. I thought you were just going to tell her how you feel, you fucking pussy.
F	EVAN	Yeah? Well, good luck getting Jule's drunk enough to have sex with you.
M	FOGELL	What's wrong with you guys?
M	SETH	Shut up, Fogell. Never mind. Evan'll tell you next year.
M	FOGELL	You told him? CONTINUED: 117
M	SETH	Told me what?
M	FOGELL	Well we have to tell him now.
F	EVAN	Fuck, Fogell! You're a god damn idiot.
M	FOGELL	Well, he knows something's up.
M	SETH	Just say it!
F	EVAN	Shit. Seth, me and Fogell are rooming together next year.
M	FOGELL	I don't even get what the big deal is, to be honest.
F	EVAN	I didn't tell you because-
M	SETH	Save that shit for later. We've got shit to do.
M	FOGELL	We never should have had to hide our arrangement.
F	JULES	Seth! Everyone, he's here! He's got it!
M	RANDOM GUY	He's got a shit load of booze!!!
M	SETH	The bar is open!
M	EVERYONE	Yeah Seth!/Clutch!/Nice!/I can't believe it!/Seth did that?!/ Who the fuck is Seth?
F	JULES	This is awesome. Thank you so much.
M	SETH	Sorry it was late.
F	JULES	Yeah. To be honest, people were starting to get seriously pissed off. Listen, I've got to go tell everyone the drinks are here. Don't go anywhere. Promise?
M	SETH	I'll be right here.
M	SETH	To Jules!
M	RANDOM GUY	Another one, but to you, man! Everyone, to this guy! Who the fuck are you, man?
M	SETH	Seth! CONTINUED: 119
M	RANDOM GUY	To Seth!
M	EVERYONE	To Seth!
M	SETH	Hey! Let's do another one to me!
F	EVAN	Becca! Hey.
F	BECCA	Where have you been, you almost blew it.
F	EVAN	What?
F	BECCA	Helen. She's been waiting for you. She's right over there. She's been yammering about you all night.
F	EVAN	What? What did she say? Does she think I'm a good guy? What did she say?
F	BECCA	It was something like, "I'll fully blow him tonight."
F	EVAN	What?!? Oh man. This is too much. Oh god. What do I do? I lost the Goldschlager I was supposed to bring her!
F	BECCA	Well, Jordana stole a bottle of tequila from her parents and her and Helen have been going at it. I think she'll be fine in that department. I'd just go over there and invite her upstairs, pronto.
F	EVAN	What? Oh man... But...she's totally hammered. If I get with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that, like, date rape?
F	BECCA	It's not date rape if you're drunk, too.
F	EVAN	I guess.
F	EVAN	Calm down, Evan. She likes you. She wants to suck on your penis. That's a good thing.
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Down the hatch. CONTINUED: 122
M	FOGELL	They call you Nicola, right?
F	NICOLA	And they call you Fogell.
M	FOGELL	Some do.
M	HELEN	Evan!!! Hey! Come here!!!
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Help me up! None of these people will help me up!
F	EVAN	Hey, Helen. Sorry I was-
M	HELEN	Evan! Oh my god! You are so fucking hilarious! Do you goes know how fucking hilarious Evan is? Tell them how hilarious you are! CONTINUED: 129
F	EVAN	Uh...well...uh...
M	HELEN	Listen to him!
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	See?!! He is so cute!
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	I've been waiting for you for, like, ever. What took you so long? Do you have my Goldschlager?
F	EVAN	Oh man, it's a crazy story-
M	HELEN	Here! Don't worry, we can drink this.
F	EVAN	I'm already pretty wasted. But...uh...here's to you.
M	HELEN	Light-weight! Hey...me and you should go upstairs now. I really want to...tell you something.
F	EVAN	Uh...uh...uh...you could just tell me right here-
M	HELEN	No! Let's go upstairs, come on! CONTINUED: (2) 129
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Careful...
F	NICOLA	McLovin! That's the funniest thing I've ever seen!
M	FOGELL	Yeah, I just thought it sounded old.
F	JULES	Hey, I'm back. I had to thank the peeps for comin' out.
M	SETH	Jules! The hostess with the most-est! The woman of the hour!
M	SETH (CONT'D)	This party's blowin' my ass off! I want you to have a drink with me.
F	JULES	No, thanks. I'm good. But, seriously, thanks for getting all the drinks. It really made the night.
M	SETH	It's just how I roll, Jules. No problems, no problems. CONTINUED: 131 Uh...you know...I love talking, and conversing with you, you're so good at it, but I can't hear you. Could we just go on the...uh...balcony or something?
F	JULES	Why not? I haven't conversed in ages. Let's do it.
F	EVAN	Are you okay?
M	HELEN	I so flirt with you in Math.
F	EVAN	Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long time-
M	HELEN	I know. I've wanted to get with you so hard. Like...so hard. Good... CONTINUED: 132
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	What the fuck...stupid shoe...
F	EVAN	Shit. Can you, like, slip out?
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Whoa. Fuckin'...careful.
M	HELEN	You...take off your pants... Or I'll cut `em off.
F	NICOLA	I can't believe I'm about to get with "Fogell".
M	FOGELL	Why?
F	NICOLA	I don't know. You're like, the most mysterious guy in the grade. Like, nobody knows anything about you.
M	FOGELL	Well, you're about to learn a few things.
F	JULES	Whoa! Whoa! Slow down.
M	SETH	What? What's wrong?
F	JULES	I'd...uh...prefer if we did this at some other time.
M	SETH	But...there is no other time. School's up! This is the only time...what's wrong with now?
F	JULES	Well, you're drunk. Like, really, really drunk.
M	SETH	So? So are you.
F	JULES	I'm not drunk at all. I don't even drink.
M	SETH	You don't drink? But...but, you told me to get the liquor!
F	JULES	Yeah, I'm...uh...throwin' a party, remember?
M	SETH	You don't drink!?!
F	JULES	No. I don't drink. CONTINUED: 134 And you, don't want to...uh, you know...
F	JULES	Uh, no. Not right now, thank you very much.
M	SETH	Ahhh....man...fuck....
F	JULES	Are you crying?
M	SETH	No! Yeah, so what if I am? I'm a fucking idiot and it was my last chance! So I should be crying.
F	JULES	Last chance to do what?
M	SETH	To make you my girlfriend for the summer, okay? There! You're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me, and I thought we'd both be drunk, but...
F	JULES	What would me be drunk have anything to do with it?
M	SETH	`Cause you'd never get with me in your right mind! Look at me! And now look at you!
M	RANDOM GIRL	Hey, Ricky! Was it a quarter, or an eighth you want?
M	RICKY (O.S.)	A fat eighth!
M	RANDOM GIRL	Whoa. Sorry.
M	HELEN	I wore this for you. Here we go...
M	HELEN (CONT'D)	Evan, I'm so wet.
F	EVAN	You're so beautiful.
M	HELEN	You've got such a smooth cock.
F	EVAN	Um...thank you. I've thought you were a really incredible person for a really long time.
M	HELEN	You've got to get hard for me...real hard.
F	EVAN	I'm...I'm..I'm about to. But first I just want to tell you exactly how I-
M	HELEN	I'm gonna suck your dick so good.
F	EVAN	You don't have to do that, you know, we can start this relationship on something more than just that.
M	HELEN	Yeah, Evan. I know. I need you to eat my hairy love crack.
F	EVAN	Jesus Christ.
M	HELEN	What's wrong?
F	EVAN	You don't want to do this.
M	HELEN	Yeah I do, I want to fuck you.
F	EVAN	Look, you know I really like you, Helen, but this is...it's just too intense. And I'm so drunk I don't even know how to, like, process-
M	HELEN	You're just being a pussy.
F	EVAN	What? Did you just call me a...pussy?
M	HELEN	Yeah...a scared little pussy-
F	EVAN	Oh god! Oh...
M	HELEN	I need Becca...Becca...
F	EVAN	I'll...uh...I'll go get her. Are you going to be okay?
M	HELEN	Oh God, oh God, oh...I'm puking...
M	FOGELL	I've got a boner.
F	NICOLA	Good. Do you have a condom?
M	FOGELL	And lube.
F	JULES	Seth, you...uh...
M	JULES (CONT'D)	You didn't blow it, you're a- AAAHHH!
M	JULES (CONT'D)	Seth! What the fuck!
M	SETH	...help me... CONTINUED: 137
M	SETH (CONT'D)	...sorry...
M	SETH (CONT'D)	Oh no. ...Evan...
F	EVAN	Life's bullshit, huh, Miroki?
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Fuckin' wax off, asshole!
M	SETH	No...I'm helping you, man! Just listen...
F	EVAN	Fuck off, jerk! You're hurting my shoulders!
M	TERRY	Hey! Look, it's Christina and Britney. Have fun boning each other on grad night! CONTINUED: 138
M	OFFICER SLATER	We had a complaint about the noise. It looks like you're having a nice little party here.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	A nice little underage drinking party.
F	EVAN	Dude! Seth! It's the cops! The cops.
M	SETH	That's what I've been...! Here...
M	OFFICER SLATER	Okay, everyone out. Party's over. Get out of here.
M	OFFICER SLATER(CONT'D)	I'll go upstairs. I told you this would release some anger.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	I'll tell you what would release some anger, if one of these little fuckers touched me and I got to club his face in.
F	NICOLA	Oh...uh...oh... It's...it's in. It's in. What the hell?
M	OFFICER SLATER	McLovin? What the fuck?
M	FOGELL	Officer Slater?
M	OFFICER SLATER	You ran away from us! Michaels! Get up here!
M	FOGELL	No! I hit my head when we crashed. I was all disoriented and I just wandered off, confused. Seriously!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Shut the fuck up! Wait a minute. How old was that girl? 16, 17? You sick bastard, that's statutory rape, McLovin.
M	OFFICER SLATER	McLovin!
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	He was violating a sixteen year-old girl!
M	FOGELL	What? No! No! I didn't break the law! I'm not really even-
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Sit your ass down and keep it down.
M	OFFICER SLATER	You're going to jail, fucko.
M	OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)	They don't take kindly to your type in jail, McLovin.
F	EVAN	Dude. You saved me!
M	SETH	I totally did! I wanted to!
F	EVAN	Wanna sleep at my house, man? You're my best friend!
M	SETH	Yeah! Sleepover! Fuckin...you got pizza bagels still?
F	EVAN	Yeah!!!! Look what else I gots!
M	SETH	Nice! Stupid pigs.
M	OFFICER SLATER	There you go.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	That does feel better.
M	FOGELL	So...am I going to jail?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Yeah!! You're going to fuckin' Azkaban!!!
M	FOGELL	What?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	You are the funniest fuckin' kid I have ever met!
M	OFFICER SLATER	We've been fuckin' with you! Jesus! I love this kid!
M	FOGELL	I don't understand!
M	OFFICER SLATER	We know you're not twenty five! What are we, morons? My god! What are you? Sixteen?
M	FOGELL	Seventeen. CONTINUED: 143
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Seventeen! Ha! We had you going, McLovin!
F	EVAN	Is the bang bus anything like this?
M	OFFICER SLATER	Alright, boys. What I'm about to show you is pretty much the greatest move in donut- spinning history. Behold: the reverse figure-eight.
M	FOGELL	So, like, what's your official position?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	If you were in, you were in. You are no longer a virgin, end of story. Screw cumming.
M	OFFICER SLATER	Alright. I think that's all the fun we're gettin' out of this one. CONTINUED: 146
M	OFFICER SLATER	...and by signing this you are officially saying that as we stopped you from being mugged, a crack-head stole our cruiser and did God knows what with it.
M	FOGELL	Of course. That mugger had nothing but murder in his eyes. I owe you my life.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	Can we do this already?
M	OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)	Can we shoot at it?
M	OFFICER SLATER	I don't know, can you?
M	OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)	I'm throwin' down the gauntlet. 50 bucks. Whoever hits the gas tank.
M	OFFICER MICHAELS	You are so fucking on.
M	FOGELL	Can I get a shot?
M	SETH	I can't believe she said that shit.
F	EVAN	Oh my lord. You have no idea! CONTINUED: 147 And then you saved me, man! I fucking love you!
M	SETH	I fucking love you, too, man! I'm not embarrassed, I just love you!
F	EVAN	Why don't we say that more? It feels good! I love you more than my brother, man. Like, when you went away for Easter last year, I, like, missed you. You know?
M	SETH	I missed you, too. Come here, man.
M	SETH (CONT'D)	We'll always be friends. `Cause we love each other. Like, three weeks ago I was in you room and, like, you were taking a dump and...I saw your residence placement thingy. I totally saw you're living with Fogell. So, like-
F	EVAN	I'm sorry, man.
M	SETH	Don't be! Don't be! I'm sorry. I was being a bitch.
F	EVAN	I need you to know that it's not like I even want to live with Fogell; it's just that I'm really afraid of living with strangers.
M	SETH	You know...I was pissed off I didn't get with Jules, but, like...we really got through a lot of our shit, you know? Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we kind of came together, again.
M	EVAN (CONT'D)	Good night, Seth. I love you.
M	SETH	Night, Evan. Love you, man.
F	EVAN	Oh...uh...hey. Morning.
M	SETH	Uh...morning.
F	EVAN	You sleep good?
M	SETH	Yeah. This is a really good pillow.
F	EVAN	Um...
M	SETH	Maybe I should get going.
F	EVAN	You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing anything. CONTINUED: 148 Oh...do you want to hang out? I was...gonna go to the mall, actually.
F	EVAN	Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a comforter. For college.
M	SETH	Yeah. That'd be nice. I'd really like that.
F	EVAN	Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your pants look good.
M	SETH	Well, I need someone's opinion.
F	EVAN	Fine. They're way too small.
M	SETH	Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's pants last night I realized that if I buy pants that are too small it'll encourage me to lose weight. And in tight pants chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.
F	EVAN	Yeah, the male camel toe look is really big this year.
M	SETH	These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck out of here.
M	HELEN	Again, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I actually did that.
F	JULES	I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a new one.
M	HELEN	I have to. It's puke.
F	EVAN	Holy shit!
M	SETH	Is that them?
F	EVAN	Should we hide?
M	SETH	Fuck that, man. I can't talk to her, look what I did to her!
F	EVAN	Helen called me a pussy to my face! What am I going to say to her?
M	HELEN JULES	Hi Evan, Seth. Hey guys.
M	EVAN SETH	Hi Helen, Hi Jules. Jules. Helen. Hi.
M	SETH	Oh my god. I'm so sorry, Jules.
F	JULES	It's okay.
F	EVAN	How are you feeling?
M	HELEN	Not bad, but not great, how about you?
M	SETH	That looks terrible. No! I mean, it doesn't look terrible, it looks-
F	JULES	Don't worry about it, Seth. It was an accident.
F	EVAN	Did you have fun last night?
F	JULES	Do you remember much?
M	HELEN	I really don't remember much.
M	SETH	Not really. I remember looking up, and you screaming at me. That's about it.
M	HELEN	I didn't puke on you, did I?
F	EVAN	No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me.
M	SETH	But seriously, I acted like a fuckin' idiot last night. I'm really sorry, you didn't deserve that.
M	HELEN	Yeah, I...um...I'm sorry, about all that. Thanks for being such a gentleman.
M	SETH	You look good with a black eye.
F	JULES	Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of cover-up for the grad photo.
M	SETH	Oh man...
M	HELEN	Yeah, and I'm going to Linen Brothers to buy Jules a new comforter.
F	EVAN	Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for college.
F	JULES	So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and buy me my cover-up, or what?
M	SETH	Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such bad acne last year, I became an expert on the stuff.
F	EVAN	You could get your college pants there.
M	SETH	Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Evan drove me here, how do we-
F	JULES	I've got my dad's car. I'll take you home, and Evan can give Helen a lift.
M	HELEN	That sounds good.
F	EVAN	Maybe we can go eat after?
M	HELEN	Sweet.
M	SETH	So, uh, I'll call you later.
F	EVAN	Yeah man, have a good one.
F	JULES	Come on, Seth. Let's go.
