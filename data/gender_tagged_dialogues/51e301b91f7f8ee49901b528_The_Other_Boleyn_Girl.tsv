M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SIR THOMAS	I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne. From the Carey family. ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired. Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	But that's wonderful.
M	SIR THOMAS	I turned it down.
M	SIR THOMAS	And offered them Mary instead. MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired. Pretty. Sweet-natured.
M	SIR THOMAS	Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do (better than a merchant's son.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	You underestimate Mary.
M	SIR THOMAS	Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer.
M	SIR THOMAS	But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart.
M	SIR THOMAS	Bravo! Anne! Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church. MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her
F	ANNE	May we come in..?
F	ANNE	Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful than me. Married before me. I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn Girl.'
F	MARY	Hardly.
M	GEORGE	No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity?
F	MARY	No, George. Never. I'll be married, that's all.. Apart from that - it won't change a thing. A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air
M	PRIEST	Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobis.. The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom,
M	WILLIAM	Are you happy?
F	MARY	Very.
M	WILLIAM	You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title?
F	MARY	No. I want a husband who loves me. And who thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night.
M	WILLIAM	Then you've found the right man.
F	ANNE	Who is that? He was staring at me in church?
M	GEORGE	That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in England.
M	GEORGE	But don't get your hopes up. He is already betrothed.
F	ANNE	Betrothed is not married, brother George. A lot can happen before you reach the altar. he DUKE OF NORFOLK, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and
M	SIR THOMAS	Thomas..
M	NORFOLK	I think I have managed to persuade the King to come and stay with you on progress. A week-end's hunting in late summer.
M	SIR THOMAS	But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much.. Did you hear that, Elizabeth?
M	LADY ELIZABETH	Yes.
M	SIR THOMAS	Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court.
M	NORFOLK	These are difficult times. I have it on good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved. It cannot be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage.
M	SIR THOMAS	What? And make a bastard King of England?
M	NORFOLK	A legitimized bastard. What choice does he have? Obviously, I've given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same?
M	SIR THOMAS	What about Anne?
M	SIR THOMAS	I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not officially a `Howard', but as your sister's daughter..
M	NORFOLK	But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary?
M	SIR THOMAS	If Anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say `yes'. But she's not.
M	SIR THOMAS	She's anything but. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the
M	ADY ELIZABETH	don't like it. It would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit. Money we don't have. LA king doesn't like her? Or if she sleeps with him but gives him a girl?
M	SIR THOMAS	And what if you were to look on the bright side? Just once?
M	SIR THOMAS	Risk nothing, you gain nothing.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue?
M	SIR THOMAS	Easy for you to say. You've had power and wealth all your life.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	Until I married you, Thomas. And I was happy to give it up. ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits.
F	ANNE	You asked to see me father?
M	SIR THOMAS	Yes. Come in. MARY is in a bathroom. Being prepared by ANNE for her wedding
F	MARY	o - the King himself is coming to Hever. I'm so happy for George.
F	ANNE	Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems he has ambitions for me, too. unpleasing appearance...
F	MARY	What? What are you saying..?
F	ANNE	It's known the King has a wandering eye. Imagine...if he were to like me?
F	MARY	But...you could never be more than his mistress. And that's no substitute for a husband.
F	ANNE	But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to? Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least.
F	MARY	But what about your happiness? Your future?
F	ANNE	I could be a happy Duchess. MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares
F	ANNE	Are you nervous?
F	MARY	A little.
F	ANNE	You'll tell me everything in the morning?
F	MARY	I promise.
F	ANNE	No details spared?
F	MARY	Hold me a moment?
M	MARY (cont'd)	I'm so lucky to have a man who is content with what he has.
M	MARY (cont'd)	You are, aren't you?
M	WILLIAM	I am the luckiest man in the world. Drink? You should. It will hurt less. Lie back.
M	WILLIAM (cont'd)	Thank you. The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust. The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside,
F	ANNE	There he is!
F	ANNE	You think he will like me?
F	MARY	Of course, sister. How could he not? The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the
M	SIR THOMAS	Your Majesty, you are most welcome.
M	HENRY	Lady Elizabeth..
M	SIR THOMAS	May I present my son, George.
M	HENRY	Your Uncle tells me I should have you at court. Should I?
M	GEORGE	It would be a great honour, Sir.
M	SIR THOMAS	And our daughter, Anne.
M	ENRY	No one said anything of a daughter.
M	HENRY	Had we known, we might have come sooner.
F	ANNE	Your Majesty..
M	SIR THOMAS	Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you around our modest house?
M	HENRY	A pleasure. ANNE leads the KING through the house. She is followed at a
F	ANNE	Here is the library.
M	HENRY	Charming.
F	ANNE	And through here, the observatory..
M	HENRY	Lovely..
M	HENRY	What's that?
F	ANNE	falcon, your Grace.
M	HENRY	I can see that. But what's it doing there? More to the point.. ..not just there, but in every corner in the house?
F	ANNE	I have no idea. Ask my father. Perhaps because falcons are vaguely associative with field sports - field sports with aristocracy - and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms.. ...a man with ambition will do the strangest things.
M	ENRY	That's a sharp tongue you have. I wonder what it might say about me behind my back?
F	ANNE	Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from me. Unless he fears an excess of compliments.
M	HENRY	Really? And what would they be..? The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled, frantically changing ANNE
M	SIR THOMAS	Bravo, Anne! The King was quite smitten! Told me so himself. And has requested you sit beside him at dinner.
M	SIR THOMAS	My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I knew you would up to the task. MUSIC is being played. Everyone is dressed in their finest, a
M	HENRY	Well played! And, may I say.. ..an excellent choice of music too!
M	HENRY	Sir Thomas, Lady Elizabeth, dear Anne. Your health. H ENRY raises his glass. Cheers and applause from the COURTIERS.
M	HENRY	..I had it from the lips of the Spanish ambassador himself. That our musicians are the envy of all Europe.
M	BRANDON	..then he was flattering you, your Grace.
M	HENRY	Our Universities and philosophers, too.
M	BRANDON	...another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans.
M	HENRY	What of our painters, then?
M	RANDON	Years behind their Italian counterparts. The truth is far from leading the world, we're a provincial outpost, lagging far behind.
M	HENRY	What? Is no one proud to be English? Anne? What say you?
F	ANNE	I know little of such matters, but I've not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a generation.
M	ENRY	Well said.
F	ANNE	Or our navy? The finest in the world. It's true.
F	ANNE	The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More?
M	HENRY	Never!
F	ANNE	I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more prosperous..
M	HENRY	She's right, by God! She's right! SIR THOMAS stops ANNE on her way upstairs.
M	SIR THOMAS	You did well tonight. Very well. Quite enough to be invited to court, I am sure of it.
M	SIR THOMAS	Now go to bed. Get a good night's sleep. Because there's still the hunt tomorrow. You must excel at that. MARY and ANNE lie together. In spoons position. ANNE is fast
M	F	inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns..
M	HENRY	Good morning, Anne.
F	ANNE	Good morning, your Grace.
M	HENRY	ho will you be riding with?
F	ANNE	On my own your Grace.
M	HENRY	Your own..?
F	ANNE	They have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own.
M	HENRY	ut with no man to hold onto? How will you stay on the horse?
F	ANNE	Why? The same way you hold onto yours, your Grace.
M	HENRY	We'll see.
M	HENRY	Let's away! The thunder of hooves..
M	HENRY	Hah! Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head.. The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost
M	HENRY	Hah..! The terrified DEER bolts into safety of the forest. The barking
M	IDER	We've lost him. He's in the forest.
M	HENRY	Then we must follow. H HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks
F	ANNE	Hah! alf a mile ahead..
M	ENRY	he King of England defeated by a humble fawn.
F	ANNE	Hah!
M	COURTIER	Please, your Majesty. It's not safe.
M	T	the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air.. HENRY slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of
M	PHYSICIAN	It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no broken bones..
M	SIR THOMAS	My daughter Anne is here. Would like to apologise.
M	ENRY	No! Get her away from me!
M	HENRY	And who are you?
F	MARY	Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister.
M	HENRY	You've been here all week-end?
F	MARY	Yes, your Grace.
M	HENRY	Really? How could I have overlooked you?
F	MARY	Next to Anne, it's easy to do.
M	HENRY	Nonsense. Tell me about yourself. You're married?
F	MARY	Yes, your Grace. To William Carey.
M	ENRY	From Wolsey's office?
F	MARY	Yes, your Grace.
M	HENRY	Then why haven't I seen you at court?
F	MARY	Because I have persuaded him to spend a year or two here first. We have a small manor and some land. Nothing much. But enough to start a family.
M	HENRY	A charmed life in the country? Away from it all?
F	MARY	Yes.
M	HENRY	Everything I would have wished for myself. But then my brother died. And duty called.
M	HENRY	You don't think he'll miss court? A young, ambitious man?
F	MARY	He says not, your Majesty.
F	MARY	But, if he ever changed his mind, I would always support him.
M	HENRY	Well said. Strapped and bandaged, HENRY is helped onto his horse. Beside
M	HENRY	Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We'll take good care of your boy.. And Thomas..
M	HENRY	You'll take care of that matter?
M	SIR THOMAS	Consider it done, your Majesty.
M	M	Y MARY and ANNE are sitting together. Presently the door opens,
M	STAFFORD	Your Father wishes to see you.
M	STAFFORD	Just Mary. An intimidating atmosphere. Dogs lie at the feet of the DUKE of
M	NORFOLK	Mary, I don't know what you said or did - but you obviously made a deep impression on the King. exchanges a look with SIR And he has requested you come to court with immediate effect.
F	ANNE	What?!? WILLIAM STAFFORD watches from the doorway as the DUKE of
M	NORFOLK	ou're to pack and leave first thing in the morning. The King himself has secured you a position in the Queen's household.
F	MARY	ut I don't want to go to court. Nor does my husband.
M	SIR THOMAS	ell her.
M	WILLIAM	The King has also offered me a position. As Gentleman of the Privy Council.
F	MARY	What?
M	SIR THOMAS	Y'hear that? Gentleman of the Privy Council! Attending to the private and personal needs of his Majesty himself! That's the inner sanctum!
F	MARY	But what about our future? Here in the country?
M	NORFOLK	Put it out of your mind. From now on your home is at court.
F	MARY	William, please! Don't you understand what this means?
F	MARY	They will separate us. Put me in different accommodation. Where the King can always...find me.
M	NORFOLK	Happily your husband understands the value of such an opportunity. For us all.
F	MARY	What about Anne? Couldn't she go instead?
M	SIR THOMAS	The way that girl behaved this week-end, she can count herself lucky she still has a home. ANNE'S FACE, outside the door: it's as if a knife had been
M	M	also running down her cheeks. She stares at her husband..
F	MARY	How could he DO this to me? My own father. What if we just refused?
M	WILLIAM	We would be cut off. He made that clear.
F	MARY	But would that be so bad?
F	MARY	Position means nothing to me. Nor wealth. We could find somewhere. A small farm. Away from everything.
M	WILLIAM	You say that now - but when you're older? And our children are grown up? This won't last long. A year. Maybe two. And at the end of that - we'll we have everything we want. It's for our FUTURE.
F	MARY	ut can't you see? Do this, and we might not HAVE a future. MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang',
F	MARY	I'm so sorry..
F	ANNE	What for? You think I want the King? Or to be used and abused by him? No! You're welcome to him. I have my own plans, which don't involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded. MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by KATHERINE of ARAGON, (late-30's), imperious, intimidating,
M	SERVANT	Mary Carey, Ma'am.
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	Who?
M	SERVANT	The new Lady in Waiting.
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	Really? But I was not expecting anyone.
M	ERVANT	Appointed by...his Majesty the King.
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	By my husband? Really?
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	Well, then she must be some kind of gift. He must have seen in her some special talent that would please me. Tell me. What special talent is it that you have? Apart from your obvious youth and beauty? errified, MARY stammers..
F	MARY	I...I..
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	oetry, perhaps?
F	MARY	N-no..
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	Or dressmaking?
F	MARY	I..I..
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	Music! That's it! You compose? Or sing?
F	MARY	..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty.
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	Come, you're too modest. Signor Vasquez.
F	MARY	No..really..I beg you, your Majesty.
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	I command you to SING!!!
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	Bravo! A nightingale! Welcome at court! MARY walks through the packed corridors of court, her face
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	ait! Mary! Stop!
F	JANE	I know that must have been agony, but put yourself in her shoes. She knows the only reason the King has asked you here is because he desires you. For a wife that must be very difficult. She's a good woman. Trust me. J Jane Parker.
F	MARY	Mary Carey.
F	JANE	You have a brother, don't you? George?
F	MARY	Yes.
F	JANE	I've seen him a few times at court. And like him...very well. But I don't think he has noticed me.
F	MARY	I can't imagine. Should I mention you to him?
F	JANE	Would you?
F	MARY	Of course. Happily. A large dusty yard, where KNIGHTS train for combat, and practise
M	GEORGE	Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course I have. How could I not? She looks like a goat.
F	MARY	Well, she likes you, and asked me to give you this..to remember her by.
M	GEORGE	Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or that you forgot. There is something about that woman that makes me feel...
F	MARY	And our sister? Any word?
M	GEORGE	ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
F	MARY	Yes, I know.
M	GEORGE	And no amount of interventions on my behalf would make her believe you hadn't done it intentionally.
F	MARY	But you KNOW I would never do anything like that.
M	GEORGE	I know.
M	GEORGE (cont'd)	Just give her time. She'll come round. MARY enters her room, and closes the door. She begins
M	HENRY (O.S.)	Please, don't be alarmed. ENRY I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so I might say a few words to you in person.
M	HENRY	I hope your accommodation is comfortable. I realise it's no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country.. But please, give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here.. HE The moment I met you, I realised I..
M	HENRY	What are you..?
M	HENRY	I am sorry. You obviously misunderstand me. The DUKE of NORFOLK stares in disbelief at MARY. His dogs lie
M	NORFOLK	What? If all the King wanted was coition, he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. What he wants is YOU. To woo you. And be wooed in return. And could'nt you look just a little happier? There isn't a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn't wish to be in your shoes.
F	MARY	Your opinion, Uncle.
F	MARY	Mine is that it's the greatest insult of all.
M	ORFOLK	What?
F	MARY	Asking a whore to have feelings, too. An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass, Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away. In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the In the country church: The PRIEST's eyes become accustomed to
M	PRIEST	Are you there?
M	PRIEST	No one saw you?
F	ANNE	No.
M	PRIEST	You brought the money.
M	PRIEST	And the groom? Is he here?
M	RIEST	Good. Then let us begin. Back at court: the service ends. MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a
F	MARY	George? It's the middle of the night.
M	GEORGE	t's Anne.
F	MARY	hat?
M	GEORGE	he's married Henry Percy!
F	MARY	What?
M	GEORGE	In secret. Without telling anyone!
F	MARY	Oh, no...!
M	GEORGE	You don't look pleased.
F	MARY	Why would I be pleased?
M	GEORGE	It would make her the future Duchess of Northumberland. Our sister! But they'll never allow it, don't you see? He's already precontracted to Mary Talbot, and if word of the consummation gets out her reputation will be ruined..
F	MARY	...I have to tell Father. Before it's too late..
M	GEORGE	What?
M	GEORGE	Mary..! Wait! Come back! A FAMILY MEETING: ANNE and HENRY PERCY, (the HANDSOME YOUNG
M	SIR THOMAS	What were you thinking? The marriage of a senior noble is a matter of state. Something only the King can decide..
M	NORFOLK	Who knows about this?
F	ANNE	No one.
M	NORFOLK	Then that is how it shall remain. Forever.
F	ANNE	But you cannot undo what has been done before God. And consummated too.
M	NORFOLK	WHAT?
M	SIR THOMAS	There have been improper intimacies, too?
F	ANNE	I have lain with my husband. There is nothing improper about it..
M	NORFOLK	SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter I'd thrash you within an inch of your life..
M	SIR THOMAS	The boy will return to Northumberland - where he will marry the Talbot girl. As arranged.
M	ORFOLK	As for you. You will go to France and stay there until you have learned your lesson.
F	MARY	What?
M	ORFOLK	How could you do this to your sister? You know full well her friendship with the King is at an extremely delicate stage. Any scandal or black mark against Mary's name now could be fatal.
M	NORFOLK	You will join the court of the French Queen. And stay there until your father has forgiven you. MARY paces anxiously in the corridor. Presently, ANNE emerges
F	ANNE	ou told them, didn't you? How COULD you?
F	MARY	Because you would never have got away with it. And it would have ruined your prospects forever. Believe me. I did it for your good.
F	ANNE	Really? For MY good? I'll try to remind myself of that. While I'm in exile. And you're here, in the King's bed, and unchallenged for our father's affection. That it was for MY good. Not yours.
F	MARY	ANNE, wait..! ANNE storms out. GEORGE shoots MARY a look, "I'll deal with A grand MASQUE BALL. We're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom.
M	MASKED MAN	Why look so glum, Mary?
F	MARY	What reason have I to be happy?
M	MASKED MAN	ou have two men, the King of England and I, both fighting for your love.
F	MARY	Do I know you?
M	MASKED MAN	You know me, Mary - but not half as well as I know you. I know you better than anyone here. And love you better than anyone here, too. And if God had made ME your husband instead of William Carey, one thing I know.. I would never have let you go.
F	MARY	Wait! Who ARE you? M
M	ASKED MAN #2	Ah! Who have we here?!? M MARY My name is Kindness.
M	MASKED MAN #2	wonder, will you be kind to me?
F	MARY	What is it you desire?
M	MASKED MAN #2	our love, fair Lady.
F	MARY	You demand a great deal.
M	MASKED MAN #2	No more than I would give in return.
F	MARY	It is easy for a man to declare love from behind a mask.
M	ASKED MAN #2	ut if I remove it, you might reject me.
F	MARY	If your feelings were sincere, I would never reject you.
M	MASKED MAN #2	But you do not know who I am? I could be ugly. Or poor.
F	MARY	o matter how you looked. Or who you were.
M	MASKED MAN #2	Really? Then I shall hold you to your word. And unmask..!
F	MARY	Your Majesty..!
M	HENRY	he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms! Call my physicians..! `Thump', the doors open, and MARY is carried into the King's
M	ENRY	Go! Leave us! Go!
F	MARY	Thank you, your Grace.
M	HENRY	`Henry', please. The first rule of this room, is to leave `Your Grace's' and `Your Majesty's' outside.
M	HENRY	Is there anything I can bring you?
F	MARY	No.
M	HENRY	Nothing to increase your comfort or well- being?
F	MARY	You might ask your servants to bring me some water.
M	HENRY	There. There ARE no servants.
F	MARY	So, this is it? This is where the King of England sleeps?
M	HENRY	And reads. And writes. And finds a few moments each day... ...for himself. You look surprised?
F	MARY	I am. I suppose it's more..
F	MARY	..simple than I imagined.
M	ENRY	There's no need for show. I am only ever here alone.
F	MARY	And yet you invite me here?
M	HENRY	Because I trust you.
F	MARY	You hardly know me.
M	HENRY	A man in my position develops an instinct. You would never lie, could never lie to me.
F	MARY	No.
M	HENRY	I also sense...that you might relish an opportunity to be yourself, too.
F	MARY	Yes.
M	HENRY	Well, here you only say what you like, do what you like. M MARY Very well.
F	MARY	I'd like an apple, please.. ..Henry.
F	MARY	Now it's your turn.
M	HENRY	What?
F	MARY	To say something, or do something you couldn't outside.
M	HENRY	There are many things I cannot admit to in public. Sadness, for example. And loneliness.
F	MARY	But when you are loved as much as you are? How can you be lonely? Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage?
F	MARY	Yes. I do now.
M	ENRY	married my brother's widow because my father ordered it. As a duty. To keep the alliance with Spain. And she is a remarkable woman. And wife.
M	HENRY	But I never looked at her or longed for her the way I do you.
M	HENRY	Imagine how different it might have been. For both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves.. HENRY and MARY, entwined in one another's arms, as the sun Several hours later:
M	TAFFORD	Good morning. S TAFFORD jumps to his feet. Waking rapidly..
M	STAFFORD	I have orders to bring you to your father.
F	MARY	Well, we'd better not keep him waiting. The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by
M	NORFOLK	Well..?
M	NORFOLK	Did he have you?
F	MARY	Yes.
M	NORFOLK	More than once?
M	NORFOLK	You'd better get used to talking about it. Once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more.
F	MARY	Yes. More than once.
M	NORFOLK	So he was satisfied?
F	MARY	I believe so, Uncle.
M	NORFOLK	ood. This is where our work begins. It's one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him.
M	NORFOLK	I want you to keep her spotless, hair washed every day. She must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion. She must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That's how he likes his women. And if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost killed her. `Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a
M	HENRY	The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. ..I'd like to name her after your daughter. The "Mary Boleyn".
M	SIR THOMAS	Majesty! I'm...I'm speechless..
M	HENRY	onsense. She's an angel. It's the least she deserves. And if there's anything else I can do for YOU, my friend..as an expression of my gratitude..let me know. S
M	SIR THOMAS	s it happens..there is one thing.
M	HENRY	Name it.
M	SIR THOMAS	ur son, George. He's of an age now..
M	HENRY	You want me to make him a match?
M	SIR THOMAS	Yes, your Majesty.
M	HENRY	Do you have anyone in mind?
M	SIR THOMAS	There is one lady, Sir..
M	HENRY	Go on..
M	SIR THOMAS	Who I fear is too high-born for us. And following the unfortunate matter between Anne and Henry Percy, I didn't want my children to overreach themselves again..
M	HENRY	verreach themselves?
M	HENRY	One is currently in the King's bed. If they are good enough for me, I suggest they're good enough for anyone else. So.. Who is it? Jane Parker..? GEORGE BOLEYN, visibly shocked and distressed, stands in front
M	EORGE	I beg you, Father. No.
M	SIR THOMAS	She's well connected, her father is cousin to the King. And there's money, too.
M	GEORGE	But must I actually...marry her?
M	SIR THOMAS	thought you had ambitions for this family. G EORGE I do.
M	SIR THOMAS	And that you wish to make a contribution yourself. Not just stand back and watch your sisters.
M	SIR THOMAS	Then my advice would be to start behaving like a man. A real man. Do I make myself clear?
M	GEORGE	Yes, Sir. MUSICIANS play. We're at GEORGE's wedding. Attended by the KING
M	SIR THOMAS	For God's sake, it's the wedding of our youngest child attended by the King of England and the greatest Lords in the Land. Would a smile be too much to ask?
M	LADY ELIZABETH	What's to smile about? I'm a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like he's been condemned to death.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	Another banished abroad, in disgrace. And a third whoring in public with an adulterer.
M	SIR THOMAS	For the moment she's happy.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	But will she be happy when he leaves her? Because you know that's how it will end.
M	SIR THOMAS	Only God knows how anything will end.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	God..? He turned his back on all this a long time ago.
M	WILLIAM	You're in love with him, aren't you?
F	MARY	illiam, you're drunk.
M	WILLIAM	How is it? With him?
F	MARY	He pleases me. Is that what you want to hear?
M	WILLIAM	What does he do to you? Tell me. I want to know..
M	WILLIAM	I know you look at me with contempt. But I had no choice. Your father insisted I stand aside. What was I expected to do?
F	MARY	Say `no', husband. That was all you had to do. HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of ...that she has fallen in love. The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open
M	P	resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK stare at MARY. Also
M	SIR THOMAS	Are you certain?
F	MARY	Yes.
M	SIR THOMAS	n that case...I suppose...someone should tell the King. Shooting through a half-open door..
M	SIR THOMAS (O.S.)	Keep them shut...still shut.. A blindfolded MARY is led through doors by SIR THOMAS..into a
M	SIR THOMAS	Now open!
M	SIR THOMAS	There's more. Thanks to you, I am to become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount.
M	SIR THOMAS (cont'd)	In addition, we have received a number of new grants and estates. So our debts are paid off.
M	LADY ELIZABETH	Just be aware. These `gifts', this `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes. These rooms belonged to the Duke of Buckingham. Once the King's closest friend. Now his head rots on a spike..
M	SIR THOMAS	Because he committed treason.
M	ADY ELIZABETH	But what is `treason'? It's anything the King or his lawyers decide it to be. Anything that offends him, or causes him displeasure. And can you assure me we'll never do that?
M	SIR THOMAS	Pay her no heed.. MARY wakes up. She gets out of bed. She goes to the window and MARY lies on the bed being examined by several PHYSICIANS. SIR
M	PHYSICIAN	Happily, the baby lives. She's not miscarried. S SIR THOMAS's face. Overcome with relief..
M	PHYSICIAN	But the placenta is weak. For the sake of the child..
M	PHYSICIAN	She must begin her lying-in immediately.
F	MARY	What?
F	MARY	But I'm only three months.. Darkness. The KING stands at the foot of MARY's bed. He is
M	HENRY	ou poor girl. All alone in here. But the time will fly by.
F	MARY	Will it? It's six months?
M	HENRY	I know. But the most important thing is a healthy child. I'll come and see you as often as I can. I promise. H ENRY kisses MARY, then goes. An archery competition is in progress. But HENRY pays no The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands
M	NORFOLK	For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs. What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is absent.
M	NORFOLK	What? Speak..
M	SIR THOMAS	It's just...I was going to suggest Anne.
M	NORFOLK	You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now?
M	SIR THOMAS	I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed. MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..
F	MARY	Why?
M	GEORGE	I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough.
F	MARY	But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else.
M	GEORGE	They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance.
F	MARY	But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine. Why DO they make this room such a dungeon? Does it really need to be this dark?
M	GEORGE	Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. Besides, the most important thing is..
M	GEORGE	The three of us will be together again. The thunder of galloping horses. The RIDERS and the WOMAN gallop through villages, spraying mud. The RIDERS and the WOMAN ride in silhouette against a perfect HENRY and several of his COURTIERS return from a hunting trip. A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation H ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation.
M	HENRY	What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think!
M	BRANDON	It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing.
M	HENRY	I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly!
M	SIR THOMAS	It's my elder daughter, Anne, your Majesty. She has returned to court.
M	HENRY	What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one that almost killed me? You allowed her back?
M	SIR THOMAS	The time abroad has done her good, your Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much improved.
M	HENRY	Really..?
M	HENRY	Well, come on. Where are you, other Boleyn girl? Show your face.
M	HENRY	So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we might hear and judge for ourselves?
F	ANNE	I was just giving my thoughts on the new French King.
M	HENRY	Which are..?
F	ANNE	That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.
M	HENRY	Hah!
F	ANNE	And is SO consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think.
M	HENRY	eally? And who is this rival?
F	ANNE	A neighbouring King, who's name one is forbidden to mention at court. Whose reputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams.
F	ANNE	Whose armies and navy thwart his every endeavour. Whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and wide.
F	ANNE	In order to restore his confidence, this French King spends a fortune on anything that glitters, on building of castles with large towers..
F	ANNE	But these symbols of wealth and virility fail to convince. Talk among the ladies at court in France suggests..
M		stops herself...
M	HENRY	What?
F	ANNE	That in this department too, the King has his shortcomings. SIR THOMAS beams with excitement and satisfaction...
M	SIR THOMAS	You should have seen the Seymours! Their faces!
M	SIR THOMAS	They must have thought that with you out of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale-faced thing of theirs, Jane...
M	SIR THOMAS (cont'd)	But Anne put pay to that. Last night, the King only had eyes for us Boleyns.
F	MARY	Or HER, you mean.
M	SIR THOMAS	What?
F	MARY	'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much.
M	SIR THOMAS	n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you.
F	MARY	Really? Then ask yourself this. If she is really so concerned for my well-being... since she returned? HENRY and several of his closest COURTIERS are sparring close- AFTERWARDS: HENRY and his COURTIERS, (among them GEORGE), are
M	HENRY	You're a fortunate man, George. To be blessed with G two such sisters.
M	EORGE	Yes, my Lord.
M	ENRY	Tell me. Are they as different in temper as they are in looks?
M	GEORGE	Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct virtues. Mary for example..
M	HENRY	I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about Anne's.
M	GEORGE	Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say `difficult'.
M	ENRY	Headstrong. With a fiery temper.
M	GEORGE	But with it comes great passion, too. It's both the best and the worst thing about her. There are no half measures with Anne.
M	HENRY	Careful, you'll make me think I chose the wrong Boleyn girl.
M	GEORGE	Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the right choice. You will have a serene, happy, life with her. The risk is with Anne, it might be like being caught in a wild summer storm.
M	HENRY	Is that so..?
M	HENRY	storm, you say..? A small, precious-looking GIFT BOX sits on a table.
M	ERVANT	From the King, madam.
F	ANNE	Open it.
F	ANNE	I said `open it.'
F	ANNE	Now close it again. And send it back. You heard me. The SERVANT nervously stands in front of the KING, holding the
M	HENRY	She did what?
M	SERVANT	Sent it back, your Grace.
M	HENRY	Sent it back? A ROYAL MESSENGER, in the King's livery, holding a larger, more ANNE shakes her head, and sends the gift back. She looks The MESSENGER stands in front of the KING, holding the rejected
M	HENRY	What? Again? The same ROYAL MESSENGER walks towards the BOLEYN house. This Again, ANNE shakes her head, and sends the gift back. The KING is in a meeting with several AMBASSADORS on an `Crash', the KING, flanked by several of his most intimidating The KING bursts in. Everyone leaps to their feet. SERVANTS stop
M	LADY ELIZABETH	Your Majesty.
M	HENRY	Your daughter. Where is she?
M	LADY ELIZABETH	Mary..?
M	HENRY	Anne! ANNE hears the KING's voice. Her eyes widen. She looks down. ANNE, who is not properly dressed for the KING, rushes back to
M	HENRY	Anne.. A
F	ANNE	Your Grace?
M	HENRY	You received my gifts?
F	ANNE	Yes.
M	HENRY	And? They did not please you?
F	ANNE	On the contrary, my Lord. They pleased me greatly.
M	HENRY	Then why did you return them? ANNE steps into the corridor. Closes the door behind her.
F	ANNE	ecause my sister lies in bed with your child. If you wish to please me, Sir, then send her the gifts you send me.
M	HENRY	I have shown Mary enough kindness and generosity. It's you I want, Anne.
F	ANNE	beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What has changed so?
M	HENRY	YOU. Don't you see? YOU have changed.
F	ANNE	But Mary is still the mother of your child. And even if she weren't..
M	ENRY	What?
F	ANNE	How could I forget that you chose her above me when we first met? You liked her better.
M	HENRY	Not true..
F	ANNE	Either way, I could never betray my own sister.. AN Now I beg you, leave me. This is too difficult to bear.
M	HENRY	You see! The same pain as mine! It proves you feel the same way!
F	ANNE	Perhaps. But since it can never come to anything..
M	HENRY	Let me decide that. For now, you have given me hope. H ENRY goes on bended knee, kisses her hand, and goes. ANNE is SIR THOMAS is asleep. The sound of voices. A commotion outside.
M	STAFFORD	Sir Thomas! It's Mary..! MARY cries out in pain. The contractions become stronger. The DUKE of NORFOLK, SIR THOMAS, and GEORGE BOLEYN arrive in
M	SIR THOMAS	Does the King know?
M	GEORGE	He's on his way.
M	SIR THOMAS	Any moment, your Grace.
M	HENRY	Anne..
M	HENRY	Anne, I love you..
F	ANNE	Your Grace, this is not the time..
M	HENRY	I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking about you. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep..
F	ANNE	But how could I ever TRUST you?
F	ANNE	When I have seen how you have betrayed first your wife. And now my sister.
M	HENRY	I vow from this moment forth I will never lie with my wife, or speak to your sister again. I will do anything you ask..
F	ANNE	Then don't acknowledge the child.
M	HENRY	What?
M	PHYSICIAN	A boy!
M	SIR THOMAS	It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong, healthy boy.
F	ANNE	What my sister has given you, I could, too.
F	ANNE	Very well. M MARY Henry..? My Lord..? `Crash', SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst into the study, angrily
M	NORFOLK	Damn you! Three years we've been working on this! Not a single detail was left to chance! And now, in the moment of our greatest glory..
M	NORFOLK	All I can say is you'd better have a plan. And it had better work.
F	ANNE	Or what...Uncle?
M	LADY ELIZABETH	Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do about Mary? And the child? Or have we forgotten them already?
F	ANNE	Mary should go back to her husband.
F	ANNE	She has been inconvenienced long enough by this family.
M	ADY ELIZABETH	Fine. Then you can be the one to tell her. A
M	LADY ELIZABETH	I think you've earned that privilege. MARY lies in bed. She looks pale. Exhausted. ANNE stares into the room through a crack in the doorway. MARY looks up as ANNE enters, and freezes..
F	MARY	How can you show your face in here?
F	ANNE	I understand you're angry - but be assured. I did nothing, except remind him of you.
F	MARY	Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately. As revenge. And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done.
F	ANNE	Well, hasn't it?
F	MARY	Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from my experience. Because he'll only do to you what he has done to me.
F	ANNE	Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm a greater thing by far. That he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer.
F	MARY	You'll never get Henry Percy back, if that's what you mean.
F	ANNE	That's not what I mean.
F	ANNE	And don't you ever mention his name to me again. I'll never forget how you betrayed me.
F	MARY	If that's what you think, fine. Tell yourself that.
F	ANNE	I did, sister. Every day for three years. MARY is leaving COURT. Pale. Weak. Her belongings have been MARY and her entourage travel through the countryside in a small The rain continues. MARY's carriage approaches the manor house. MARY sits at the dinner table with her husband, WILLIAM CAREY, W WILLIAM Have you christened the child?
F	MARY	Henry.
M	WILLIAM	I see.
M	WILLIAM	And is he to take my name? Or is he to be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast...
F	MARY	He is to be Henry Carey.
M	WILLIAM	I see.
M	WILLIAM	Well, then, here we are.
M	WILLIAM	I could pretend none of this ever happened. Start again. If you could. MARY lies in bed, her eyes open and staring blankly at the moon
M	M	Gorgeous sunshine. Greenwich Palace at it's most beautiful. HENRY and ANNE walk through the gardens. Out of earshot of the
M	HENRY	Well, I have done what you asked. Will you give yourself to me, now?
F	ANNE	As what?
M	HENRY	My one true mistress. To whom I am loyal above all others?
F	ANNE	But it's not true. You are loyal to the QUEEN above all others.
M	HENRY	My wife? I barely see her.
F	ANNE	But she sits on a throne beside you. Accompanies you to every state function.
M	ENRY	For appearance sakes only. In every other regard, our marriage is a sham.
F	ANNE	Still, she is your WIFE. And ever present. And I feel her eyes on me. And those of her spies.
F	ANNE	And look at us. Forever reduced to meeting in secret like this. Speaking in whispers. Hardly conducive to passion?
M	HENRY	Well, what would you have me do? ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to WOLSEY. We do not ANNE enters a lavish drawing-room, and sits down. She picks up a
M	HENRY	Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the Queen to be sent to a nunnery.
M	HENRY	She will protest, of course. She won't go quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her exile. Which leaves you all alone at court..
M	HENRY	...queen in all but name. Mother to any future heir.
M	HENRY	So, is this assurance enough? Will you give yourself to me now?
F	ANNE	I'd like to. But I'm afraid I find the insult too much to bear.
M	HENRY	What insult?
F	ANNE	Because as long as we remain unmarried, any child I gave you would forever be daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'.
M	ENRY	ut what alternative is there? throws hands up in My love for the Queen may have died, but even you must concede, she is still very much alive. A
F	ANNE	Katherine of Aragon is alive. That woman is not worthy of the title `Queen'.
M	ENRY	Oh, Anne.
F	ANNE	I really do not know why we waste time talking of convents when you could annul the marriage.
M	HENRY	Annul it?
F	ANNE	That woman married two brothers and therefore sinned against God.
M	HENRY	But she never consummated the marriage with my brother.
F	ANNE	They were married six months.
M	HENRY	Arthur was a sick man.
F	ANNE	And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that her position as Queen would never be safe until she bedded your brother. Talk to your advisers. They will tell you as much. ANNE sits in her study working. HENRY appears in the doorway.
M	HENRY	Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
F	ANNE	But that's wonderful.
F	ANNE	Why do you look sad?
M	HENRY	Because she will contest it. Which means putting her on trial. And hearing these delicate matters in public.
F	ANNE	es. But any court made up of YOUR Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour. And declare the marriage invalid.
F	ANNE	hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to remarry. Then I can give myself to you fully. And give you everything you.. ..desire. It's mid-winter. A lone RIDER appears on the snowy crest of the A fire roars. STAFFORD warms himself, staring at MARY's new baby
M	TAFFORD	She's beautiful.
F	MARY	Thank you.
M	STAFFORD	I brought gifts from your family. A night-dress from your mother. This from your Uncle George.
F	MARY	Please be sure to thank them - though one wonders what's kept them so busy that not a single one of them found time to visit the new baby.
M	STAFFORD	It's Anne. She's turning this country on its head. She has persuaded the king to test the validity of his marriage, and put the QueenM on trial.
F	MARY	What?
M	STAFFORD	She continues to hold out. Expertly witholding her favours until...
F	MARY	..until what?
M	STAFFORD	Until he makes her the ultimate offer.
F	MARY	High stakes indeed. MARY follows STAFFORD out to the stables where freshly watered
F	MARY	And my brother George?
M	TAFFORD	Continues to be promoted. As does your Father. I lost track of their latest titles. H
M	STAFFORD	ow is your husband? I heard he was unwell.
F	MARY	He is.
M	STAFFORD	I'm sorry. Mary..! At that precise moment, WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse reaches the top
M	STAFFORD	Whoa.. MARY watches him go, then stops - catches herself feeling A hall filled with LAWYERS and AMBASSADORS from both sides.
M	HENRY	The Queen has insisted a Papal representative be present at the trial. But Wolsey has assured me the trial will proceed for appearance sake only. We have our verdict.
F	ANNE	Then what troubles you?
M	HENRY	One or two friends have refused to lend their support. Among them, Thomas More. And then there's the small matter of my conscience.
F	ANNE	Why? You have justice on your side.
M	HENRY	Do I? HENRY sits at breakfast. Reading official correspondence. Legal SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK storm down a corridor. Their `Crash', the door flies open. SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst in.
M	SIR THOMAS	`Mary Talbot'.
F	ANNE	Who?
M	SIR THOMAS	Mary Talbot!! The girl that married Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned the King, demanding a divorce from her husband( on the grounds.. he can hardly bring himself ...that his prior betrothal to you was actually.. ..consummated.
M	SIR THOMAS	I knew this would come back to haunt us!
F	ANNE	I must go to the King.
M	SIR THOMAS	No! He doesn't want to see you! Or hear a word from your lips! He's far too angry. It seems the only Boleyn he will speak to, the only person who's testimony he will trust in this matter.. ...is Mary.
F	ANNE	Mary? A cemetery in mid-winter. WILLIAM CAREY's coffin is lowered into
M	SIR THOMAS	Mary.
M	SIR THOMAS	We're so sorry. About your husband.. Several MAIDS are assembled, fussing over MARY. Transforming her
M	A	ANNE enters, (unseen by MARY), and ushers everyone out. She
F	ANNE	uch beautiful hair.
F	ANNE	Thank you for coming.
F	ANNE	I hate how this matter has come between us. I wanted to come to see you after your daughter was born, and again when your husband died, but..
F	MARY	It's fine.
F	MARY	Leave me. Please..?
F	ANNE	I'm frightened, Mary. What have I done? The KING sits in his private apartment. He looks up as MARY
M	HENRY	Ah! Mary! Come in.
M	HENRY	Closer.. Into the light.
M	HENRY	The Other Boleyn Girl. I'd forgotten how beautiful you were.
F	MARY	ou asked to see me, your Grace? The BOLEYN FAMILY members are pacing outside. Anxious. ANNE and
F	ANNE	And..? MARY is putting the children to bed, tucking YOUNG HENRY in.
M	OUNG HENRY	Mama? What's the matter?
F	MARY	Nothing. MARY closes the door behind her. ANNE stares at her, then..
F	ANNE	I am forever in your debt.
F	MARY	You owe me nothing, sister. I did it that we may finally draw a line beneath everything that has happened between us.
F	ANNE	hen let it be exactly that. A new start between us. Here at court. Thank you. But I'd rather go back to our home in the country.
F	ANNE	What? That damp old ruin? With no food? Or warmth? Why don't you let your family look after you? Your children would have the best of everything here. They would grow up safe and secure.
F	MARY	ho's that?
M	SIR THOMAS	The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to preside over the Queen's trial.
F	MARY	So, it's true. It's really happening?
F	ANNE	Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need my sister by me side. A huge crowd is assembled. Despite the intimidating presence of We're in a packed courtroom. The room is filled with the
F	MARY	The crowds are with her.
F	ANNE	The crowds have no vote. And the bishops that do are in Wolsey's pocket.
M	ANNE (cont'd)	God, she's coming towards us. it aside, intimidatingly flanked by her LAWYERS..
M	UEEN KATHERINE	So..the Boleyn whores. Two former ladies of mine. Hiding in shadows. What did I do to upset you, that you should turn against me like this?
F	ANNE	You failed to give England an heir.
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	And that upsets you so?
F	ANNE	What upsets the King upsets me.
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	How dare you!
M	CRIER	Katherine, Queen of England, come into court..!
M	QUEEN KATHERINE	ou want me to creep away and become a nun? Well, I shall not. You want me to lie before God and admit my first marriage was consummated? Well, it was not. Q retire and withdraw my daughter's claim as sole rightful heir to the throne? Well I shall not. Not in a thousand years, not if you rack me to within an inch of my life... I am Katherine, Queen of England, the King's one true wife, and mother of the heir to the throne. Beloved of the people, and beloved of a King you have bewitched.
F	KATHERINE	My Lord, how have I offended you? For twenty years, I have been a true, obedient wife. I have loved all those whom you loved, and given you children though it has pleased God to take them away. If there is any just cause that you can allege against me, I will happily depart to my shame and dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my witness, there is none.
M	ATHERINE (cont'd)	So, I beg you, dear husband, to spare me this humiliation. But if you will not, and I am to be tried..
M	HENRY	You are.
F	KATHERINE	..then let it be in a proper court and by the only authority I recognise. His holiness himself.
M	WOLSEY	Since it has pleased the Queen to absent herself from the court, the trial will simply proceed without her. The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled. ANNE paces up and down.
F	ANNE	Wolsey promised the King his verdict. Instead he has humiliated him.
M	SIR THOMAS	But they are continuing with the trial. And the Bishops will still find in the King's favour.
F	ANNE	Yes. But without the Pope's blessing, the result will seem hollow. If only the King would take matters into his own hands.
M	ADY ELIZABETH	And do what? His only option would be to reject the Catholic Church? And his faith would never allow it.
M	SIR THOMAS	Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome would isolate England politically. Leave us at the mercy of the Protestants.
F	ANNE	But the alternative is leaving this country without an heir. Failing in his duty as a King. And risking civil war. S omehow I need to make him understand that it is a fair price for a legitimate heir. One he could hold in his arms..
M	ANNE (cont'd)	A strong, rosy-cheeked boy..
F	MARY	What? HENRY, along with THOMAS CROMWELL and several of his LAWYERS are HENRY walks towards ANNE. And bends so as not to frighten the
M	HENRY	Who's this? ANNE Go, on..
M	YOUNG HENRY	My name is Henry.
M	HENRY	Is it, now? A fine name. And how old are you?
M	YOUNG HENRY	Four, Sir. Is that sword real?
M	HENRY	I think so. Would you like to see it?
M	HENRY	Now, `on guard'. From a window high up, we notice: QUEEN KATHERINE has appeared, HENRY continues to play with the boy. It's clearly a powerful Gradually, other FACES appear at the palace windows.. A clap of thunder. A storm breaks. Rain pours. QUEEN KATHERINE, screaming in protest, surrounded by wailing
F	KATHERINE	How dare you! Take your hands off me.. The door flies open. ANNE is reading, alone. She looks up to see
M	HENRY	Now you will give yourself to me.
F	ANNE	I thought I had made myself clear. Until we are married, there is no questi..
M	HENRY	Silence! Enough of your GAMES! I have torn apart this country for you, gone against every principle in my heart, I've endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced them with the axe...just to be with you.. Now prove to me it was worth the sacrifice.
F	ANNE	Stop, you are hurting me..! That night: ANNE is being groomed by MARY.
F	ANNE	How was he with you? As a lover?
F	MARY	Surprisingly so. Why?
F	ANNE	No reason. A small ceremony. Held in secret. The distant sound of crowds
M	ARCHIBISHOP	Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as your lawful wedded wife..?
M	HENRY	I do. MUSICIANS play in the corner, struggling to drown out the sound
F	ANNE	Did you hear? On the way to the church? They were calling me a witch.
F	MARY	All that will die down as soon as they get to know you.
F	ANNE	But what if it doesn't? What if they hate me forever?
F	MARY	They won't. They will see how much the King loves you, and follow.
F	ANNE	How much the King loves me?
F	MARY	ister, I wonder if you've given any thought..to the matter of my returning to the country. With the children.
F	ANNE	What? No! I need you here more than ever. Besides, as the Queen's sister, you can't live alone out there like some gypsy. We need to make you a proper match.
F	ANNE	What about the Duke of Suffolk?
F	ANNE	All the ladies at court are mad for him. Or Lord Fardingly. Marry him and you'd own half Scotland.. MARY is walking back to her apartments, when WILLIAM STAFFORD
M	STAFFORD	Wait! Mary..
M	STAFFORD	I couldn't help overhearing. And before you agree to any of your sister's matches, let me just say..
M	STAFFORD	..I have saved money...not a lot...but enough. I've my eye on a place in the West...Tatton...near where I grew up..
F	MARY	hat? Stafford?
M	STAFFORD	Mary...I love you. There..I've said it. From the moment I joined your family..
F	MARY	Wait.. MARY It was you, wasn't it? At the masked ball?
M	STAFFORD	Yes.
F	MARY	Oh, Stafford..
M	STAFFORD	Mary..I have watched how your family has treated you.
M	If you came withFFORD(cwould )never	STA me..I ont'd betray you...or take you for granted..I would love you and cherish you to my dying day..
F	MARY	But it's impossible. You know that. Now Anne's Queen, my family would never allow it.
M	STAFFORD	And you would CARE? What THEY think? After everything they have done to you? MARY's face. Lost in thought. STAFFORD's words still ringing in
F	ANNE	God, I look hideous.
M	EORGE	Does it hurt?
F	ANNE	Little nips and stabs.
M	GEORGE	Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt to the next King of England.
F	ANNE	But if it isn't? The King will take that as evidence of God's displeasure. And will turn further against me. He's already become so cold.
F	ANNE	They say you can tell by the shape of the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy or girl?
F	ANNE	What's the matter with her?
F	ANNE	You've been like this for days.
F	MARY	What?
F	ANNE	Mooning. You're not in love, are you?
F	MARY	What? Certainly not..
F	MARY	In love! A darkened room. ANNE screams out. She is in the middle of
M	MIDWIFE	And again, one more..
M	MIDWIFE	It's done, your Majesty..!
F	MARY	Well done...
F	ANNE	And..?
F	MARY	It's a girl!
F	MARY	A beautiful, healthy girl.
F	ANNE	A girl? MARY watches from a distance, as SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK tell the
M	SIR THOMAS	She has named her Elizabeth. After your mother.
M	HENRY	Is the child healthy?
M	SIR THOMAS	Perfectly, Sir.
M	ENRY	Well, if we can have a healthy daughter, we can have a healthy son. ANNE stands by a window, staring out. Her hands wringing with ANNE Who is it?
F	MARY	Lady Somerset, I believe.
F	ANNE	Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador. The day before with the Countess of Salisbury. How could he DO that to me? So SOON?
F	ANNE	Now I know how it must have been for you. MARY is with her children, reading them a bedside story. From You can't ignore me like this. I am your wife! Why don't you just admit it!
M	HENRY (O.S.)	ecause it's not true!
M	ANNE (O.S.)	Liar! I can smell the whore on you! Get away from me! You disgust me! ANNE and MARY are together. ANNE is combing her hair. Strands of
F	ANNE	I struck him today. What am I doing? I am destroying this all on my own..
F	ANNE	I can't sleep at night! And without sleep I cannot think!
F	MARY	Oh, Anne..
F	ANNE	nd it's getting more and more difficult to arouse him. Some nights he cannot do it...at all. I have to resort to ever more disgusting...then he hates himself in the morning...hates me even more for what I made him do...
F	ANNE	It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it. The sound of ugly, loveless sex. Cries of pain. ANNE tries to
M	SIR THOMAS	And..? A magnificent winter party to celebrate ANNE's pregnancy. The
M	EORGE	And so, it's come to this. Our sister is with child, and all England's fate is in the balance.
M	GEORGE (cont'd)	If it's a boy, the King will have been vindicated in getting rid of his first wife, and his authority will be unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if, God forbid, she miscarries.
M	GEORGE	The King will have to move swiftly to silence his enemies. He will claim innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by someone more `acceptable'. And we Boleyns will never be able to show our faces at court again.
F	MARY	That's no bad thing.
F	MARY	Anyone with any sense would have run away from this hell-hole already. As far as they could go.
M	GEORGE	ike the wise William Stafford.
F	MARY	What?
M	GEORGE	You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left for the country. Just like that. Gone to live in some place called..
F	MARY	..Tatton.
M	GEORGE	Where he grew up, apparently. Did you know he came from a better stable than all of us? His grandmother was a Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he never mentioned it. Who'd have guessed?
F	ANNE	I'm fine, thank you. Just a bad dream.
F	ANNE	But fetch my brother and sister, will you?
M	W	hen ANNE sees what lies beneath, she howls in horror. MARY and GEORGE arrive breathlessly in ANNE's room, to find.. Y
F	ANNE	I lost it. Almost without pain. And so fast it was over in a moment.
F	MARY	Oh, Anne..
F	ANNE	ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get rid of it somehow. No one must know.
F	ANNE	It's not the first. Miscarriage.
F	ANNE	They will take it as proof that I cannot bear children. That I am cursed by God. And should be dispensed with.
F	MARY	Why? There's still time. You could sleep with the King, and fall pregnant again. No one would know..
F	ANNE	he King would never lie with me now, and risk damaging the `child' he believes I'm carrying.. Besides, he is barely capable anymore. And I couldn't go through that again.
F	ANNE	No, if I am to survive..I have to take matters into my own hands. I..I don't understand.
F	ANNE	Must I spell it out?
F	MARY	You mean lying with another man?
F	ANNE	Of course.
M	GEORGE	But that would be treason.
F	MARY	esides, where would you find someone you could trust?
F	ANNE	Obviously, it would have to be someone close. Very close..
M	GEORGE	What..? No..!
F	MARY	Stop it, Anne! It's madness..
F	ANNE	Don't you see? This affects all of us. If I go down, so do all of you. The only way to save ourselves..is to do this.. And pray it's a boy.
F	MARY	I can't listen to this.. ...this is monstrous..
F	ANNE	Mary, sit down..
F	MARY	No, Anne! I understand you have had a shock tonight. A terrible shock. But there is no need for this..
F	MARY	Come, George..
F	ANNE	George is staying. He understands this involves the whole family..
F	MARY	No. Come, George..
F	ANNE	George, is STAYING!
F	MARY	I pray for you both.
F	ANNE	Mary! Come back!
M	I	t's JANE PARKER. Who turns, holding her head, covering her MARY runs through the corridors in an agitated state. MARY rushes into her room. She goes to the beds where her
F	MARY	Come on, darling wake up.
M	YOUNG HENRY	Where are we going?
F	MARY	Away from here. Far, far away. ANNE and GEORGE stare at one another. ANNE pours a mug full of MARY and her CHILDREN ride through the night. ANNE and GEORGE are making love. Silent tears are streaming down Afterwards: ANNE and GEORGE lie in silence. ANNE strokes her JANE PARKER gets to her feet. Numb with shock. She stares ahead. MARY arrives in a market village. She asks directions. Then A simple farmhouse, nestling in a valley. MARY stands in front of the door, protectively holding her
M	YOUNG HENRY	Who lives here, Mother?
F	MARY	Someone. A friend. MARY enters, calls out, `Hello?'. No answer.
F	MARY	William?
M	OUNG HENRY	Mama, I'm hungry.
F	CATHERINE	Me, too. The CHILDREN eat hungrily. A clock ticks on the wall.
M	T	F MARY puts CATHERINE to sleep in a bed. YOUNG HENRY is already MARY walks along a corridor. She looks in the bedroom. MARY pours hot water into a bath. The room is thick with steam. WILLIAM STAFFORD and several FARM-HANDS return from working in STAFFORD dismounts his horse. A quizzical look. Then he walks STAFFORD enters his house to see empty bowls of food on the STAFFORD pushes open the door. MARY is in the bath. Washing M T
F	MARY	I'm sorry. I just didn't know where else to go. Time has passed. Winter has become spring. We're in an idyllic
M	RIEST	Do you, Mary, take William as your lawful wedded husband?
F	MARY	I do. A dance is in progress. MUSICIANS play. Fifty or so GUESTS.
F	MARY	What is it?
M	STAFFORD	News from court.
F	MARY	hat? It's Anne. Tell me.. She miscarried the child? ANNE is walking alone. Her MAIDS follow at a distance. Presently Back at the dance. STAFFORD continues..
M	STAFFORD	They say it was deformed...monstrous. She is charged with incest and of summoning the devil. Your brother, too. He has already been sentenced. Anne is in the Tower, awaiting trial. ANNE in a prison cell at the Tower. Frightened. Vulnerable.
F	MARY	I must go.
M	STAFFORD	And do what? George is doomed. For Anne it's only a matter of time.
F	MARY	I can petition the King..
M	STAFFORD	ou think he will listen? It's his own neck he's saving by getting rid of them, can't you see?
M	STAFFORD	Fine, go. But if you do, you might as well kiss your children goodbye. You are Anne's sister. That alone makes you her accomplice and co-conspirator.
F	MARY	I have no choice. Anne and George are my family. I cannot desert them.
M	STAFFORD	And what of your new family? Your CHILDREN?
F	MARY	Henry and Catherine have you. Anne and George have no one. I'm sorry.. ANNE is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches,
F	ANNE	It is a sad day for England when the nobles do not rise for their Queen.
M	NORFOLK	And even sadder when that same Queen is charged with adultery and incest.
F	ANNE	Charged is different to convicted, Uncle. Or is it not? In this court?
M	NORFOLK	Master Cromwell, read out the indictment..
M	CROMWELL	The charge is that in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Henry, King of England, his wife, the Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did knowingly commit adultery, high treason and offences against God.
M	NORFOLK	How do you plead?
F	ANNE	Not guilty, my Lord. MARY thunders across bridges, through villages. Urging on her ANNE faces the LORDS, as she makes her case..
F	ANNE	My noble Lords..the love I have for my brother is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up in the same house, nursed when sick, played games as children, shared life's celebrations.
F	ANNE	That is the love I have for him. Not what you suggest.
M	ANNE (V/O)	Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But never forget that your verdicts will be judged again by God, in the greatest court of all..
M	NORFOLK (V/O)	My Lords, the time has come to cast your vote. MARY gallops through shallow streams, spraying water.. ANNE watches on as each LORD takes it in turn to get to his
M	NORFOLK	Guilty.
M	NORFOLK	In which case, the burden falls on me to pass sentence. A terrified GEORGE BOLEYN is led to the scaffold. He is watched MARY reaches the outskirts of London. Gallops through villages.. GEORGE BOLEYN's eyes are covered with a cloth. He puts his head MARY arrives in time to hear the ROAR from the crowds. She
F	MARY	ho was it? HENRY walks through corridors arm in arm with JANE SEYMOUR,
M	HENRY	Mary..? ENRY Leave us.
M	HENRY	ALL of you! His private room. His sanctuary. Where he took her before. The
F	MARY	Your Majesty.. I understand my family has offended you. But having taken my brother today, I beg you to spare my sister.
M	HENRY	Oh, Mary...
F	MARY	I realise you must replace Anne as Queen. But must she die, too?
M	HENRY	She has been tried and found guilty.
F	MARY	You could send her away.
M	ENRY	I am bound by the law.
F	MARY	You could send her to a nunnery. No one would know.
M	HENRY	Anne? To a nunnery?
F	MARY	There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of France did it, too. When his wife could not conceive.
M	HENRY	The French Queen was a blameless woman. Your sister a witch.
F	MARY	I understand Anne has offended you. I ask only that if there is any regret you might..feel yourself.
M	ENRY	What?
F	MARY	For your part in the matter..
F	MARY	..does not unduly colour your thinking. Killing Anne will not make it go away. It would only make it worse.
M	HENRY	How could I have made that mistake? Choosing her over you?
M	HENRY	o. I will reflect on the matter. A team of CARPENTERS erect gallows and scaffolding. Hammers n the hill: a blood-stained chopping block is put into place. The doors to ANNE's cell open. ANNE looks up. In the doorway is
F	MARY	Oh, Anne..
F	ANNE	How has it come to this?
F	MARY	Ssshhhhh. A LIEUTENANT gives a nod. SOLDIERS raise a barrier, and allow ANNE looks out through a narrow window. Her intense, fearful
F	ANNE	They're letting the crowds in.
F	MARY	It's all right. You will be spared. The King as good as gave me his word.
F	ANNE	The King saw you?
F	MARY	Yes.
F	ANNE	We all made a mess of that, didn't we? We all underestimated little Mary.
F	ANNE	I don't think he ever stopped loving you.
F	MARY	That's not true.
F	ANNE	It is. He never loved me in the same way. And deep down you know it.
F	ANNE	You should have been Queen. You even gave him a son. But instead all this has happened because.. Because I couldn't bear to be the Other Boleyn Girl.
F	ANNE	And now look?
F	ANNE	Hold me..
F	ANNE	You'll look after Elizabeth?
F	MARY	It will be all right. Trust me.
F	ANNE	he couldn't ask for a better moth...
F	MARY	e will spare you. I am sure of it. A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is M MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and
F	ANNE	I...I come here to die...a loyal subject..
F	MARY	Come on..
F	ANNE	..I..I do not blame the King. Never was there a more just or goodly Lord..
F	ANNE	..I beg God's forgiveness and his mercy..
M	CROMWELL (V.O.)	"Madam..." THOMAS CROMWELL, the former assistant to WOLSEY, who has now
M	CROMWELL (V.O.)	..the King has spared you because of his respect and affection for you and because you are the mother of his son." MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by
M	CROMWELL (V.O.)	"But you risked your life coming to court and you are advised you not to do so again. You will not be shown the same clemency a second time. Your sister Anne was tried and found guilty, her crimes were high treason and she deserves to die. Cromwell."
F	MARY	No! SIR THOMAS BOLEYN sits by a window. Staring out at the fields We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of
