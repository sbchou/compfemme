M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is restricted to first cl...
M	JAMES EARL JONES	Is this what you're looking for?
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there anything I can get you?
M	JAMES EARL JONES	Scotch, blended. Straight.
M	PASQUAL	They say birds can't fly this high.
M	JAMES EARL JONES	They say only angels can.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Shall I pour your scotch?
M	JAMES EARL JONES	No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.
M	JAMES EARL JONES	Ah, c-5. The most dangerous explosive material ever invented. Hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks.
M	PASQUAL	Be careful with it, huh?
M	JAMES EARL JONES	Another movie from an old TV show?
M	PASQUAL	Well, what're you gonna do?
M	JAMES EARL JONES	Walk out.
M	PASQUAL	That's very funny.
M	JAMES EARL JONES	No. It isn't.
M	JAMES EARL JONES (CONT'D)	EVERYONE! FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!
M	JAMES EARL JONES	PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVE COMPANY. PASQUAL WHAT?
M	PASQUAL	You crazy bastard!
M	JAMES EARL JONES	I think you mean crazy bitch.
F	DYLAN	Don't need this anymore.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	But I sure could use this.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Damn I hate to fly.
M	BOSLEY	Well, Angels, the experimental explosives are back in the hands of the government, and the free world can breathe just a lit-tle bit easier tonight, thanks to you three.
F	NATALIE	And thanks to you, too, Bos.
F	ALEX	We couldn't have redirected the flight path without your help.
M	BOSLEY	Nothing a little teamwork can't do. At least, that's what Charlie's always telling us, right ladies?
F	DYLAN	Charlie will be joining us, won't he?
M	BOSLEY	He sends his regrets. But he wanted you to know that dinner is on him, so feel free to celebrate.
F	ALEX	If it's on Charlie, we will.
M	CHARLIE (V.O.)	Once upon a time...
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	... there were three very different little girls.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Who grew up into three very different women.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	With three things in common...
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	They're brilliant. They're beautiful. And they work for me.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	My name is Charlie.
F	DYLAN	Hi. Hi. Okay. I'll be right in.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Not him. Not him, not him, not him.
M	THE VOICE	'Morning starfish.
F	DYLAN	Oh God no.
M	CHAD	Hungry? CHAD C'mon Dylan. You + Me. It's magic.
F	DYLAN	It's a mistake. A horrible, horrible mistake.
M	CHAD	Then how come we keep getting back together? It's fate.
M	CHAD	Is it because I live on a boat? If you don't defuse this bomb, Logan, L.A.'s going to be a new underwater attraction.
M	JASON	Get off my back, Sanchez. I know what I'm doing.
F	ALEX	Which wire? The red one or the blue one?
M	JASON	Marix has a thing for red. Red cars, red boats, red-headed hookers.
F	ALEX	So the red one.
M	JASON	That's why I'm gonna say blue.
F	ALEX	You saved the world again, Logan.
M	JASON	That's my job. I don't think Sanchez would kiss me. He's a forty-year-old man. tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal
F	ALEX	Let's have it rewritten.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	JASON	So when you coming back?
F	ALEX	Not sure. Whenever I can. I'll call you.
M	JASON	Oh, great, that's helpful. I don't get it, what kind of executive assistant is on 24 hour call?
F	ALEX	A very good one.
M	JASON	You ask me, your boss is an asshole. When do I get to meet this Charlie guy, anyway?
F	ALEX	Charlie's not very social.
M	JASON	Yeah, well I think you should quit.
F	ALEX	Charlie needs me.
M	JASON	I need you.
M	P.A.	Mr. Gibbons? We're ready for you on the set.
M	JASON	I gotta go save the world.
F	ALEX	My hero.
M	BOB	What! Natalie, what?
F	NATALIE	I thought you were dead.
F	NATALIE	I thought the police might be here. Or your neighbors. Or your parents, here to identify your remains.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	I saw your car was here, so I knew you weren't carjacked and brutally beaten, left to die on the highway.
M	BOB	I'm not...
F	NATALIE	Hello. Absolutely. I'll be right in.
M	BOB	I'm not dead.
F	NATALIE	But you can understand why I thought so. You missed our date last night. You didn't call or anything. I was just sitting there by myself.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	I can tolerate a lot, but punctuality and attendance, those rank very high in my list of dating priorities.
M	BOB	I can explain.
M	BLONDE	Bobby?
M	BOB	I can explain.
M	ISAAC HAYES	Bobby?
M	BOB	Damn.
F	NATALIE	Just once, I want to date a normal man, without a wife, or a drug addiction, or bondage issues.
F	DYLAN	Here here.
F	ALEX	What? I've got a great relationship.
F	DYLAN	Your boyfriend thinks you're a secretary.
F	ALEX	That way, he doesn't ask about my work.
F	NATALIE	I'm sorry, Bosley. I only made enough for three.
M	BOSLEY	No, that's...That's okay. CHARLIE'S VOICE Good morning, Angels.
M	ANGELS	Good morning, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	I'm sorry to call you back from vacation, but we've got a case that just can't wait.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Meet Eric Knox.
F	NATALIE	He's cute.
M	BOSLEY	He is.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	He's 28-years old, and in three days he'll be a billionaire, when his company, Knox Technologies, goes public.
F	DYLAN	It's good to be him.
F	ALEX	So what's the catch?
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Last night, Knox was kidnapped from his own office.
F	NATALIE	Any ransom?
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	No one's heard a thing from the kidnappers.
M	A WOMAN'S VOICE	They don't want money. They just want to sink our company.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice president of finance for Knox Technologies. She's hired us to find Knox.
M	VIVIAN WU	The initial public offering is in three days. If we don't get Mr. Knox back, or if word gets out that he's missing, the company stands to lose a billion dollars.
M	VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)	We need your help.
F	ALEX	Charlie, where do we start?
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Alex, I want you and Bosley to stake out Roger Corwin.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	For the past year, he's been trying to buy Knox's company and their new browser software. Knox refused to sell. His company, Red Start Systems, has the most to gain from Knox's disappearance.
F	ALEX	Kidnap the founder and you sink the company.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Exactly, Alex. Let's keep our eyes on Mr. Corwin, Angels. If Knox is still alive, Corwin might lead us to him.
F	DYLAN	We're on it.
F	NATALIE	Any chance you can join us, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE (O.S.)	I'd love to, angels, but I've got my hands full this morning.
F	ALEX	This is a transmitter. I'll be able to hear everything you say.
M	BOSLEY	Where do I hide it? I'll be nude.
F	ALEX	Try to get Corwin to talk about the industry, Knox, anything.
M	BOSLEY	Understood.
M	BOSLEY (CONT'D)	I'm going undercover.
F	ALEX	I know. You'll do great.
M	BOSLEY	Hot in here, isn't it?
M	BOSLEY (CONT'D)	Just came here to unwind a little. Business these days is go go go. My company just held an initial pubic offering.
M	BOSLEY (CONT'D)	So, what business are you in?
F	CORWIN	Computers. Software.
M	BOSLEY	Computers, hunh? What do you know about this new browser from Knox Technologies?
M	BOSLEY (CONT'D)	Word on the street is, once they raise capital, they'll rule the industry.
F	CORWIN	I don't see that happening.
M	BOSLEY	Really? Why not? Nice talking with you.
M	MASSEUSE	Please to take off clothes, Mr. Corvin.
F	ALEX	You're carrying a lot of tension along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae. Let me see if I can vork it out.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	The human body is an amazing instrument. Just by activating ze right energy points, you can improve ze circulation, alleviate pain, or...
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	... knock a man unconscious.
F	ALEX	You must have dozed off.
F	NATALIE	Can you not drive my car so fast, Dyl? I'm trying to type.
F	DYLAN	I drive too fast. Look who's talking.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Three double doubles, animal style. Fries. Three chocolate shakes.
F	NATALIE	Here's Corwin's itinerary.
F	DYLAN	Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight. I only wish we had a clue to go on.
F	NATALIE	Hold that thought.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Uh, hello? Expensive equipment.
F	DYLAN	Sorry.
F	NATALIE	Check this out. New program I just got from a friend in the Bureau. We take that footage from the kidnapping...
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	... isolate the part of the suspect's face that's revealed, then retriangulate his bone structure...
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	... and voila! We've got a composite.
F	DYLAN	Sweet. Now we've got someone to look for.
F	ALEX	Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot with that open head wound.
F	DYLAN	The average investor sees technology stocks as discrete entities, "This one is up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's only through derivative analysis that one sees the real power of that sector.
M	BROKER GUY	Which analysis method do you prefer?
F	DYLAN	Well, there are so many options. I mean, who can say what the one best choice is?
F	NATALIE	Keppler-Wilson.
F	DYLAN	For my money, Keppler-Wilson is a strong choice.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Thanks.
F	NATALIE	Anytime. Anytime what?
F	NATALIE	Anytime, day or night, I am... excited ... to be handing out champagne.
F	DYLAN	He's cute.
F	NATALIE	I'm working.
F	DYLAN	Sixty-five percent of relationships begin in the workplace.
F	NATALIE	He's a bartender. I need dependable. I need reliable. I need a Volvo man.
F	NATALIE	Miss! Miss! I'd love some champagne. Why don't you get some more? PETE Sorry.
F	NATALIE	What are you reading?
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	That's the new Michio Kazura. That's not even out in America.
M	PETE	You know Michio Kazura?
F	NATALIE	Hello? Warriors of the Broken Earth? Classic.
M	PETE	I know. I just moved back from Tokyo. It was the biggest thing since Haikiri Nomura.
F	NATALIE	Tomuru nasgawa ishi Tokyo sen! PETE Nagada quing-gong ni. Ni zeru. that. Natalie takes her tray and reluctantly
F	DYLAN	Ask him out. Ask him out.
F	NATALIE	I'm Natalie.
M	PETE	Pete. Good to meet you.
F	NATALIE	Listen, there's an animation festival at the Egyptian this week. I was wondering if you might want to...
M	PETE	Tomorrow night? Eight o'clock?
F	NATALIE	I'll meet you there.
F	DYLAN	Pardon me.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Natalie. Nine o'clock. Thin man.
F	NATALIE	I'm on it.
F	NATALIE	Vegetarian spring roll?
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Two guns. One ankle, one shoulder.
F	DYLAN	You call it.
F	NATALIE	You take point. I'll circle behind.
F	DYLAN	Copy.
F	DYLAN	Excuse me? Excuse me, do you know which way the ladies' room is?
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Why do they always run?
F	DYLAN	He's going down.
F	NATALIE	That way.
F	NATALIE	There are times I wish we carried guns.
F	DYLAN	Where's the challenge in that?
F	NATALIE	Hey! Hands off, assh....
F	NATALIE	Okay, to summarize? Damn.
M	BOSLEY	Well. That was easy.
F	NATALIE	No, it wasn't.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	I've seen this before, he's scrambling his calls through a secondary location.
M	BOSLEY	In English?
F	NATALIE	We need to tap this phone line at the source, THEN we'll know where his calls were coming from.
F	DYLAN	503? That's not local, where is it?
F	NATALIE	Bos, can we check a directory?
F	ALEX	Don't bother. I know where it is. I used to spend every winter there.
F	NATALIE	Hey look! Mechanical bull.
F	DYLAN	Eyes on the prize, Nat. We gotta tap the phones.
F	ALEX	That looks like our target. I'm gonna need a distraction.
F	DYLAN	I think that can be arranged.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Three shots of tequila, please. And one Tom Collins.
M	REDNECK	Hey baby, why don't you ditch that stiff and come sit on ma lap?
F	DYLAN	Ooh, that is an enticing offer. But I got a better idea. How about a shot contest? My treat?
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Bartender? Bring ten shots of tequila over to my table. And keep em coming.
M	THE MECHANICAL BULL	
F	NATALIE	Mind if I try?
F	DYLAN	Hey, I've got an idea. Now let's have a chair throwing contest.
M	REDNECK	Hunh?
F	DYLAN	Chair throwing? Never heard of it? You just pick up your chair and throw it as far as you can.
M	THUG ONE	We expecting somebody?
F	DYLAN	Guten Tag!
F	NATALIE	Guten Morgen!
F	DYLAN	Guten Nacht!
M	DYLAN AND NATALIE	Guten Freund! but occasionally one of the girls touches the
M	THUG TWO	They got the wrong address.
M	THUG ONE	Shut up.
F	ALEX	Where's Knox?
M	KNOX	Who are you?
F	ALEX	The calvary. Giddy up.
F	ALEX	Sorry. Wrong room. Back! Run!
M	BOSLEY	Alex, what's your status?
F	ALEX	Good news: I found Knox. Bad news: I found company.
F	DYLAN	This way.
F	ALEX	They're coming after us.
F	DYLAN	We were expecting that.
F	NATALIE	Okay, new problem. Thoughts, suggestions, points to consider?
M	BOSLEY	I don't suppose giving up would be a...
F	DYLAN	Right!
F	NATALIE	There is no right.
F	DYLAN	There! the ground could stop in a cliff.
F	DYLAN	Where are we?
F	ALEX	It's a bobsled run.
F	NATALIE	If it goes down the mountain, that's all I need.
F	ALEX	Hard left! HARD LEFT!
M	KNOX	Is this part of the plan?
F	DYLAN	Yes. Except for the bobsled run, and the backwards part, it's going exactly according to plan.
F	DYLAN	I think we're in the clear.
F	DYLAN	Or maybe not.
F	NATALIE	Oh God, no.
F	DYLAN	What is it?
F	NATALIE	I have a date with Pete. Right now.
F	DYLAN	Ouch.
F	ALEX	HARD RIGHT!
F	DYLAN	Call him, he'll totally understand.
F	NATALIE	"Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a billionaire."
F	ALEX	Hard left!
F	NATALIE	I'll sound like a flake. I can't stand flakes.
F	DYLAN	He will so give you the second chance.
F	NATALIE	You think?
F	DYLAN	Hello, I saw the way he looked at you.
F	ALEX	We're at the bottom!
F	DYLAN	Well done.
M	KNOX	Thanks.
M	BOSLEY	I think that went very well. Charlie should send me on more missions.
F	ALEX	We couldn't have done it without you, Bos.
F	DYLAN	Cocktail?
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Good work, Angels. Not only did you save Knox, you saved his company as well.
F	DYLAN	I think that earns us a vacation.
F	NATALIE	Say, Fiji?
F	ALEX	Any special guy you were thinking of inviting?
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Sorry, Angels. Our work is only half-done.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Meet your new client, Eric Knox.
M	KNOX	First off, thank you. You rescued me, for which I am eternally grateful.
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	But there's still a problem. Whoever kidnapped me wasn't just trying to screw up our IPO. They also stole the proprietary software for our new web browser. I'm sure it was Roger Corwin, but I need proof.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	That's where you come in, Angels.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	We need to break into Red Star's computer systems to see if Mr. Knox's software is indeed being converted for Red Star's use.
F	NATALIE	Sounds like a plan.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red Star's headquarters are as tightly guarded as a military facility. We're going to need reconnaissance on their mainframe computer system, and the best way to get that is through Mr. Corwin himself.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	We need to pin a camera on him to get footage of the inside of the building. Thanks to Alex's work at the health spa, we know that Corwin will be at the San Diego Speedway on Thursday. Get close to him Angels, but don't tip your hand.
F	ALEX	Consider it done.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Dylan, I need you to arrange for Mr. Knox's security. I'd hate to have him kidnapped again.
F	DYLAN	Absolutely. But we'd all feel safer if you could join us, Charlie.
M	CHARLIE	I'd love to Angels. But I'm in a bit over my head at the moment.
F	DYLAN	We're good.
F	DYLAN	I've got surveillance on all the windows. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone.
F	DYLAN	Also, stay away from the windows.
M	KNOX	They're bullet-proof. The last owner was paranoid.
F	DYLAN	Lucky for us.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	This is a panic button. Press it and one of us can be here in ten minutes.
M	KNOX	Which one of you?
F	DYLAN	Whoever's closest.
M	KNOX	I have a better idea.
F	DYLAN	What?
M	KNOX	Stay for dinner. I'm a pretty good cook.
F	DYLAN	I can't Mr. Knox. I'm sorry. If you...
M	KNOX	I'm scared.
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	Look, I didn't want to admit it, but I am. I was kidnapped once, and it wasn't fun. I know, you probably have other plans, but it would be very reassuring.
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	Come on, don't make me beg. I'm embarrassed already.
F	DYLAN	Don't be.
F	DYLAN	That's you, hunh? Cute kid. Cute family.
M	KNOX	Thanks. It's the only picture I have of me with my parents. They died a week later.
F	DYLAN	Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea...
M	KNOX	Please, don't apologize. I was too young to understand. I never knew how they died. When I was a kid, when I got shuffled from one foster home to another, I always thought they just disappeared.
F	DYLAN	But...?
M	KNOX	I only found out later, my father was in the military. He and my mother were killed while he was on assignment, somewhere in Eastern Europe. The files were classified, but I read enough to know that he was a good man. Apparently, he was betrayed by one of his own team.
F	DYLAN	Wow. That's a lot for a kid to live with.
M	KNOX	Yeah, but it motivated me, losing my family. It still does. I don't take anything for granted.
F	DYLAN	Boy did I have you pegged wrong.
M	KNOX	How do you mean?
F	DYLAN	Well, to be honest, I thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything. But that's pretty typical. I've got instincts for the job, but when it comes to men? Well...
M	KNOX	I'm glad you don't see me as just a client.
F	DYLAN	Oh. Well, you ARE, so...
M	KNOX	Is there someone you need to be going home to?
F	DYLAN	No. But I...
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	I shouldn't.
M	KNOX	Shouldn't you?
F	DYLAN	No. I shouldn't.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Thank you for dinner, Mr. Knox. And lock the door behind me.
F	CORWIN	What the...?
M	PIT BOSS	NICE RACING! CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE NEVER RACED THIS TRACK BEFORE!
F	NATALIE	BACK WHERE AH'M FROM, WE RACE IN SWAMPS AND BACK ROADS! THIS ALL'S A PIECE A CAKE! I nicked him. Should give you enough time to do the deed.
F	DYLAN	I'm on it.
F	CORWIN	LET'S GO! WE'RE LOSING TIME HERE!
M	THIN MAN	You okay, Boss?
F	CORWIN	No thanks to you! You're supposed to be my head of security! Who is that bitch?!
M	THIN MAN	Don't know. I'll keep an eye out.
F	CORWIN	Yeah. You do that.
M	BOSLEY (O.S.)	Coast is clear, Dylan.
M	BOSLEY	Let's make the switch.
M	TV ANCHOR VOICE	If you're just joining us, we're approaching hour five of a pursuit that has lead us all across the Southland, at speeds up to 80 miles an hour.
M	FEMALE ANCHOR VOICE	Chuck, time and again we hear the question, "Why don't the police just ram the other car, or shoot out the tires?" The LAPD has a policy of hanging back and following unless...
M	TV ANCHOR VOICE	What was that?
M	KNOX	There!
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	That's the room with the mainframe. Everything at Red Star goes through that system.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	So if we want to find proof that Red Star stole Knox's technology, that's the computer to tap.
M	KNOX	Exactly. But they have heavy firewalls and encryption. You can't jack in from outside. You'll have to physically be in that room to get at the data.
F	ALEX	Even if we do get inside, there won't be time to search for it. There's got to be a hundred terabytes of information there. It could take days.
F	NATALIE	So you install a transmitter.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Patch in directly to the relay, broadcast on a high frequency. That way, you can have access to the mainframe from the comfort of your own home. And they have no idea that you can peek inside.
M	VIVIAN WU	That's all fine in theory. But you still have to get inside that room to install it. What about security?
F	ALEX	Red Star has a lot of Government contracts, so security is tight. Key- card badges throughout. Redundant security at all red-line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes. Pervasive video surveillance, lasers, air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping.
M	VIVIAN WU	It sounds impossible.
F	DYLAN	It sounds like fun.
M	NATALIE (V.O.)	Only the two directors can disengage the fail-safe. We have to get their keys.
M	ALEX (V.O.)	Then we have to get back into Red Star. Problem is, their biometric sensors are too good.
M	DYLAN (V.O.)	We need someone's help.
M	A VOICE	Tommy? You gonna let me through or what?
M	TOMMY THE GUARD	Oh. Yeah, sorry Mr. Corwin.
F	ALEX	It's done. Red Star's mainframe is open for business.
F	DYLAN	Champagne, please. Your best.
M	KNOX	Now I know why I hired you. You're the best.
M	VIVIAN WU	I'll have Systems get to work on this right away.
M	BOSLEY	Uh, actually Miss Wu, WE will get to work on this right away. Any evidence we find will be turned over to you AND the proper authorities.
M	VIVIAN WU	I don't think you understand how important that data is, Mr...
M	BOSLEY	Oh, indeed I do. And that's why I'll take very good care of it when I find it.
M	VIVIAN WU	But...
M	KNOX	Vivian, please. Do as the man says.
F	DYLAN	Where you off to, Bos?
M	BOSLEY	Vacation.
F	NATALIE	Uh oh, lemme guess. You're off to chase bikinis at some tropical resort?
M	BOSLEY	Exactly! Fire Island, here I come!
M	BOSLEY (CONT'D)	Goodbye, Angels. Mr. Knox. Ms. Wu.
M	KNOX	More champagne?
F	NATALIE	Have to go. Plans tonight.
F	ALEX	Me too.
M	KNOX	And you?
F	DYLAN	Um... well...
F	NATALIE	Hey Dylan, can we talk to you for a second?
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	There's something going on between you and Knox. Isn't there?
F	DYLAN	So what, so I like him. Is that so wrong?
F	NATALIE	Uh, yeah Dylan, it IS. He's a client. DYLAN WAS a client. We finished the job.
F	ALEX	She's got a point.
F	NATALIE	What? She doesn't have ANY point, Alex, I can't believe you're siding with her.
F	ALEX	I'm not siding with anyone, but technically, he is no longer...
F	NATALIE	You know Charlie would NEVER approve of this.
F	ALEX	Oh come on, Charlie wouldn't care. I think you're just being overly cautious.
F	DYLAN	Uh, guys? GUYS!
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	I'm a big girl. I make my own decisions. I'm going out with him. Sweet dreams.
M	THE THIN MAN	So, now we have the transmitter, what do we do with fat boy? Dirt nap time?
M	VIVIAN WU	NO! Not until I've got the information I need. We'll take him to the compound, hold him there. In the meantime, we've got to tie up some loose ends.
M	THIN MAN	Whenever you say something like that, it means more work for me.
M	VIVIAN WU	The Angels will figure out they were duped. We can't afford them jeopardizing our plans.
M	THE THIN MAN	Here it comes...
M	VIVIAN WU	We have to Kill Charlie's Angels.
M	THE THIN MAN	Guess I'll cancel my weekend plans.
M	JASON	Alex, I can't tell you how happy I am you came.
F	ALEX	Me too.
M	JASON	No, I mean, it's weird. It's weirding me out how happy I am when you're around. Am I sick or something?
F	ALEX	Got me.
M	JASON	The only bummer is, I start to jones when you're not around. What the hell am I gonna do this weekend, if you're not with me?
F	ALEX	We'll get you some sedatives. You'll be fine.
M	JASON	Hey. Wait a second. Come with me!
F	ALEX	Come with you?
M	JASON	Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got two tickets to the Final Four.
F	ALEX	Jason, I don't...
M	JASON	Wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? I'm sick of how little we see each other. I'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there.
F	ALEX	It's my job, Jason. I can't explain it, but I have to be on call, all the time, and...
M	JASON	What if I changed all that? What if I told you to quit your job, and come live with me. What I'm saying, Alex, is that I want you to...
F	ALEX	Gunfire! Get down!
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	My God, you're hit. You're...
M	JASON	Fine. I'm fine. They're squibs, it's fake. See?
M	JASON (CONT'D)	Fake guns, too. They're just setting up for the next scene.
F	ALEX	Sorry about that, I...
M	JASON	God, I loved that. The way you yelled and everything? Baby, you been watching too many movies. Alright, I gotta go reset these. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to finish this conversation.
F	ALEX	Nice, Alex. Real nice.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Hey, is someone firing more squibs or...
M	JASON	Alex? ALEX?
F	NATALIE	Thanks for the second chance. I swear, I'm really not a flake.
M	PETE	How can I deny any woman who's seen all 23 "Lords of Wind and Power"?
F	NATALIE	I bet there's a dozen women here who fit that description.
M	PETE	Honestly -- there's a looks component as well. NATALIE Really.
M	PETE	You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen this close up.
F	NATALIE	Ladies room. I'll be back in two minutes.
M	PETE	I'll be here.
F	NATALIE	Who do you work for?
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Speak now or never again.
M	THE MAN	Jacket pocket.
F	NATALIE	National Security Agency? You're with the NSA?
M	THE MAN	I've been following you. I didn't know which side you were on. This is bigger than you think.
F	NATALIE	I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I can't explain. This is my cell phone number. Please call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry.
F	DYLAN	Where's that music coming from?
M	KNOX	You'll see. Just a little farther.
F	DYLAN	Oh... Oh wow.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	That's amazing.
M	KNOX	Can I ask you a personal question?
F	DYLAN	Maybe.
M	KNOX	How much do you know about Charlie?
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	I just find it strange that you work for a man you've never met.
F	DYLAN	Well, I don't know what he looks like, but I feel like I know him. We all do.
M	KNOX	And none of you have any clue who he actually is?
F	DYLAN	Nope.
M	KNOX	And you're never curious to find out?
F	DYLAN	Of course, but believe me, it's impossible. I've tried. Let's not talk about Charlie, okay? Or work.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	In fact, let's not talk at all.
F	DYLAN	Eric, it's Vivian.
M	KNOX	Hmmm. I wonder what she's here for?
F	DYLAN	Want me to tell her to come back, or...
M	KNOX	No, no. I'd better deal. You go back to bed.
F	DYLAN	Hello?
F	NATALIE	Dylan, we were set up. Vivian Wu is not who she says she is. She's a former assassin and an all around bitch.
F	DYLAN	Oh no. OH SHIT. Natalie, she's HERE!
F	NATALIE	What?!
F	DYLAN	I'm at Knox's, she just showed up!
F	NATALIE	I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I get there.
F	DYLAN	I can't do that. Call Alex and meet me here.
F	NATALIE	Dylan...
M	VIVIAN WU	I see you take your bodyguarding services seriously. Still, I worry that no one is watching the door.
F	DYLAN	Oh, I'm watching it. In fact, I just called for back up.
M	VIVIAN WU	All the same, I'm concerned about Mr. Knox's safety.
M	KNOX	Vivian just came over to run through some numbers for the IPO.
M	VIVIAN WU	Please, take a seat. I'm almost finished.
M	VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)	Really. How disappointing.
F	DYLAN	I'm not much for games.
M	VIVIAN WU	Pity.
M	VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)	Bad news: The other angels are still alive. Good news: Everything else proceeding apace.
M	KNOX	Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment would come sooner or later. I was just hoping for later.
F	DYLAN	All this time, we thought Red Star was behind this, but it was you. You faked your kidnapping.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Why?
M	KNOX	To gain your trust. And get your help. I want you to know, my personal attraction to you was a sincere and unrelated complication.
F	DYLAN	Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot better about you being a lying pole smoker.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	I can't believe I trusted you.
M	KNOX	Why not? You trust Charlie and you've never even met him. And believe me, there's a lot about him that you don't know. Anyway, I'm not going to be an idiot and stand here talking when we could do something useful, like KILL YOU. Goodbye, Dylan, I'll miss you...
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	Wow. I've never seen YOU do something like that.
M	VIVIAN WU	Oh, shut up.
M	VIVIAN WU	She can't have survived. It's too far.
M	VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)	Still, I should probably check...
M	KNOX	We've got more important things to do. WIPE TO:
F	DYLAN	I can't believe Knox tried to kill me. I mean, I've been lied to, I've been cheated on, but no guy has ever tried to SHOOT me before. I'm gonna get him for that.
F	ALEX	He played us from the very start. It was all just so he could get us to tap into Red Star. He couldn't figure out a way to do it himself.
F	NATALIE	Who knew that we are actually tapping into the main servers for The National Security Agency?
F	DYLAN	And now, thanks to us, he's had hours to download whatever top secret information he wants, for God knows what reason. NATALIE Wait a minute. We installed the transmitter, yes, but we never gave him the receiver.
F	ALEX	What?
F	NATALIE	That laptop was the only way to access the transmitter. And we gave the laptop to...
M	ANGELS	Bosley! cell, as such, is a round room.
F	ALEX	Come on, Bosley, answer. I've tried all his numbers and paged him five times. No answer.
F	NATALIE	I don't even want to think about what I'm thinking right now.
F	DYLAN	Don't! He's alive, he's gotta be. If... What IS that?
M	BOSLEY (O.S.)	Angels! Angels, can you hear me!
M	BOSLEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)	I don't know if you can hear me. I don't know if this thing is even working.
M	BOSLEY	I know you can't answer, but... I really hope you can hear this.
F	DYLAN	Can we trace him?
F	NATALIE	Not off a boosted signal. We'd have to be within 20 miles.
F	ALEX	Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are.
M	BOSLEY	I don't know where I am, really. I'm in a round room. The walls are white. Well. Not white-white. More of a cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes, I'm going to say vanilla. I can see the ocean.
F	ALEX	Bingo.
M	BOSLEY	I don't know which ocean. I was blindfolded the whole time. We were flying. It must've been three or four hours. Maybe more.
F	DYLAN	He could be anywhere in North America.
M	BOSLEY	Wherever it is, they have really good pudding.
F	DYLAN	What, pudding?
F	NATALIE	Hear that? That's a blue spotted egret. They only live in one place.
F	ALEX	Florida.
M	KNOX	Well?
M	THIN MAN	Our access was cut off at the source.
M	KNOX	GODDAMNIT!
M	THIN MAN	But not before we retrieved the information you wanted.
M	THIN MAN (CONT'D)	The National Security Agency's secret file on the man known as Charles Townsend.
M	KNOX	Finally. How about Bosley? Did we get the information we wanted?
M	THIN MAN	Once we we drugged him, he sang like a bird.
M	KNOX	Hmmm. Miami Arena. Preparations have been made?
M	THIN MAN	Yes. We move out tonight.
M	KNOX	Excellent. Where IS Bosley?
M	THIN MAN	In the tower. We were waiting till you gave the word.
M	KNOX	Well? No time like the present.
M	HENCHMAN	Sir? You should take a look at this. See here? Look at the timer on the camera.
M	THIN MAN	It's not moving. Oh, this is the oldest one in the book. Punch up camera three.
M	THIN MAN (CONT'D)	Now pan left.
M	THIN MAN (CONT'D)	The old re-loop the video camera trick. And look, she's not even carrying a gun. What is this, amateur hour?
M	THIN MAN (O.S.)	Um, excuse me? I think you're trespassing.
M	THIN MAN (CONT'D)	No offense, but as "storming the castle" plans go, this one sucked.
F	DYLAN	Oh yeah? And I suppose you could do better?
M	THIN MAN	Yeah, I sure as hell could.
F	DYLAN	Oh, right.
M	THIN MAN	How about an underwater entry? Or hang gliding over the main tower? There's a million good ways in, if you just do your homework.
F	ALEX	You heard the man.
F	NATALIE	Nice work, Dyl.
M	THIN MAN	Present for you, sir.
M	KNOX	Dylan, how nice. Welcome to my Florida home. Not as tasteful as the one in LA, but much more private.
F	DYLAN	So tell me, Knox, what's the brilliant plan? You gonna sell a list of our foreign spies to the highest bidder? Blackmail the President?
M	KNOX	The first plan is too complicated, and the second is virtually impossible.
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	Besides, I already have all the money I need and my motivation is much simpler... ... revenge.
F	DYLAN	Revenge? Against who?
M	KNOX	You know what? I'm not in a gabby mood right now. I've got a score to settle.
F	DYLAN	Seems like you're going a bit overboard.
M	KNOX	No, just leaving myself plenty of margin for error. Goodbye, Dylan.
F	DYLAN	I don't know why you bother. I've already won.
M	THIN MAN	Is that so?
F	DYLAN	Every moment I sit here is a moment I'm using to figure out how to take you down. In fact, this statement -- this one I'm making right here-- is just me stalling for time while I decide which of your goons I'm going to flatten first. It's gonna be the guy behind me.
M	THE THIN MAN	Really?
F	DYLAN	By the time your guys are firing, I'll be at about 180 on my reverse inverted 360, which will land me on Fat Boy there, as promised. He'll take the chair seat in the chin. Now... I'm warning both of you: I'm going to get you to shoot each other. I know. Cliche as that sounds. Last, you guys -- hell, I'll make something up. We'll have fun.
M	THE THIN MAN	And what will you do to me?
F	DYLAN	You won't even be here. I mean, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you should've killed me by now. Because I already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal --
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Ah! See?
M	HENCHMAN AT THE DOOR	We have intruders.
F	NATALIE	Bosley's close.
F	ALEX	You find him. I'll get Dylan.
F	NATALIE	BOSLEY! Bosley, can you hear me?
M	BOSLEY	Natalie! Is that you?
F	NATALIE	How do I get up to you?
M	BOSLEY	There's a staircase. Look for a switch.
F	NATALIE	Hello?... Pete, hi! How are you?
M	PETE	I'm good. I just -- you said you wanted me to call.
F	NATALIE	I did. I do. I mean, thank you for calling.
M	PETE	I'm not an insecure person or anything, and I've really enjoyed the very brief time we have spent together.
M	PETE (CONT'D)	I'm just wondering if it's something I said or did that's making this whole thing so weird between us.
F	NATALIE	Can you hold on a sec?
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	One more sec.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Sorry about that. PETE Listen, is this a bad time?
F	NATALIE	No. Not at all.
M	PETE	You just sound distracted.
F	NATALIE	You know, work this week has been really busy. It's been hard to focus.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	See, the thing is, I'm not a full- time waitress. I should have been more up-front about that, it's just...
M	PETE	Natalie, what was that?
F	NATALIE	Everything's fine!
M	VIVIAN WU	Hate to disagree.
M	VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)	Is this the famous Charlie?
M	PETE	No, it's Pete.
F	NATALIE	You bitch! I like that guy.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?
M	VIVIAN WU	To be honest? I don't care.
F	NATALIE	I can handle villainy. I can even handle super-villainy. But what you did is just wrong.
M	NATALIE (CONT'D)	Hi, Bos!
F	DYLAN	Here we go.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Okay, that part worked.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Now, guys, I warned you. This is where you shoot each other.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Okay, here's where we improvise.
M	BOSLEY	Oh my God, let me help you.
M	KNOX	Let's GO!
M	DYLAN (O.S.)	Damn!
F	NATALIE	Don't worry, we'll get him.
F	DYLAN	You don't understand. He's got a pound of C-5 in that briefcase.
F	ALEX	The question is, where's he headed?
M	BOSLEY (O.S.)	Miami. The man Knox is trying to kill has two general admission tickets to the Duke- Maryland game at Miami Arena. He's going to blow up the arena and kill his target.
F	DYLAN	Not that I don't believe you, but how exactly do you know all this?
M	BOSLEY	Because Angels, I was the one who purchased those tickets.
F	NATALIE	But Bosley, you HATE sports, why would you... You didn't buy them for yourself.
F	ALEX	You bought them for...
M	ANGELS	CHARLIE!
F	DYLAN	What do you think he looks like?
F	ALEX	Sixty, tall, well-built.
F	NATALIE	I always saw him as younger.
F	DYLAN	Definitely. With black hair.
F	NATALIE	No, silver hair. And tan.
F	ALEX	He's not George Hamilton.
F	NATALIE	He's outside a lot.
F	DYLAN	We'll know him when we see him, that's for sure.
F	ALEX	IF we see him.
F	NATALIE	How hard can it be to spot Charlie?
F	DYLAN	Aw, shit. We have to split up!
F	ALEX	I'll take the luxury boxes.
F	DYLAN	I'll take the mezzanine.
F	NATALIE	I got the floor.
M	JASON	Yes, yes!
F	ALEX	Charlie!? Charles Townsend!
M	JASON	Alex?
F	ALEX	Jason? Shit.
M	JASON	ALEX! Hey...
F	DYLAN	Charlie! Charlie!
F	NATALIE	Charlie?
M	LIKELY CANDIDATE	Who?
F	ALEX	Charles Townsend? Anybody, Charles Townsend?
M	THIN MAN (O.S.)	Don't move.
M	THIN MAN (CONT'D)	You move, you say anything, I perforate you. Got it? Alex?! Jesus, what is going on?
F	ALEX	Jason, hi, I... Can I talk to you later?
M	JASON	No you can talk to me NOW. I want to know what the hell is going on. First, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye.
F	ALEX	I'm sorry, I...
M	JASON	Now, I see you here, but you're with some other guy.
M	THIN MAN	Hey, movie star, do yourself a favor and get lost.
M	JASON	Lemme guess. You must be Charlie?
F	ALEX	Jason, please...
M	JASON	No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and can't do.
M	THIN MAN	That was stupid.
F	ALEX	Jason, get down!
M	JASON	What the hell is going on?
F	ALEX	Right now, just by leaning forward, I could crush your windpipe. You'd die a slow and painful death. You don't want that, do you?
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Where is the bomb, when's it going off?
F	ALEX	Hi, Jason. Gimme one second?
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	Angels! Knox planted the bomb in the basement, and it's timed to go off when the game clock hits zero!
M	NATALIE (O.S.)	Roger that, Alex, I'll stop the clock!
M	DYLAN (O.S.)	I'll look for the bomb!
F	ALEX	I lied to you Jason. I'm not a secretary.
M	JASON	Yeah, I can see that.
F	ALEX	And that wasn't Charlie.
M	JASON	Right.
F	ALEX	I'm actually here to stop a madman from killing everyone in this building. Would it be okay if we talked later?
M	JASON	Go save the world, honey. I'll be waiting for you.
M	REFEREE	Time out!
F	DYLAN	Alright, Dylan, all we have to do is figure out which wire to cut.
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	Oh, shit.
F	ALEX	You're kidding me.
M	COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER	The time out is over, but one cheerleader doesn't seem to notice. Officials can't start the clock again while she's on the court.
F	DYLAN	Chartreuse and magenta. This has gotta be it.
M	KNOX (O.S.)	I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	See, if you snip ANY of those wires, the bomb WILL blow up.
F	DYLAN	It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero.
M	KNOX	Who told you that, my idiotic henchman? Do you think I tell him ANYTHING that's confidential?
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	THIS is what triggers that bomb. So if you'll kindly step away, I'll refrain from killing both of us. she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away.
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	In different circumstances, Dylan, I think you and I could have worked out. We have a lot in common.
F	DYLAN	Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you ARE one.
M	KNOX	Good one. Well, I must be going. If you like your body parts attached to your torso, I suggest you do the same.
F	ALEX	Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded.
F	NATALIE	Give us the detonator.
M	KNOX	NO!
M	KNOX (CONT'D)	I'll blow this building sky high, I swear!
M	CHARLIE (O.S.)	Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want, not all these innocent people.
M	KNOX	Charlie?
M	ANGELS	Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	Your father was a double agent, Eric. Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail. He was my friend.
M	KNOX	It's still your fault, you arrogant prick! You still killed my father!
M	CHARLIE	Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should YOU kill all these people? If you hate me so much, just shoot ME. Just shoot me, Eric.
M	KNOX	Okay. You're right. I'll just kill you.
F	DYLAN	Charlie, no. NO!
M	DYLAN (CONT'D)	He's trying to say something.
M	VOICE	Ucch, that tasted terrible!
F	NATALIE	Bosley! Are you okay?
M	BOSLEY	Think so.
M	BOSLEY (CONT'D)	Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.
F	DYLAN	Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's here... then where's Charlie?
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Great work, angels. You'll be happy to know you received another presidential commendation.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Enjoy your vacation, angels.
M	THE ANGELS	Thank you Charlie.
M	CHARLIE'S VOICE	Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been putting in some long hours on this case, so I thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends.
F	DYLAN	Any chance you'll be joining us, Charlie?
M	CHARLIE	I'd love to, Angels. But I have some precious treasures to watch over.
F	DYLAN	To Charlie.
M	THE ANGELS AND BOSLEY	To Charlie.
