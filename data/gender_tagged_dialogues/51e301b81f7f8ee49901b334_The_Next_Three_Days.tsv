M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	LARA	You know what? If you were smart you would stop talking right now.
M	ERIT	Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women.
F	LARA	How can you say that??
M	ERIT	They're always threatened. Especially if you're beautiful and they're not.
F	LARA	Erit, you are so full of shit.
M	ERIT	So, your boss isn't threatened by you?
F	LARA	Because she's a bitch! -- --Not because she's a woman.
M	ERIT	And you would describe her as "attractive"?
F	LARA	That has nothing to do with it!
M	ERIT	And there is my answer.
M	JOHN	Either of you like another drink?
M	ERIT	Women should work under men, men under women. That's it.
M	JOHN	But men under men?
M	ERIT	That's fine, too. They're used to it! Why are you laughing?
M	MICK	I don't know, bro, but I think I'd rather work under you than her.
M	ERIT	Oh please, I'd rather work under him, too.
F	LARA	You'd rather "work under" John?
M	ERIT	You have a problem with that, too?
F	LARA	No, why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?
M	ERIT	What is up your ass tonight??
F	LARA	So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.
M	ERIT	Lara, if I wanted your husband I would have him.
F	LARA	How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.
M	ERIT	-- You know what your problem is?!
M	JOHN MICK	That was a great meal! Okay--okay!
M	JOHN	She is completely full of shit.
F	LARA	DON'T try and agree with me now.
M	JOHN	You know what? I don't even believe she is in the dental profession.
F	LARA	Shut up.
M	JOHN	I bet she can't even spell anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete fraud.
F	LARA	We went to her office party, idiot.
M	JOHN	I think she hit on me that night, too.
F	LARA	You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her.
M	JOHN	I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.
F	LARA	You are such an asshole.
M	JOHN	You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your--
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Someone's going to -- WHITE 9-10-09 5.
F	LARA	Hello!
M	LARA (CONT'D)	Did he cry?
F	JENNA	Only when I dropped him down the stairs.
M	JOHN	Thanks. See you next weekend.
M	JOHN	Okay, your turn. Very good, very good...
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	No, no, no; you feed me. Your son is hopeless.
F	LARA	Squeeze in tight.
M	JOHN	You can't do this every morning. It is way too corny.
F	LARA	Smile. It's just until he's eighteen.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	Present.
M	JOHN	Sweetie, you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue.
F	LARA	You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes them in thirty seconds.
M	JOHN	I love brushing my teeth. The lies your mother tells.
F	LARA	When's your last class?
M	JOHN	Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?
F	LARA	After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?
M	JOHN	Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.
F	LARA	Did you call your father?
M	JOHN	When?
F	LARA	"When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!
M	JOHN (O.S.)	I sent him flowers and a handmade card.
F	LARA	You're completely impossible. Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? A grunt.
M	JOHN	Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up.
F	LARA	Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here?
M	JOHN	Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.
F	LARA	How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you?
M	JOHN	Now she's driving a wedge between us.
F	LARA	I give up.
M	JOHN	And now she is abandoning you.
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	Police. Mr. Brennan?
M	DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)	My name is Detective Quinn. This is a search warrant for these premises.
M	DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)	Stay where you are.
M	JOHN	Get your --
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	Touch me again and you'll be arrested.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	Lara Brennan?
F	LARA	WHAT?!
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	Lara Brennan, you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.
F	LARA	She's dead?? Elizabeth is dead??
M	JOHN	She didn't do anything!
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	I will only --
M	JOHN	She didn't do anything!
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	Put him in cuffs. Daddy!... DADDY!! It's okay. Just a bad dream.
M	JOHN	You okay?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Okay, you can sleep here as long as you stay on this side of the bed.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	You're such a snake, I don't know why I keep falling for the same trick.
M	JOHN (O.S.)	But Sam's your friend, right?
M	LUKE	Not at lunch.
M	JOHN	Does he take your food?
M	LUKE	No.
M	JOHN	Did he say something mean? About Mommy?
M	LUKE	Yeah.
M	JOHN	Did you hit him?
M	LUKE	Yeah.
M	JOHN	Good. Where did you hit him?
M	LUKE	Near the swings.
M	JOHN	Wow. I bet that hurt.
M	LUKE	Yeah.
M	JOHN	It's a toy!
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Don't worry. We'll get it back.
F	LARA	Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss? Come on, give Mommy a kiss.
M	JOHN	Rat-Bag. Give Mommy a kiss.
F	LARA	Is Daddy reading you my letters?
M	JOHN	Every night at bedtime.
F	LARA	What are you building? A fort?
M	LARA (CONT'D)	Was he scared going to school?
M	JOHN	I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave.
F	LARA	What did you make him for lunch?
M	JOHN	Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no "vegetables" on it. He swore he ate his apple.
F	LARA	Look at his friends. And his desk. This is his teacher?
M	JOHN	Miss Phillips.
F	LARA	You may have to move to another school district.
M	JOHN	Already spoke to a realtor.
F	LARA	How was your first day?
M	JOHN	Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom.
F	LARA	When is she coming?
M	JOHN	She's having a lot of trouble with her business.
F	LARA	It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it. Have you heard anything?
M	JOHN	About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say?
F	LARA	--Don't--
M	JOHN	-- It can take months for the court to rule.
F	LARA	I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared.
M	JOHN	Meyer's looking for a new investigator.
F	LARA	Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it.
M	JOHN	He'll go through all the evidence again.
F	LARA	Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet.
M	JOHN	We're doing fine.
F	LARA	You just lie and lie. But you are very handsome. Can you do me a favor?
M	JOHN	I don't know, I'm a little busy.
F	LARA	I need you to run for governor.
M	JOHN	-- Oh, that I can do.
F	LARA	You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	I'm okay. I'm okay.
M	JOHN	I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise.
F	LARA	You think he'll ever want to kiss me again?
M	JOHN	Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Good?
M	PAULA	How's Lara?
M	JOHN	She's doing okay.
M	PAULA	Tell her we're pulling for her.
M	JOHN	I will.
M	PAULA	They won't recycle these unless you take off the cap. This is trash. This is recyclable.
M	JOHN	Ok. Thanks.
M	JOHN	Luke! Let's go, Toad. Come on.
F	NICOLE	Time to go, Carrie!
M	MEYER	John, I said my office at four o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --
M	JOHN	I figured you had to eat.
M	MEYER	Do you have the ruling in Brennan?
M	JOHN	But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?
M	MEYER	The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore.
M	JOHN	It was a robbery! Someone stole her purse!
M	MEYER	And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really...sucks.
M	JOHN	So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court.
M	MEYER	John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.
M	JOHN	So, I need to find an indecent one?
M	MEYER	No, I'm going to file it. But I need you to do something for me.
M	JOHN	Anything.
M	MEYER	I need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife.
M	JOHN	I've seen the evidence, Meyer.
M	MEYER	I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it. He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon--
M	JOHN	We went out for dinner! How do you do that after you kill somebody? She would have to be a psychopath!
M	MEYER	-- And the fight in the office.
M	JOHN	Everyone fights with their boss!
M	MEYER	But this one ended up dead.
M	JOHN	So, you never believed she was innocent?
M	MEYER	How can you say that?
M	JOHN	So, what are you saying, Meyer?!
M	MEYER	That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that.
M	JOHN	I'll find someone to file the pleadings.
M	MEYER	John! Come on! For Christ's sake. JOHN!!
M	ERIT	I know you won't want to hear this...
M	MICK	-- Erit, go put somebody to sleep.
M	JOHN	Thanks.
M	MICK	Had to be done. I am really going to pay for that.
M	JOHN	Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R-
M	DUTY NURSE	She can't have visitors.
M	JOHN	That's ridiculous; I have to see her.
M	DUTY NURSE	I'm sorry.
M	DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)	You can't go down there!
M	DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)	You can't be in here!!
M	JOHN	Lara!
M	HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1	I got him!
M	JOHN	Lara!
M	DR. BECSEY	What's going on?!
M	JOHN	My wife attempted suicide.
M	HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE	Let's go. (hands doctor chart) She's not allowed visitors.
M	JOHN	I have to see her!
M	DR. BECSEY	Why isn't she in the ER?
M	HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE	I'm not asking. Now. She's a transfer from County
M	JOHN	Please. Two minutes.
M	DR. BECSEY	Two minutes. WHITE 9-10-09 23.
F	JENNA	I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending he's asleep.
M	JOHN	Don't worry about it.
F	JENNA	It's okay.
M	JOHN	I insist. I kept you out on a school night.
F	JENNA	I'm not in school anymore.
M	JOHN	And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love, Mommy. You gonna give them hugs from her? Should we write her back?
M	LUKE	...When is she coming home?
M	JOHN	Soon honey. Soon.
M	LUKE	Can I have a quarter?
M	JOHN	Can you have a quarter?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend those. They come from the cottage where Mommy and I used to take you when you were a baby.
M	LUKE	Then can I have them all?
M	JOHN	...Sure.
M	JOHN	So, what is it about? Julie?
F	JULIE	That belief in someone's virtue is more important than virtue itself?
M	JOHN	No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	It is about how rational thought destroys the soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in it.
M	JOHN	It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost.
M	DAMON	Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?
M	JOHN	You escaped from jail seven times.
M	TOUGH GUY	No smoking!!
M	DAMON	Yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life?
M	JOHN	Mind if I tape you?
M	DAMON	Go for it, it can't be used as evidence. What do you want to know?
M	JOHN	How you escaped when no one else could.
M	DAMON	Balls and a little luck. No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it.
M	JOHN	How do you do that?
M	DAMON	A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt.
M	DAMON (CONT'D)	That's when they will make mistakes. But when you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.
M	DAMON (O.S.)	You have to know where you are going to go and how you are going to get there. You have to know how they plan to catch you, where, and when.
M	JOHN (O.S.)	How the hell do you know that?
M	DAMON (O.S.)	You pay off someone who knows. And a lot depends on if the prison is in the country or the city.
M	JOHN	The city.
M	DAMON	Where are you from?
M	JOHN	...Pittsburgh.
M	DAMON	Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off.
M	DAMON (O.S.)	From the time they make the call, the police can have the center of the city sealed tight in fifteen minutes.
M	JOHN	How can they be so exact?
M	DAMON	After 9-11 Homeland Security made every city have a lock-down plan -- downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis -- fifteen minutes. They can do DC in under ten.
M	DAMON (O.S.)	Within thirty-five minutes they will have cops at every tollbooth on the interstate --
M	DAMON	And be running rolling stops on the secondary roads. They won't have your photograph yet, but they will have your description. What if you can't make it out?
M	JOHN	Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of time.
M	DAMON	Then surrender.
M	DAMON (CONT'D)	Because they will shoot you on sight, along with anyone you are with.
M	DAMON (O.S.)	Stay far away from the train and bus stations.
M	DAMON	Forget the local airports. Leave from another state.
M	DAMON	Second: identity. It's easy to find fake papers, harder to find ones that will get you through an airport.
M	DAMON (O.S.)	You'll need a passport, driver's license and a social security number.
M	DAMON	If you have to rent a car, find a place that will take a cash deposit. They'll still run a credit check, so use a real person's name on the ID. Third: destination. You want somewhere that doesn't attract American tourists and doesn't get American newspapers. Think Yemen and you get the idea.
M	DAMON	Then money. You need a truck load of it. Everything's expensive: hotels, travel, information.
M	JOHN	How much?
M	DAMON	Enough to last at least five-six years. Run out of money and you run out of friends.
M	DAMON	But before you do anything, you have to ask yourself if you can do it. Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door? Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become. And if you can't, don't start, because you'll just get someone killed. How did you get caught?
M	DAMON	I gave myself up. I couldn't take wondering when someone was going to come through the bedroom door. Got what you need?
M	JOHN	Yeah.
M	DAMON	What do you have in your pocket?
M	LUKE	It was already tied.
M	LUKE (CONT'D)	You untied it again!
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Mr. Brennan?
M	DR. LIFSON	We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.
M	JOHN	Oh, sorry. Hello, Doctor.
M	DR. LIFSON	I'll bring them back myself.
M	DR. LIFSON	We check your wife's blood regularly. She's been refusing her insulin. I don't want to sound dramatic, but it's just another form of suicide.
M	JOHN	I'll talk to her.
M	DR. LIFSON	If she doesn't --
M	JOHN	I'll talk to her. Let's go, Squirrel.
M	JOHN	Hey. Are you alright?
F	LARA	I'm fine. I'm fine.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?
M	JOHN	The doctor told me about the insulin.
F	LARA	Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.
M	JOHN	You forgot? For how many days?
F	LARA	I forgot, okay? I have things on my mind.
M	JOHN	--And so much to do.
F	LARA	Oh, that's nice.
M	JOHN	Why are you doing this?
F	LARA	Can I please just watch him play? Tell me about kindergarten. No. I need you to --
F	LARA	Fine, I won't forget again, okay? I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner...and I don't know how I can live knowing that. Okay?
M	JOHN	Lara. Look at me. Something will happen. I promise.
F	LARA	What? What is going to happen? There are no more appeals, there are no more anything. Exactly what miracle are we hoping for, John?
M	LARA (CONT'D)	I need you to do something for me.
M	JOHN	Sure.
F	LARA	Stop bringing him.
M	JOHN	Come on...
F	LARA	He hates coming here. Look at him.
M	JOHN	Lara....
F	LARA	Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	You want to hear something funny?
M	JOHN	Yes. Anything.
F	LARA	My mother tried to send me anti-aging cream.
F	EUGENIE	You're sure that you don't want a lawn sign?
M	JOHN	I'm very sure. Thanks.
M	COPTER PILOT	On the left, Allegheny County Jail. Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been three escape attempts. No one's made it out alive. On your right...
F	LYLA	On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there.
M	JOHN	Thanks.
M	JOHN	Adderall?
M	MOUSS	Ten apiece, five for forty.
M	JOHN	I need some passports.
M	MOUSS	Piss off.
M	MOUSS	You have to pay up front.
M	JOHN	I can do that.
M	MOUSS	You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?
M	JOHN	No.
M	MOUSS	Ask for Harv.
M	JOHN	What's your name?
M	MOUSS	Just say Mouss.
M	JOHN	Mouss said to come see you.
M	HARV	He did, did he? What do you want?
M	JOHN	Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number.
M	HARV	How do you know Mouss?
M	JOHN	He babysits my kid.
M	HARV	Okay.
M	HARV	You have the photos on you?
M	JOHN	Yes. How much?
M	HARV	Fifteen hundred. WHITE 9-10-09 40.
M	MOUSS	I ever see you again, you lose an eye.
F	EUGENIE	You did remember I was showing the house?
M	JOHN	Give me two minutes.
F	EUGENIE	It really is a great neighborhood.
F	GRACE	Oh, my lord! What happened?
M	JOHN	It was stupid, I fell off the bike.
F	GRACE	The bike that's been in our garage for two years? Put your head back.
M	JOHN	Some guy made a crack about Lara.
F	GRACE	So, that's what you do now: punch everyone who thinks she's guilty?
M	JOHN	What's that supposed to mean?
F	GRACE	It means it's important what YOU believe, not --
M	JOHN	Really? So, what do you believe, Mom?
F	GRACE	Why are you trying to start a fight?
M	JOHN	Come on, buddy! Where is his bag?
F	GRACE	Why are you doing this?!
M	JOHN	No reason. I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake.
F	GRACE	Stop this!
M	JOHN	Give Grandma a kiss.
M	LUKE	Does your face hurt?
M	JOHN	A little.
M	LUKE	Did you hit him back?
M	JOHN	No.
M	LUKE	That's okay.
M	JOHN	What?
M	MIKE	I was at the bar. I know what you are looking for.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	I'm deaf, you idiot. I read lips.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	You really want to talk out here?
M	MIKE	What do you need?
M	JOHN	Three passports, a driver's license and social security number that can take a credit check.
M	MIKE	Thirty seven hundred.
M	JOHN	That's too much.
M	MIKE	It is if you never get them. I need photos and a thousand in advance.
M	MIKE	I'll bring them Wednesday.
M	JOHN	Not here. Don't come here again.
M	MIKE	Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street. Under the bridge; two o'clock. If I'm not there on time, leave. oilcloth. John unwraps it and hands it back.
M	JOHN	Show me how to load it.
M	JOHN	No video game.
M	LUKE (O.S.)	Dad!
M	JOHN	I'll play checkers with you after dinner. You'll just lose again. John? It's Eugenie. You're not going to believe it; the people I brought over? They made an offer! I'll bring it in the morning.
M	JOHN	Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly destroy you.
M	KID ON SCREEN	-- a bump key. First, find any key that fits into the same make of lock.
M	NOTARY	Mr. Brennan?
M	NOTARY	And just put your thumb there.
M	NOTARY (CONT'D)	Thanks, that's all I need.
M	JOHN	I'll just be a moment.
F	LARA	Your poor face. How could you do that to yourself?
M	JOHN	I am useless without you. I can't even ride a bike.
F	LARA	I think it's very sexy.
M	JOHN	I'm sorry we had to do this.
F	LARA	You have nothing to apologize for. But you should have told me before this.
M	JOHN	I know.
F	LARA	I don't want you not telling me things.
M	JOHN	From now on I will.
F	LARA	I won't know where to picture you. I close my eyes and I see Luke in his bedroom, you on the sofa by the Window. I won't know where to picture you anymore.
M	PAULA (O.S.)	John?
M	JOHN	Hi.
M	PAULA	I was wondering if I could ask you to water my plants next week; I'm going in for an operation.
M	JOHN	I hope it's nothing serious.
M	PAULA	My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me. He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him. But I'll be fine. Thanks.
M	RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)	English Department, this is Catherine.
M	JOHN	Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class. I will let him know.
M	MICK (V.O.)	Are you ever going to answer your goddamn phone?
M	MIKE	You were supposed to leave.
M	JOHN	I need them.
M	MIKE	You notice that guy was a cop?
M	JOHN	Which guy?
M	MIKE	The one with the red light in his back window.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	Just give me the money.
M	MIKE (CONT'D)	You want this too much. You're going to fuck it up.
M	JOHN	How are you doing today?
M	GUARD	Don't touch that.
M	JOHN	Sorry. WHITE 9-10-09 51.
M	MAJOR	So, you are where in here?
M	JOHN	...In the middle there.
M	MAJOR	In the middle. Can you point to yourself?
M	JOHN	It's hard to tell. I think that's me there. Why?
M	MAJOR	So that's not you there. By the elevator?
M	JOHN	....No. I was over here. You want to tell me what's going on?
M	MAJOR	You want me to tell you?
M	JOHN	Yes.
M	MAJOR	You know what a bump key is?
M	JOHN	Sorry.
M	MAJOR	If this was you, you might want to think about what's going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	-- The worst date you've ever been on? This was worse. And this guy? He really thinks he is doing great. Then he's driving me home and I know he's going to try and kiss me, so I pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm actually snoring, right in his car. Does that stop him?
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)	...What?
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	Did I tell you not to date cops?
M	MICK (O.S.)	Let me in, asshole!! Open up! Your car is in the garage, I know you're in there!
M	MALE NEIGHBOR	What's your problem? He's not home!
M	MICK	Not home? So you're saying I'm blind?
M	MALE NEIGHBOR	No, I'm saying you're an idiot.
M	MICK	You know what? You're right. I am an idiot.
M	LUKE (O.S.)	...Dad?
M	LUKE	Can I have my cookies?
M	JOHN	You hungry? You want your sandwich?
M	LUKE	No.
F	NICOLE	Carrie! I'm sorry. She just already has it all figured out. Nicole.
M	JOHN	I remember.
F	NICOLE	Really?
M	JOHN	I remember your daughter.
F	NICOLE	She's hard to forget. Oh, this is for you. Luke was supposed to bring it home.
M	JOHN	He has his father's memory.
F	NICOLE	It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please come; I'd love to meet your wife.
M	JOHN	I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated.
F	NICOLE	I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on, time for lunch. We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us?
M	JOHN	Oh, we're pretty...you know....
F	NICOLE	Busy?
M	NICOLE (CONT'D)	Come on, we owe you for the cookies.
M	JOHN	That's true. And I made those cookies.
F	NICOLE	And learned how to pre-package them.
M	JOHN	Which requires a considerable amount of machinery. Come on, Luke.
F	NICOLE	Do you trade off time with Luke?
M	JOHN	No. Luke and I are together full time.
F	NICOLE	Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.
M	JOHN	She'd like nothing better than to be here. With him. Lara. She really misses...all this.
F	NICOLE	I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?
M	JOHN	No. She's not like that. She'd... She's in prison.
F	NICOLE	Oh.
M	JOHN	I don't tell most people.
F	NICOLE	I understand.
M	JOHN	She's innocent. She didn't kill the woman.
F	NICOLE	...Good. I mean, I'm sure she didn't.
M	JOHN	We should really be getting home.
F	NICOLE	Oh, okay.
M	JOHN	Thanks for the invitation. We'll try and make it.
F	NICOLE	That would be great.
M	JOHN	You want to read a letter from Mom?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As Much As Chocolate...
M	LUKE	She didn't write that.
M	JOHN	My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out.
M	LUKE	But what's wrong with her?
M	JOHN	She's not feeling well.
M	LUKE	Why didn't she just stay home?
M	JOHN	Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed.
M	LUKE	How do you know when you're that sick?
M	JOHN	The doctors do tests.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Come on. WHITE 9-10-09 59.
M	JOHN	You okay?
M	JOHN	Luke! Time for bed.
M	JOHN	...What's wrong?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	What is it?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	No....NO! They can't move you. Not without notice! Monday isn't notice!
F	LARA	I was only here through the appeal. We knew I'd be moved to a prison.
M	JOHN	Muncy is the other side of the state.
M	JOHN	I don't have two weeks! I need it tomorrow!
F	EUGENIE	The title hasn't been cleared -- there is no way that --
M	JOHN	How much can they give me?!
F	EUGENIE	Nothing!
F	ELAINE	What are you doing?! You almost killed us!
M	JOHN	Are you --?
F	ELAINE	Are you out of your mind?! You don't look?!
M	JOHN	I am so sorry --
F	ELAINE	Get away! Get away from us!
M	MEYER (O.S.)	I'm sorry.
M	JOHN	No, it was a long shot. Thanks.
M	MEYER	How's Lara?
M	JOHN	She's okay. Thanks, Meyer.
F	LARA	What's wrong?
M	JOHN	Nothing.
F	LARA	Is it Luke?
M	JOHN	No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I told him traveling that distance would be a hardship on us, that Luke was already having trouble at school. Which is true. I haven't been spending enough time with him.
F	LARA	You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do.
M	JOHN	That's nice, that the two of you talk. What world do I live in, Lara?
F	LARA	I don't know, but it's not the real one. I am in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that -- !
M	FEMALE GUARD	We good here?
M	JOHN	Yes. Sorry.
F	LARA	Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better?
M	JOHN	Got it. I'm sorry.
F	LARA	And now you're apologizing. You really are a gem.
M	JOHN	What do you want from me?
F	LARA	Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her.
M	JOHN	Because I knew you didn't.
F	LARA	Then you'd be wrong.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I'm actually very sorry.
M	GUARD #2	Sir, you cannot stand there. SIR, you need to exit the building NOW.
M	JOHN	Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will. I know who you are.
M	JOHN	Thank you.
M	JOHN	You think?
M	LUKE	Girls love them.
M	JOHN	Hi Mom.
F	GRACE	What are you doing here?
M	JOHN	I've got class.
F	GRACE	Five o'clock at night?
M	JOHN	Yes. Bye. WHITE 9-10-09 68.
M	JOHN	Back up! Get back!
M	ALEX	-- Shoot them both!
M	JOHN	-- I'll shoot the dog!
M	ALEX	-- Shoot the dog!
M	THUG	-- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!
M	ALEX	-- You want the police here, asshole?!
M	JOHN	-- Good idea!
M	ALEX	-- Put the gun down!
M	JOHN	-- Call the dog off!! Put it away!
M	ALEX	-- Release!
M	JOHN	-- Put it away!! PUT IT AWAY!!
M	ALEX	In! Get in!
M	JOHN	You, too!
M	THUG	I'm not getting in there!
M	ALEX	Get in!
M	JOHN	-- Give me that chair!
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Move!
M	ALEX	You're dead.
M	DAVID	I didn't do anything!!
M	ALEX	You brought him!
M	DAVID	I didn't bring him!
M	JOHN	Shut up!
M	JOHN	On your knees! Hands behind your head!
M	DAVID	I can't kneel!
M	JOHN	On the floor!
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Where's the rest?
M	DAVID	That's twelve hundred dollars! Here, take it.
M	JOHN	Where do you keep your money?!
M	ALEX	Yeah, I'm going to give you my money.
M	JOHN	I'll shoot you!
M	ALEX	You won't even shoot a dog.
M	JOHN	Tell me!
M	ALEX	Shoot the floor again, impress me.
M	JOHN	I'm going to kill you both.
M	ALEX	No, I'm going to kill you both.
M	DAVID	Give him your money!
M	ALEX	Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.
M	DAVID	Stop it!!
M	ALEX	See? You aren't going to kill me. That was the worst you can do. So, now you've done it. Go home. I'll come find you and kill you.
M	ALEX (CONT'D)	You're wasting some good shit.
M	JOHN	Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.
M	THUG (O.S.)	What's going on?! Let me out!
M	ALEX	You going to burn me out?
M	JOHN	Yeah. That's what I'm going to do.
M	DAVID	Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
M	JOHN	Your money.
M	ALEX	This is a meth lab, you idiot!
M	JOHN	No. It was.
M	ALEX	My kid is upstairs!! -- What??
M	ALEX	MY KID!!
M	DAVID	Let me go!!
M	JOHN	Get up there!!
M	DAVID	The house is going to explode!
M	JOHN	Is anyone up here?!
M	DAVID	Don't leave me. I don't want to burn. Don't let me burn.
M	DAVID	I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
M	LT. NABULSI	Get out of my way.
M	LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)	What do we have?
M	SGT. HARRIS	A miracle. Meth lab in the basement, the house still standing. Should be just a crater.
M	LT. NABULSI	Do we know him?
M	SGT. HARRIS	Alex Gaidar, history of violence and drug trafficking.
M	LT. NABULSI	He have a kid?
M	SGT. HARRIS	Neighbor said wife left with him last year. Big surprise there.
M	LT. NABULSI	They type all this blood yet?
M	SGT. HARRIS	No, but someone left through the back door bleeding. Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.
M	JOHN	Hi. What are you doing up?
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I've come to get Luke.
M	GEORGE	John? Are you alright?
M	JOHN	I'm fine.
M	JOHN	Hey. Hey, buddy.
M	JOHN	What do you say?
M	LUKE	Thank you.
M	JOHN	Give Grandma a big kiss.
M	LUKE	I'm too tired to kiss.
M	JOHN	Luke...
F	GRACE	I'll get lots of kisses next weekend. We want to take him to the Harvest Festival in Kutztown, where they have the Clydesdales.
M	LUKE	Thank you, Grandma.
M	JOHN	Bye Mom.
M	GEORGE	Goodbye.
M	JOHN	Let's go.
M	SGT. HARRIS	Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase a black car down the alley, so that's probably his. We'll have the taillight debris at the lab by the time it opens.
M	LT. NABULSI	Before.
M	LUKE	Can I carry it?
M	JOHN	No. Just what fits in your bag.
M	LUKE	....What about my pockets? Or your pockets.
M	JOHN	Daddy will just be a minute.
M	SGT. HARRIS	Taillight matches any 2004-2009 Prius.
M	LT. NABULSI	What kind of a criminal drives a Prius?
M	SGT. HARRIS	A socially responsible one? Over a thousand of them registered in the city, seven thousand in the state.
M	LT. NABULSI	How many registered to felons?
M	SGT. HARRIS	Six in the state. Four of them to embezzlers or white collar criminals, one to a rapist, one to a murderer.
M	LT. NABULSI	Guess we start with the murderer.
M	SGT. HARRIS	She's in prison for life. The rapist is out.
M	LT. NABULSI	Find him.
M	NICOLE (O.S.)	Hello?
M	JOHN	...Hi.
F	NICOLE	Thanks. Good to see you.
M	LUKE	It's a pony.
F	NICOLE	Those aren't easy to wrap. You know the party is at eleven, right?
M	JOHN	What time is it? Nine. Oh, I'm so sorry, I should have looked more carefully.
F	NICOLE	It's no problem. Why don't you go give this to Carrie?
M	NICOLE (CONT'D)	Well, I guess you can help.
M	JOHN	Oh. Actually, I can't stay. I have to run some errands.
F	NICOLE	We'll see you later then.
M	JOHN	Thanks so much. If.... He...He has my parents' phone number in his pocket. In case I'm late.
F	NICOLE	No problem.
M	SGT. HARRIS	Rapist is in a wheelchair. Not sure if that was karma or --
M	LT. NABULSI	The murderer. Where is she incarcerated?
M	SGT. HARRIS	County; right here in town.
M	LT. NABULSI	She have a husband or kid old enough to drive?

M	SGT. HARRIS	Husband. School teacher.
M	LT. NABULSI	You got a home address?
M	SGT. HARRIS	No car in the garage. You want to get a warrant?
M	LT. NABULSI	Yeah.
M	LT. NABULSI	Get the warrant.
M	SGT. HARRIS	She's being transferred to University Hospital.
M	LT. NABULSI	Right now?
M	SGT. HARRIS	Right now.
M	LT. NABULSI	...Have them call the escort vehicle. Tell them we'll meet them at the hospital in less than ten.
M	JAIL GUARD #1	We have Lara Brennan. Put her in 7725 and start an IV.
M	DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)	Can you please page Dr. Becsey?
M	JAIL GUARD #1	Yeah?... We're here: prisoner's secure, no problems.... Will do.
M	JOHN	Put the phone down.
M	NURSE	Oh please, no.
F	LARA	John??
M	JOHN	Remove your holsters, put them on the floor and get on your knees.
F	LARA	What are you doing here?
M	JOHN	DO IT NOW!!
M	DISPATCHER (V.O.)	Lieutenant, the prisoner is secure; jail personnel are 10-27, Code 4. A squad car will meet you at the entrance.
M	SGT. HARRIS	She just said --
M	LT. NABULSI	Run the light.
M	JOHN	Tape their hands and feet. Do it!!
F	LARA	You have to stop this.
M	JAIL GUARD #1	You walk out that door with him and you will both be killed.
M	JOHN	Tape their mouths!
F	LARA	No. Stop.
M	JOHN	Put it on.
F	LARA	WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!
M	JOHN	Because we have no other choice!! Put it on! Turn around.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	Lara, put the clothes on!
F	LARA	No. NOW!!
F	LARA	No!
M	JOHN	Okay. Tell your son you aren't coming.
F	LARA	...Where is he?
M	JOHN	Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't coming.
F	LARA	How can you do this to me?
M	JOHN	Push send. Tell him I'm not coming back either.
F	LARA	John --
M	JOHN	Does it look like I'm going home?! Tell him he is alone now and his mother and father aren't coming back!
F	LARA	You son of a bitch.
M	DR. LIFSON	What are you doing? WHITE 9-10-09 91.
M	JOHN	Get out! Get out!
F	LARA	Where's Luke?! Is he safe? Where is he?!
M	JOHN	He's safe!
M	LT. NABULSI	What's wrong?
M	JOHN	Back away!
M	LT. NABULSI	Don't be stupid. Drop the weapon.
M	JOHN	Get back!
M	LT. NABULSI	We have units at every exit. You'll be shot trying to leave.

M	LT. NABULSI	Ring the city. Train and bus stations. Get their descriptions to the State Police. How old is their kid?
M	SGT. HARRIS	Six.
M	LT. NABULSI	Let's find out where he is.
F	LARA	Why didn't you tell me?
M	JOHN	You would've stopped me.
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	There's a case in there. Brush, moisturizer, makeup. Everything you had was old. I hope I got it right.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	You want to take a guess who just escaped from jail?
F	BRENDA	Hello.
M	JOHN	Hi. I'm here for my son.
F	BRENDA	Oh, they aren't back yet.
M	JOHN	Back from where?
F	BRENDA	The zoo.
M	JOHN	...The zoo?
F	BRENDA	It's a zoo party. They ate first. They should be back in about an hour. Would you like to wait?
M	JOHH	No. Thank you.
F	LARA	What's wrong?
M	LARA (CONT'D)	Where's Luke?
M	JOHN	He's at the party.
F	LARA	What party? You said the party was here.
M	JOHN	I was wrong. She took them to the zoo.
F	LARA	She?
M	GPS VOICE	Estimated drive time: seventeen minutes.

M	GPS VOICE	Time to destination: eleven minutes. grandparents after all.
F	LARA	You took the wrong turn! It's back there.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	The zoo is back there. You're going the wrong way! It's back there! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!
M	JOHN	She'll call my parents.
F	LARA	What??
M	JOHN	They'll take care of him, I will figure out how to get him to us.
F	LARA	Are you out of your mind!
M	JOHN	I tried!! There's no more time!! Any second now there's going to be a roadblock ahead! It might be there now!! If we don't get out now we don't get out!!
M	JOHN (CONT'D)	I promise. I promise I will find a way to get Luke to us. I will find some way. overstuffed trash bag.
M	JOHN	No, it really is fine. I can't thank you enough for taking care of him.
F	NICOLE	It is our pleasure. Wasn't it, Carrie?
F	LARA	Hi.
M	LUKE	Hi.
F	LARA	Did you have a nice time at the party?
M	LUKE	Yeah.
F	LARA	What was your favorite thing?
M	LUKE	Ice cream cake.
F	LARA	They had ice cream cake here?
M	LUKE	At Carrie's house.
F	LARA	Oh. What flavor?
M	LUKE	Lots of flavors.
F	LARA	My favorite.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	I'm going to sit back here, okay?
M	JOHN	Sure.
M	LUKE	I think we're going to the cottage.
F	LARA	Really?
M	LUKE	I have money.
F	LARA	Good. Then I'll stick close to you.
M	LUKE	Okay.
M	NEWS RADIO	-- Traffic down to two lanes at the tollbooths. And downtown is worse. Stay away from the train station if you are trying to get anywhere. Not sure what is happening but a KPGH caller says trains aren't moving and commuters are getting irate.
F	LARA	John? What are we going to do?
M	JOHN	We're going to the train station.
M	SGT. HARRIS	Hi.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	Hi.
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	You're not going to nod off, are you?
M	JOHN	Stay in the car.
M	LT. NABULSI	I understand....I understand. I didn't tell them to stop EVERY vehicle. Just the ones with a couple and a young child.
M	ELDERLY MAN	Are you sure twenty dollars is enough? Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that.
M	JOHN	This thing is very good on gas.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	Every one in the state.
M	LT. NABULSI	Go wider. Send their photos to every train, bus station and airport in a three hundred mile radius.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	So, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana?
M	LT. NABULSI	You know what direction they are going, smart ass?
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	Captain, a lot of these places barely have fax machines.
M	LT. NABULSI	Then start dialing. Prioritize. Closest airports first.
M	SGT. HARRIS	You want to see it?
M	LT. NABULSI	Only if it will tell me where they are.
M	SGT. HARRIS	Not so lucky.
M	LT. NABULSI	How far is it to the Canadian border?
M	SGT. HARRIS	Four, five hours?
M	LT. NABULSI	Collero!!
M	ERIT	Excuse me? You call this coffee?
M	SGT. HARRIS	I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Police Department. We have a fugitive warrant for Lara and John Brennan, they are most likely traveling with their six year-old son, and we have reason to believe they might be flying out of your airport.
M	LT. NABULSI	How many airports in Ontario and Quebec?
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	Should I stop calling and count?
M	SGT. HARRIS	Yes, we are sending you photographs. We would appreciate it if you could disseminate them....How many terminals?
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	I got his parents!
M	OMITTED 321A	
M	AND	
M	AIR CANADA CLERK	Long way to go with just carry-on.
M	JOHN	You know how many times you've lost our bags?
M	AIR CANADA CLERK	I hear you.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	So, you just decided to go for a drive, for the entire day?
F	GRACE	George wanted to see the leaves.
M	LT. NABULSI	So you have absolutely no idea where they are going?
M	GEORGE	I told you. We never spoke.
F	LARA	I'll do this.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	Hello.
M	LARA (CONT'D)	Thank you.
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	Too bad you didn't find more of it.
M	SGT. HARRIS	Yeah. And wish I could figure out where this is.
M	SGT. HARRIS (CONT'D)	I checked websites for every tourist destination I could --
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	That's the presidential palace. It was all over CNN. When they deposed...what's-his-name.
M	SGT. HARRIS	We know where they're going!
M	AIR CANADA ATTENDANT (V.O.)	We'll now begin boarding by rows.
M	AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)	Sorry. There is no one by their description on the flight.
M	LT. NABULSI	They're on it. Do you have the photographs?
M	AIR CANADA ATTENDANT	Can I take this for you?
M	AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (V.O.)	We have the photographs. They aren't on this plane.
M	AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF	Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight?
M	AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)	No other flights. Anything else?
M	LT. NABULSI	....No. Thank you.
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	It's starting to rain.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	I'll call the FBI.
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	You ask yourself why we found this bag and not the others?
M	AIR CANADA ATTENDANT (V.O.)	The captain has switched off the seat belt light. Flight time to Caracas, Venezuela this evening is five hours and fifteen minutes. While in your seat, the captain asks--
M	LT. NABULSI	This guy was a teacher?
M	SGT. HARRIS	At a community college.
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	Was it raining when we searched the crime scene?
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	Three years ago?? What are we doing here?
M	DETECTIVE QUINN	Act like a cop. Grab the other side.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO	You're out of your mind.
M	DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)	You really thought you were going to find it?
M	DAMON	Good luck.
