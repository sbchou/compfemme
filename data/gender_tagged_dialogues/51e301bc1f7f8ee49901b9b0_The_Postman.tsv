M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	The last of the great cities died when my father was a child. Another victim of yet another war. The plagues followed. And the terrors. The living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. The ocean was barren. Poisoned. Near death.
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	Sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again. My father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief...
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't know. And if you ask me again, I'm going to slug you.
M	THE POSTMAN	It's been fun, hasn't it, kids? You're welcome!
M	THE POSTMAN	Damnit, Bill, you know I need to check it first!
M	THE POSTMAN	Better than turpentine. Tastes about the same. Your call, Bill.
M	THE POSTMAN	You ain't picky, Bill. I like that about you.
M	THE POSTMAN	'Running on Empty'? Tell me about it.
M	THE POSTMAN	Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147 channels. Everything from Jesus to 'Jeopardy'.
M	THE POSTMAN	'Like sands through the hour- glass, so are the days of our lives...' 'Michael Shields, come on down, you're the next contestant on...'The Price is Right'.' I'll take Domestic Nuclear Disasters for two hundred thousand, Alex...
M	THE POSTMAN	We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the Second Civil War... Well, shit.
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't want any trouble... I bet you don't either... Let's just call it a draw, okay?
M	THE POSTMAN	Look out, Bill!
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm rich.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm just passing through. I don't mean anyone any harm. Water's good.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm not a Holnist.
M	THE POSTMAN	Okay?
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm headed for a town called St. Rose. Somewhere west of Portland.
M	LEAD BANDIT	Portland's under twenty feet of water.
M	THE POSTMAN	Well, I heard different.
M	LEAD BANDIT	You mouthin' me?
M	THE POSTMAN	No, it's just that it's hard to get good information.
M	HULKING BANDIT	He is mouthin' you; I say we kill him.
M	LEAD BANDIT	Don't be in such a rush, Martin. Now I see a pack mule over there, but I don't see no packs.
M	THE POSTMAN	This is all I got.
M	LEAD BANDIT	Oh... Kill him, Martin.
M	THE POSTMAN	Okay! My stuff's up there!
M	BANDIT #20	What do you got in there?
M	LEAD BANDIT	Shut up. What do you got in there?
M	THE POSTMAN	Dried peas. Beef jerky. Cigarettes.
M	ALL THREE BANDITS	Cigarettes!
M	THE POSTMAN	Sure. There's the ladder.
M	BANDIT #20	Maybe he's got it booby-trapped.
M	LEAD BANDIT	You go up and get it.
M	LEAD BANDIT (O.S.)	Just you start tossing those cigarettes down!
M	BANDIT #20	Maybe he fell asleep.
M	THE POSTMAN	It's going to take a second. I got my stuff bolted in.
M	LEAD BANDIT	Put some buckshot through it, Martin. Just to hurry him up.
M	HULKING BANDIT	I only got three shells left.
M	LEAD BANDIT	So use his gun.
M	THE POSTMAN	Bill!
M	BANDIT #20	We're rich!
M	THE POSTMAN	It's true, we haven't done this in a while, but it's like riding a bicycle. Now, open your mouth.
M	THE POSTMAN	I know the rule. It's my rule! Avoid civilization at all costs. But we gotta eat, don't we? What are you so worried about, Bill? All you gotta do is stand there. I'm the one with all the lines.
M	THE POSTMAN	They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth, 'til Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane'!
M	THE POSTMAN	I said, Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane!
M	THE POSTMAN	Arm, arm yourselves! If the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here!
M	THE POSTMAN	Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. Out brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It's a tale told by a moron. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But blow, wind! Come wrack! At least we'll die with the harness off our back!
M	MRS. THOMPSON	The children have never heard Shakespeare before.
M	THE POSTMAN	They still haven't.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thanks. You're very nice.
M	CURMUDGEON LARRY	I'm clapping because you stink.
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't think you understand how it works.
M	CURMUDGEON LARRY	When I was young, I tried to be an actor. I was awful. But now I won't die thinking I was the worst one.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm glad I could help.
M	MRS. THOMPSON	Larry, stop it. You were very good.
M	THE POSTMAN	Good enough to get something to eat?
M	SENTRY	Holnists! Holnists are coming!
M	MRS. THOMPSON	It's okay. We give them food and supplies. All the towns do.
M	MAN #1	They hardly kill anyone lately. Just take a woman sometimes.
M	THE POSTMAN	Well, I'd just as soon not give them anything of mine. Let's find the back door, Bill. What are you doing there?
M	BETHLEHEM	I said, what are you doing?
M	MAYOR	It's just a game, General Bethlehem. Something they saw in a play. No harm in it.
M	BETHLEHEM	A play? Show me. It's all right, children, show me.
M	BRAVE BOY	Arm, arm yourselves! No running from the witches!
M	BETHLEHEM	Shakespeare, is it? Well, I'm sorry I missed it.
M	MAYOR	You should know, sir, we haven't nearly stocked the game we thought we would.
M	BETHLEHEM	Really? But you had time for a play?
M	BETHLEHEM	I'm taking three conscripts from each town. They will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army until such time as I see fit. Three men. You suppose you could do that?
M	IDAHO	All men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now.
M	BETHLEHEM	Acceptable.
M	IDAHO	Sir?
M	BETHLEHEM	Acceptable, Captain!
M	BETHLEHEM	You'll need to put some meat on, but I like an impressionable mind. Acceptable.
M	BETHLEHEM	Mongoloid. Unacceptable.
M	BETHLEHEM	I want pure blood. Someone like...
M	BETHLEHEM	That man.
M	THE POSTMAN	You don't understand...
M	IDAHO	You were required to show yourself.
M	THE POSTMAN	But, I'm not with these people. I'm just passing through. I --
M	IDAHO (O.S.)	Take the mule.
M	BANDIT #20	Hi.
M	THE POSTMAN	Hi?
M	BANDIT #20	Well... I mean, we know each other, kind of...
M	THE POSTMAN	Kind of.
M	BANDIT #20	Wow!
M	THE POSTMAN	So what did you guys do with my cigarettes?
M	BANDIT #20	We traded them for a woman.
M	THE POSTMAN	Wonderful. What happened to your partners?
M	BANDIT #20	They traded me to the Holnists.
M	GUARD (O.S.)	Ten hut!
M	BETHLEHEM	Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn. The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak. Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. You men have been saved from that fate. Redemption is within your grasp.
M	BETHLEHEM	You. What did you do before you were given this opportunity?
M	GANGLY RECRUIT	I had a shovel. I digged holes.
M	BETHLEHEM	You digged holes... Well, now you're going to fill them. And you?
M	THE POSTMAN	Me?
M	BETHLEHEM	Is there any question in anyone's mind that I was talking to you? Yes, you. You look like a dangerous man. Are you?
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm just a performer. Shakespeare. Stuff like that.
M	BETHLEHEM	Shakespeare?
M	THE POSTMAN	He was a writer. He --
M	BETHLEHEM	I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.'
M	THE POSTMAN	I, um, you want a line?
M	THE POSTMAN	'To be or not to be: That is the question.' contest.
M	BETHLEHEM	'We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.'
M	THE POSTMAN	'Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York.'
M	BETHLEHEM	You're pretty good. You're also a fighter. I see it in your eyes.
M	BETHLEHEM	Don't you agree? Come on, a man's got to speak his mind.
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't mean any disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off just letting me go. A fighter is about the last thing I am.
M	BETHLEHEM	Don't you think I should be the judge of that, soldier?
M	BETHLEHEM	Get up. I said, get up.
M	BETHLEHEM	Put up your fists.
M	THE POSTMAN	You'd win.
M	BETHLEHEM	Now fight.
M	BETHLEHEM	You're right. You're not a fighter. But you will be. I'm giving you a chance at a life that means something. A life worth living.
M	IDAHO (O.S.)	Let's move it. Everybody up and at 'em.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thanks. Did I win?
M	THE POSTMAN	I tried to tell him...
M	WOODY	Say it again.
M	THE POSTMAN	Say what?
M	WOODY	The words you said in town. About the wind blowing. And the rest... Say it again.
M	THE POSTMAN	'Blow, wind. Come wrack. At least we'll die with the harness off our back.'
M	WOODY	What's it mean?
M	THE POSTMAN	Live free or die.
M	IDAHO	All right, girls. We're gonna run. Twenty miles. With packs. You got three hours. Everybody makes it. Or nobody eats.
M	IDAHO	Eat up! You got meat tonight.
M	IDAHO	Why don't you tell Shakespeare what kind of meat that is.
M	COOK	Mule.
M	IDAHO	A godawful animal. The sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey. Can you imagine that?! There's no room in this new world for a bastard like that.
M	IDAHO	Uh uh. Any man last in line ain't hungry enough. You show up last, you don't eat!
M	BANDIT #20	I'll die before I'm last in line again.
M	THE POSTMAN	That's what they're hoping for.
M	BANDIT #20	Serious? This isn't bad.
M	THE POSTMAN	These were supposed to be the best years of my life.
M	BETHLEHEM	The laws of eight, gentlemen. That is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn.
M	RECRUITS	God rest his soul!
M	THE POSTMAN	May he burn in hell.
M	BETHLEHEM	These are the laws that we live by. The eight is our symbol. Each man will bear it with pride.
M	BETHLEHEM	Only then will you be part of the clan. Sit down, gentlemen.
M	BETHLEHEM	Law One. You will obey orders without question. I told you to sit.
M	SLOW RECRUIT	There weren't enough chairs.
M	BETHLEHEM	I didn't specify chairs. You could've sat down on the ground.
M	BETHLEHEM	You disobeyed a direct order. You broke Law One.
M	BETHLEHEM	Law Two. Punishment shall be swift.
M	BETHLEHEM	Law Three: Mercy is for the weak. Four: Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six: Justice can be dictated. Law Seven. Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. Does any man here wish to challenge me?
M	BETHLEHEM	On your feet!
M	BETHLEHEM	Law Eight: There is only one penalty: Death.
M	SLOW RECRUIT	Please, I'm begging you.
M	BETHLEHEM	You will get out of this army what you put into it. Work and you'll be fed. Fight and you'll be respected. Die and you'll be remembered. It's up to you.
M	IDAHO	You thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan?
M	THE POSTMAN	No, sir. I'm a follower not a leader.
M	IDAHO	You see Colonel Getty? Always following the General? He's the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him. He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever since.
M	IDAHO	The General don't see it, but I say you got some nigger in you.
M	IDAHO	The General would like a word with you, Shakespeare.
M	BETHLEHEM	They're yours. A solitary man, aren't you? Binoculars. To watch life from a distance. And Shakespeare. To read about it instead of living it.
M	THE POSTMAN	No offense, General, but you seem to have read some Shakespeare yourself.
M	BETHLEHEM	If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated. Philosophy, history. Even a sense of the dramatic. Do you know what I did before the war? Do you think I was in the army? I sold copying machines. I was a salesman. The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me.
M	BETHLEHEM	If Nathan Holn hadn't come along, I'd still be selling copying machines. Can you imagine the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of it? But war... War gives men like me a chance.
M	BETHLEHEM	Here... 'The prize is often left unclaimed. Have the courage to grasp it. For fortune always favors the bold.' It always inspires me. I have a design for the future. A master plan. I'll need able officers to carry it out. You have the intelligence. If your heart matches, you'll go far. We'll talk more in the weeks to come. Dismissed.
M	BETHLEHEM	Issue the binoculars to a scout.
M	IDAHO	And the book, sir?
M	BETHLEHEM	Burn it.
M	BETHLEHEM	Quit moving.
M	BANDIT #20	What happened?
M	BANDIT #20	What did he say?
M	THE POSTMAN	Nothing.
M	BANDIT #20	Did he say anything about me?
M	THE POSTMAN	No.
M	THE POSTMAN	We got to get out of here.
M	BANDIT #20	What are you talking about?
M	THE POSTMAN	Escaping. You ever hear of St. Rose? It's on the coast. They say it's a paradise. They've even got electric lights.
M	BANDIT #20	We can't.
M	THE POSTMAN	Between the three of us, we could --
M	BANDIT #20	No, no. I can't. I like it here. I like being a part of something.
M	IDAHO	One of you dogs has earned himself a treat. Over there.
M	IDAHO	Those men hunted themselves a lion this morning. Must've been a zoo around here before the war. Anyhow, they shot him and he crawled into that thicket. A third man went in after him. We don't know if he's dead or alive. I need a volunteer. Someone's gotta go in and get our boy out.
M	BANDIT #20	I'll go.
M	IDAHO	I guess size ain't a measure of courage, is it? Shakespeare!
M	BETHLEHEM (O.S.)	I don't think so, Captain.
M	BETHLEHEM	Come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak.
M	IDAHO	Maybe you'll find your St. Rose up there.
M	IDAHO	What are you waiting for, Christmas?
M	SOLDIER (O.S.)	Why are you stopping?
M	THE POSTMAN	I found him.
M	SOLDIER (O.S.)	He alive?
M	THE POSTMAN	Yeah.
M	SOLDIER (O.S.)	Bring him out.
M	IDAHO	Hurry up! You still got a lion to bag!
M	BETHLEHEM	In the water. Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place. excitement.
M	CONSCRIPTS	Go! Go!
M	BANDIT #20	I'll get him, sir.
M	THE POSTMAN	Just let me go. I don't want to be part of your army.
M	BANDIT #20	My army. I like the sound of that.
M	THE POSTMAN	Don't --
M	BANDIT #20	I got him! Over --
M	WOODY	They sent me to kill you.
M	THE POSTMAN	Come with me.
M	IDAHO	Good, boy. Get him.
M	WOODY	It's you or me.
M	THE POSTMAN	I know.
M	IDAHO	Finish it.
M	WOODY	No harness on my back. IDAHO
M	IDAHO	You want your St. Rose?
M	THE POSTMAN	Hey. How ya doin'?
M	THE POSTMAN	'Jerry Ball, Pine View.'
M	THE POSTMAN	So, arrest me. Here's a piece of good news. Jerry's decided to go to school to get his contractor's license.
M	THE POSTMAN	Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to know he lost a tooth.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thanks for being there for me. Here's to you. I consider my taxes very well spent.
M	THE POSTMAN	All dressed up. Nowhere to go.
M	THE POSTMAN	Well, that's easy.
M	THE POSTMAN	Greetings, Pine View, Oregon!
M	SENTRY #1	Just head back the way you came. Pine View ain't buying, ain't listening and don't give charity.
M	THE POSTMAN	Civilian, I'm on official business. I demand entry into the town of Pine View.
M	SENTRY #2	What the hell are you talking about?
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm through talking to you, buddy boy! Now get somebody with authority to open this gate!
M	BRISCOE	I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell are you?
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm a representative of the United States Government --
M	THE POSTMAN	Authorized by order 417 of the restored Congress to reestablish a communication route to Idaho and lower Oregon. Now open that damn gate!
M	BRISCOE	What does that mean in English?
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm your postman!
M	BRISCOE	Hand me your gun.
M	THE POSTMAN	Understand that tampering with or obstructing the mail is a federal offense. Furthermore, the Bolin Act requires you to provide all mail carriers with sanctuary and nourishment. Now open that damn gate!
M	BRISCOE	You got three seconds to get your ass outta here.
M	THE POSTMAN	Is Jerry the contractor here?
M	THE POSTMAN	Wait! I'm going to get something out of my bag.
M	BRISCOE	One!
M	THE POSTMAN	Paul Davis! 124 Vernon Street!
M	BRISCOE	Never heard of him. Two!
M	THE POSTMAN	Lois Kent! 14 Weymoth Lane!
M	BRISCOE	Three!
M	THE POSTMAN	Irene March! 478 River Road!
F	MRS. MARCH	Did he say my name?
M	THE POSTMAN	Oh, no...
F	MRS. MARCH	I'm Irene March.
M	THE POSTMAN	I have a letter for you.
F	MRS. MARCH	Would you read it?
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm sure it's personal. Please. Someone has to.
M	THE POSTMAN	We're delivering the old stock piles, but I'll accept all new correspondence as well.
M	TOWNIE	Just read it, will ya?
M	THE POSTMAN	'Dear Irene. Sorry I haven't written. Everything's so crazy. The strange weather. The food shortages. That farmer Nathan Holn causing all that trouble. It's hard to understand. David's home from the Army. The war was over before he even got there. Thank God for that. He's still my baby no matter how big he gets. We're going to miss you for Christmas, but maybe next year. All our love. Donna.'
F	MRS. MARCH	My sister in Denver. Fifteen years ago. Thank you.
F	MRS. MARCH	You're a Godsend. A savior.
M	THE POSTMAN	No. I'm just... a postman.
M	THE POSTMAN	I've been on the road a while. I could use a little something to eat --
F	MRS. MARCH	Oh, yes, absolutely... Is there anything else?
M	THE POSTMAN	Yes, there is! If there are dogs in this town, you have to leash them while I'm here!
M	THE POSTMAN	'Stop. Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman. Waaa-ait, Mr. Postman...'
M	FORD	Cleaned and pressed, sir.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thanks. Didn't somebody say something about dinner?
M	FORD	Yeah, I'm supposed to take you to Foster's. My name's Ford. Ford Lincoln Mercury.
M	FORD	Used to be John Stevens, but I changed it on account of I want to drive cars.
M	FORD	I live in that car. A 2003 Pontiac Sinatra. With a nine- banger and a Q-eight.
M	THE POSTMAN	V-eight. Eight cylinders. That means an eight-banger.
M	FORD	Were they fast?
M	FORD	A buck seventy-five on a strip.
M	FORD	A buck seventy-five? I thought maybe I could fix some of them up. It's nothing compared to what you do.
M	THE POSTMAN	The important thing to remember about cars is, you can't eat 'em.
M	MAN #1	Tell us about the government!
M	WOMAN #1	Yes, tell us everything!
M	MAN #2	Is there a President?
M	THE POSTMAN	Yeah. What's his name?
M	THE POSTMAN	You know, I'm pretty hungry.
M	THE POSTMAN	His name is, uh... Richard Starkey. From Maine. He has a saying. 'Things are getting better, getting better all the time.'
M	MAN #3	He a Democrat or a Republican?
M	THE POSTMAN	Parties are over with. The individual is what counts. You vote for the best man.
M	MAN #4	What about Europe? Any word?
M	THE POSTMAN	Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years old and she still kicks ass.
M	WOMAN #3	Is Nathan Holn still alive?
M	THE POSTMAN	He died. Skin cancer.
M	WOMAN #4	And the Holnists? They're still out there. What's the government going to do about them?
M	THE POSTMAN	The government's just getting started. You're on your own for at least eighteen months.
M	MAN #5	What about the Marines Corp?
F	ELLEN	Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just let this man eat?
M	THE POSTMAN	Never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I can't eat anymore.
M	THE POSTMAN	What?
M	THE POSTMAN	This?
M	THE POSTMAN	Almost fits.
F	ELLEN	That's not a toy, honey. That's very important. Give it back.
F	ABBY	Would you like to dance?
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't know if I can, I think I'm still on duty.
M	THE POSTMAN	It's been a long time.
F	ABBY	All you got to do is hold on.
M	THE POSTMAN	Is something wrong?
F	ABBY	How tall are you?
M	THE POSTMAN	About six feet.
F	ABBY	Are you smart?
M	THE POSTMAN	Smarter than some I guess. Why?
F	ABBY	Just wondering. Did you ever have the bad mumps?
M	THE POSTMAN	Never had the bad mumps.
F	ABBY	Have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that?
F	ABBY	So as far as you know, you have good semen?
M	THE POSTMAN	Is that a trick question?
F	ABBY	I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only asking because I want you to make me pregnant.
M	THE POSTMAN	It's got to be the uniform.
F	ABBY	This is my husband. Michael.
F	ABBY	We've been trying to have a baby for three years. We can't on account of Michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. So we need a body father. We could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. I've seen it happen. Things go okay until the woman starts to show. Then it can be bad. But you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail.
F	ABBY	He hasn't said 'no'.
M	MICHAEL	What do you say, mister? You'd be doing us a favor.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'll have to think about it. Mrs. March wants to give you something. He's right here, Irene.
F	MRS. MARCH	It's to my daughter Annie. She left five years ago. She was only fifteen. The last I heard, she was living up north...
M	THE POSTMAN	Look, Mrs. March, you should know that...
F	MRS. MARCH	Know what?
M	THE POSTMAN	Know that...
F	MRS. MARCH	I have a feeling about you. I know you'll do what's right.
M	THE POSTMAN	I got to get out of here.
M	OLD MAN (O.S.)	It's right around the corner.
M	THE POSTMAN	What is?
M	OLD MAN	What you're looking for.
M	FORD	I knew you'd come here.
M	THE POSTMAN	You did, huh?
M	FORD	How do you get to be a postman, anyhow?
M	THE POSTMAN	You have to be in the right place at the right time.
M	FORD	How could I do it?
M	THE POSTMAN	I thought you wanted to drive cars.
M	FORD	Not anymore. That was kid's stuff. This is real. So, where's the right place?
M	THE POSTMAN	Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only another postman can make you a postman.
M	FORD	Kinda like vampires, right?
M	THE POSTMAN	Something like that. You have to be sworn in.
M	THE POSTMAN	The organization's kinda shaky. It might not last.
M	FORD	What does?
M	THE POSTMAN	You'd meet a lot of people who don't believe in you.
M	FORD	I'll set them straight.
M	THE POSTMAN	It's a lonely job.
M	FORD	I've been lonely all my life.
M	THE POSTMAN	So have I, Ford. So have I.
M	THE POSTMAN	What the hell? Repeat after me.
M	POSTMAN/FORD	Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.
M	THE POSTMAN	Okay then.
M	FORD	Okay, then.
M	THE POSTMAN	No, no, no, I'm saying that. You just listen... By my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail. Congratulations, you're a postman.
M	FORD	I want you to know I'd die to get a letter through. Johnny, why don't you run along. I need to speak to this man.
M	FORD	I'll see you around.
M	THE POSTMAN	Sure thing, Ford.
M	BRISCOE	Johnny's real impressed with you. Whole town's real impressed with you.
M	THE POSTMAN	I take it you're not.
M	BRISCOE	Smarter than you look.
M	THE POSTMAN	What can I do for you, Sheriff?
M	BRISCOE	You can clear out. Or I can throw you out. Either way suits me fine.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm afraid you don't understand, Sheriff. I'm a government employee. Authorized by --
M	BRISCOE	You're not authorized by shit. You're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. And I want you out of my town.
M	THE POSTMAN	This is going in my report.
M	BRISCOE	These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman. They need something real. They need help with the goddamn Holnists. Are you going to bring them that? Didn't think so. All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. I aim to keep it that way. You can stay till morning. Then I don't ever want to see you again.
M	THE POSTMAN	Just leave it.
M	THE POSTMAN	I said leave it.
M	THE POSTMAN	Hello, Abby.
F	ABBY	You'll be leaving tomorrow?
M	THE POSTMAN	I guess.
F	ABBY	Everybody's up late writing letters for you to take. We're not supposed to waste candles like that, but they're so excited.
M	THE POSTMAN	How about you? Do you have a letter?
F	ABBY	I don't have anybody to write to.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'll find you a pen pal. Someone with interests similar to your own. Dancing, checking for mumps.
F	ABBY	You're funny. Hardly anyone's funny around here.
M	THE POSTMAN	I guess no one feels much like laughing.
F	ABBY	Have you decided yet?
M	THE POSTMAN	Oh, well, I've been thinking about it.
M	THE POSTMAN	Sure. Why not?
M	THE POSTMAN	God, you're beautiful. Sorry, I know you'd probably like to keep things more clinical. You don't even know my name.
F	ABBY	I don't want to.
F	ABBY	It would be easier for me if you closed your eyes.
M	THE POSTMAN	What about those?
M	FORD	These are going to Blue Jay. About twenty miles east. I thought I could take them.
M	THE POSTMAN	Okay. They're yours.
M	BRISCOE	I'm your escort out of town.
M	CITIZEN #1	We took a vote, Mr. Postman. We want you to have this horse.
M	CITIZEN #2	Now don't say no. A man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'll take it.
M	CITIZEN #3	There's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thank you.
M	CITIZEN #1	Where do you figure you'll go from here?
M	THE POSTMAN	Go?... Oh yeah... I'll head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight.
M	THE POSTMAN	Times seem hard right now. But you have to believe it's getting better. Birds are migrating again. The rains are back.
M	ELLEN & TOWN	'Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. For purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain. America...'
M	BRISCOE	You got a helluva nerve, whoever you are.
M	THE POSTMAN	Is Abby around?
M	BRISCOE	She and Michael are working the north meadow this morning.
M	BRISCOE	Well, you're on your own.
M	BRISCOE	Hey! Are you really who you say you are?
M	THE POSTMAN	If I come back with some mail, you'll know!
M	BRISCOE	God damn it!
M	THE POSTMAN	Eugene. Benning. Portland. Boston! Seattle. Boise... St. Rose, Paradise on the Pacific...
M	THE POSTMAN	Maybe one thing can still be sacred. All in all, not a bad gig, huh?
F	ABBY	What are you looking at?
M	MICHAEL	Everything.
M	SENTRY	Holnists! Holnists are coming!
M	BETHLEHEM	They don't usually look at me.
M	BETHLEHEM	Who's responsible for that?!
M	BRISCOE	Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay out of sight.
M	FORD	I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding from anyone. I --
M	BRISCOE	You stay out of this, or I'll lock you up myself damnit.
M	BETHLEHEM	You. You'll be responsible. Get him a torch.
M	BETHLEHEM	Set that flag on fire.
M	BETHLEHEM	Now throw it through the window of your 'post office.'
M	BETHLEHEM	The United States doesn't exist. That flag is an abomination.
M	BRISCOE	General Bethlehem. We're gathering the tribute, sir. Can I take your wagons?
M	BETHLEHEM	Make sure that fire doesn't go out.
M	BETHLEHEM	Good Lord. That, gentlemen, is a first-rate piece of ass.
M	BETHLEHEM	Tell the Sheriff I want to be introduced. She does not belong in a mudhole like this.
M	MICHAEL	Excuse me.
M	BETHLEHEM	You again?
M	MICHAEL	That's my wife, General. She's a married woman.
M	BETHLEHEM	Do you know what system of government we have here, son? A feudal system. Like the Middle Ages. With lords and vassals. That's you and me. Those lords, they had some ideas. If a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.
M	MICHAEL	Me and Abby have been married for three years.
M	BETHLEHEM	Sorry, but I wasn't invited to the wedding. Now, you've already done me one favor, son. Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.
M	BETHLEHEM	We'll be civilized about this. I want you to give me your blessing.
M	MICHAEL	Sir, I can't. You can't.
M	BETHLEHEM	Can't? I'm tired of can't. We had a great nation once. Do you know what made it that way? I can! Till the weak came along. The 'I can'ts' destroyed us. But I'm going to make us strong again. I'm going to be the father of a new nation. Do you know why it will be me?
M	BETHLEHEM	Because I can!
F	ABBY	Michael!
M	BRISCOE	You didn't have to --
M	BETHLEHEM	Didn't have to what, Sheriff?
M	BETHLEHEM	Your people seem seditious. You seem seditious.
M	BRISCOE	Aw, Michael...
M	BETHLEHEM	What am I seeing here? I'm waiting.
M	BRISCOE	Man came through here. With mail. Said he was a postman. Said the government had been restored back east.
M	BETHLEHEM	What government?
M	FORD	The United States government.
M	BETHLEHEM	Who said that?
M	BETHLEHEM	Which way did he go? Do not make me ask again.
M	BRISCOE	East.
M	BETHLEHEM	Send a patrol east. Send three more south, north and west. They'd better find him east.
M	FORD	I managed to save these.
M	BRISCOE	Take that thing off, Johnny. You want to die, too?
M	FORD	I'm headed south. With the mail.
M	BRISCOE	Don't be a damn fool.
M	FORD	What kind should I be?... Haw!
M	THE POSTMAN	Rachel Clark! Charlie Sykes! Graham Druitt!
M	VOICE	G.D. died last winter of flu.
M	THE POSTMAN	That's it for now, folks. There'll be more once a real system is in place.
M	MAN	Tell us about President Starkey!
M	WOMAN	What about New York City? Did they survive the plague?
M	THE POSTMAN	Survive? They got Broadway up and running again. There's a kid doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you wouldn't believe.
M	MAN #3	How much is it to mail a letter?
M	THE POSTMAN	A buck seventy-five.
M	MAN #3	That sounds awful cheap.
M	THE POSTMAN	The catch is the only currency recognized are silver American coins minted before 1964 and two dollar bills. Look for Thomas Jefferson. Of course, food is always acceptable as barter.
M	GIBBS	They won't open the gates, sir.
M	BETHLEHEM	What?
M	GIBBS	They say they got a representative of the restored United States in there. They say this army is illegal. They say --
M	CHUBBY SENTRY	Drop dead and go to hell!
M	BETHLEHEM	The Romans had an expression they used to scare their children. 'Hannibal ad portas!' -- Hannibal is at the gates. Do you know who Hannibal was? Of course not. A pretty girl like you wouldn't know a thing. Colonel Getty, get some men up there and open that gate.
M	MAYOR	What the hell are you doing?! Open the gates!
M	SKINNY SENTRY	Government's restored! We don't have to take their crap anymore!
M	MAYOR	Idiots!
M	CITIZEN #1	They're gonna kill us all.
M	CHUBBY SENTRY	No! Let's fight them!
M	MAYOR	With what? We got five guns maybe 20 rounds of ammo in the whole town! How do we fight them with that?!
M	THE POSTMAN	You don't. Negotiate a settlement. Give them extra supplies.
M	MAYOR	Okay. You're a government rep. You go tell them.
M	BETHLEHEM	Make it quick. I've got an attack to coordinate.
M	THE POSTMAN	General, um, they've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty.
M	BETHLEHEM	Do I know you?
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't think so, sir. I --
M	BETHLEHEM	You're the Postman, aren't you?
M	BETHLEHEM	The restored United States. Do these people really believe that shit? Who are you really?
M	THE POSTMAN	I am a United States Postman. Authorized by order 417 of the restored Congress to --
M	BETHLEHEM	I was at the Battle of Georgetown. I watched the White House burn to the ground. Don't try to sell me on any restored U.S...
M	THE POSTMAN	The new capital is based in Minneapolis. Inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome. You know, where the Vikings used to play?
M	BETHLEHEM	You're funny. Now, what are the terms?
M	THE POSTMAN	They'll open the gate and give you double what they usually give. Just don't hurt anybody. This was all a misunderstanding.
M	BETHLEHEM	Appreciate your offer, Postman. Problem is, you're in no position to negotiate. These people made it through the bugs and the riots and the three year winter. But they're not going to survive you.
M	BETHLEHEM	Law six, justice can be dictated. Kill him. And kill the restored United States with him.
M	CAPTAIN	In accordance with law eight and by the authority of Emergency Order 46, you are hereby --
M	BETHLEHEM	Get her.
M	BETHLEHEM	Colonel Getty!
F	ABBY	We can't stop now. They'll be coming after us.
M	THE POSTMAN	Abby...
F	ABBY	Don't move.
M	SIXTH SOLDIER	If you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now.
F	ABBY	You're right.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thank you.
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't think I ever had water soup before. Maybe next time we could try it with a little sand? Dirt? Wood? A twig garnish?
M	THE POSTMAN	You used to think I was funny.
F	ABBY	They killed Michael.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm sorry.
F	ABBY	How sorry are you?
M	THE POSTMAN	What's that supposed to mean?
M	THE POSTMAN	What's with you?
F	ABBY	You got the mark of eight on you.
M	THE POSTMAN	A mark doesn't mean I'm a --
F	ABBY	You're a liar. I should've let you die.
M	THE POSTMAN	Then, why didn't you?
M	THE POSTMAN	You were with Bethlehem. Does that make you one of them?
M	THE POSTMAN	Don't make me use this.
M	THE POSTMAN	Wind's come up. Getting colder too. Must be another storm --
F	ABBY	Anything else?
M	THE POSTMAN	I didn't mean for you to --
F	ABBY	Your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm hurt.
F	ABBY	You're lazy.
M	THE POSTMAN	Lazy?! I got a hole in my stomach. I'm weak. The two big meals around here are grass and snow. And we're running out of grass.
M	THE POSTMAN	Where are you going?
M	THE POSTMAN	You're not leaving me here, are you?
F	ABBY	This is the last of it.
M	THE POSTMAN	Give me a break...
F	ABBY	I'm going to check the pass.
M	THE POSTMAN	Why are you in such a hurry to get out of here? I can think of worse places. And worse company to --
M	THE POSTMAN	You can't play tic-tac-toe with yourself.
F	ABBY	Help!
M	THE POSTMAN	I can't help you.
F	ABBY	I told you that's all there was.
M	THE POSTMAN	That's why you should have it.
F	ABBY	I knew you could walk.
M	THE POSTMAN	You're weird, you know that?
M	THE POSTMAN	We walked on the moon once, Abby.
F	ABBY	So? What good is that now?
M	THE POSTMAN	Obviously you've forgotten Tang and microwave ovens. Your face looks pretty.
M	THE POSTMAN	Not so bruised.
F	ABBY	Look, there's something you'd better know. You're going to find out soon enough. I'm pregnant. It's Michael's baby. You're just the body father.
M	THE POSTMAN	How do you know it's mine and not Bethlehem's?
F	ABBY	He tried with me almost every night. He couldn't do it. So he beat me. Said it was my fault. HANDS
M	THE POSTMAN	Abby.
M	THE POSTMAN	What is it? What's wrong? Is it the baby?
F	ABBY	The pass is clear. It's time to go.
M	THE POSTMAN	What happened?
M	THE POSTMAN	You got our stuff out.
F	ABBY	Of course.
M	THE POSTMAN	Of course? I don't understand.
F	ABBY	I set the fire.
M	THE POSTMAN	Am I missing the point here?
F	ABBY	You didn't think we'd stay here forever, did you? I'd appreciate if you'd walk with me long enough to find someplace safe for the baby. Then we can split up. You shaved.
M	THE POSTMAN	Yeah...
F	ABBY	It looks nice.
M	THE POSTMAN	You're really weird, you know that?
M	THE POSTMAN	Have you ever heard of St. Rose, Abby?
F	ABBY	I've heard people talk. I've heard lots of names. Bliss. Hesperia. New Eden. Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy.
M	THE POSTMAN	He's wrong. St. Rose is out there. And I'm going to find it.
F	ABBY	But you're The Postman.
M	THE POSTMAN	Look, I'm nobody, Abby. I'm just...
M	THE POSTMAN	This is what I hate. Strangers. Do you say 'hi' or do you blow their head off? Do they want to share what they got or take what you have? And if they want to take, how far are you willing to go to stop them? Damn it. All right. That's far enough.
M	THE POSTMAN	We don't want any trouble.
M	RIDER	Me neither, mister.
F	ABBY	What are you? Carrier 18. U.S. Postal Service. Got any mail?
M	THE POSTMAN	That's impossible.
M	PONYTAIL	Ain't you heard of The Postman?
F	ABBY	No, tell us.
M	PONYTAIL	He's only the greatest man who ever lived. He crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of General Bethlehem himself. He's back east with President Starkey right now.
M	THE POSTMAN	Who told you all this?
M	PONYTAIL	Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury. He's in direct contact with the restored congress.
M	THE POSTMAN	Direct contact... I don't believe this.
M	PONYTAIL	Do you have mail, or don't you?
M	THE POSTMAN	You said Carrier Eighteen. That mean there's eighteen of you?
M	PONYTAIL	Thirty-two. As of midnight.
M	CHUBBY	You got another letter?
M	FORD	More recruits?
M	RED	Seven of them. They're coming from everywhere.
M	CHUBBY	Did you get a letter or didn't you?
M	FORD	Gather 'round, everybody. Got another letter here. Came in last night.
M	THE POSTMAN	What's all this?
M	YOUNG CARRIER	Postman sent Ford another letter. He's gonna read it.
M	FORD	'Hello, all postal carriers.'
M	CARRIERS	Hello!
M	FORD	I'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey, but my thoughts are with you. Remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. Keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. Signed, The Postman.
M	PONYTAIL	His letters are always kind of short.
M	FORD	Hold on now. There's a P.S... Anybody know what P.S. stands for?
M	CHUBBY	Holy shit...
M	RED	That would be H.S., Chubby.
M	CHUBBY	I seen him once when I lived in Benning. It's The Postman!
M	THE POSTMAN	P.S. Ford knows what to do.
M	FORD	Guess you want to talk about this?
M	PONYTAIL	I found him! I found him!
M	THE POSTMAN	President Starkey? Minneapolis? Ford knows what to do?
M	FORD	I thought you were dead.
M	THE POSTMAN	So? I'm not making the connection. What's all this then?
M	FORD	I lied. I told people you were in contact with me.
M	THE POSTMAN	Why?
M	FORD	Because I didn't want it to end.
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't know how long I can stay, Ford. President Starkey will send word one day and I'll have to move on. Understand?
M	FORD	Sure. But you'll stay till he sends word? Right?
M	THE POSTMAN	Aw, don't do that. Hands down.
M	FORD	You'll stay 'til President Starkey sends word, right? Right?
M	THE POSTMAN	Yeah, till he sends word, right.
M	FORD	Could you say a few words?
M	THE POSTMAN	Two plus two equals four.
M	FORD	We bring all the mail here first. We sort it, group it and then it goes out. So far we got thirty routes.
M	THE POSTMAN	You spelled tyranny wrong.
M	CHUBBY	Boy, he's smart.
M	PONYTAIL/RECRUITS	Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night...
M	THE POSTMAN	How old are you?
M	OLD GEORGE	Seventy-five, sir.
M	THE POSTMAN	Can you ride?
M	OLD GEORGE	Nope. Can't walk too good, either.
M	THE POSTMAN	Why are you here?
M	OLD GEORGE	I know stuff.
M	THE POSTMAN	When did you get that?
M	OLD GEORGE	1970. A girl with eyes as big as saucers did me in a little town called Saigon.
M	THE POSTMAN	Abby --
F	ABBY	Yes?
M	THE POSTMAN	Ford wants me to have his trailer. Said it's the best one.
F	ABBY	I'm on the other side of town.
M	THE POSTMAN	I got plenty of room here.
M	THE POSTMAN	So much for the uniform theory.
M	BETHLEHEM	What do you think, Lieutenant?
M	GIBBS	Can't tell what it is if you stand too close. The colors all kinda run together, don't they?
M	BETHLEHEM	Yes...
M	BETHLEHEM	Well, if it isn't our old friend the U.P.S. man.
M	GIBBS	We captured him on the Oregon border.
M	BETHLEHEM	Who the hell are you?
M	CARRIER (PRISONER)	Carrier Twelve. United States, um, Postal Service.
M	BETHLEHEM	I want the camp struck at dawn. We're moving north.
M	GIBBS	Yes, sir.
M	BETHLEHEM	You spelled tyranny wrong.
M	THE POSTMAN	I wish they'd stop saluting.
M	THE POSTMAN	Just stay safe and remember. The mailman's more important than the mail.
M	CHUBBY	Boy, he's smart.
M	THE POSTMAN	What the hell?
M	THE POSTMAN	For President Starkey and the First Congress of the Restored United States, I officially declare Postal Station 10... What's the name of this town?
M	YOUNG LEADER	We never named it.
M	THE POSTMAN	I officially declare Postal Station 10 in Elvis, Oregon, open for business!
M	LITTLE BOY	I missed him.
M	BRISCOE	Phil, this better not be another of your U.F.O.'s.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm back! And I got mail.
M	BRISCOE	I'll be damned.
M	FORD	Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in. Dead or alive.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thank God it wasn't a carton of cigarettes.
M	BRISCOE	I'd have shot you myself.
M	BRISCOE	Things are getting better. Getting better all the time. I don't know who you are, but I do know I was wrong about you.
M	THE POSTMAN	Got a letter for you, Sheriff.
M	BRISCOE	It's from my sister. I thought she was dead.
M	THE POSTMAN	You thought wrong.
M	THE POSTMAN	Tell me about the baby, Abby. I want to know.
M	GIBBS	Births and deaths, the weather, gossip. There's nothing here.
M	BETHLEHEM	Nothing? Everything is here. Am I the only one who sees that? Get out!
M	BETHLEHEM	Give the people back their hope and their dreams won't be far behind.
M	BETHLEHEM	What is it, Getty?
M	BETHLEHEM	A military man, especially a commander, should keep a journal. After he's gone, it's the only real defense against the slander that arises.
M	THE POSTMAN	Who do you talk to?
M	OLD GEORGE	Not a soul in seven years of trying. But I will.
M	OLD GEORGE	Go ahead. Take a look. Want some?
M	THE POSTMAN	No. No thanks. Hey, don't let the kids see that.
M	OLD GEORGE	I was an aerospace engineer. I helped design the Galileo space station. I dream it's orbiting Earth forever. With a dozen human skeletons all grinning at each other. Laughing at us down here.
M	THE POSTMAN	What is it?
M	FORD	It's Red. He's overdue.
M	THE POSTMAN	That makes five. All on Southern routes.
M	BETHLEHEM	No. No. Not him. No. Children. I want a man and you bring me children!
M	GIBBS	Not yet. General wants the message to get back.
M	THE POSTMAN	Tell me about the other stuff you know...
M	THE POSTMAN	Ford, I want you to get rid of the bodies. I don't want these people blamed for what we did.
M	SENTRY	Halt! Identify yourself!
M	BETHLEHEM	Postage due...
M	BETHLEHEM	You want a war? I'll give you a war. I was born for it!
M	FORD/RECRUITS	Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom of night. Through bandit's hell, through fire fight. Through flood and plague we cannot fail. No Holnist trash will stop the mail.
M	THE POSTMAN	Get this mail sorted. Bring me a fresh horse. Something to eat.
M	THE POSTMAN	And all the mail going South!
M	THE POSTMAN	They changed the oath.
F	ABBY	Ford's idea.
M	THE POSTMAN	Figures. They don't think to ask who they're replacing. Or why.
M	LUKE	Sir? It'd be an honor if I could shake your hand.
M	LUKE	Sir?
M	THE POSTMAN	You look like... Do I know you?
M	LUKE	No, sir.
M	THE POSTMAN	Well, good luck to you.
M	THE POSTMAN	Nice kid. Probably be dead in a week.
F	ABBY	You're exhausted. You need rest. There's food in the trailer --
M	THE POSTMAN	Where are you going?
M	PONYTAIL	Route twenty-two. I'm already an hour late.
M	THE POSTMAN	You're grounded. Get off the horse. You know the rule.
M	PONYTAIL	What rule?
M	THE POSTMAN	Twenty-two's too far south.
M	PONYTAIL	But they're waiting on their mail down there.
M	THE POSTMAN	Get off the goddamn horse.
M	THE POSTMAN	Tie him off to this one.
F	ABBY	You can't keep doing this.
M	THE POSTMAN	Doing what?
F	ABBY	Riding all the routes. You're not saving anyone.
M	THE POSTMAN	Did I ever tell you how I got to be a postman, Abby? I don't know if you'd laugh or cry.
M	GIBBS	Ready!
M	SOLDIER	The post office, General?
M	BETHLEHEM	No. Let it stand. All by itself. So it can remind them what it cost them.
M	GIBBS	Aim!
M	GIBBS	Fire!
M	BETHLEHEM	You think you can ride? Then today's your lucky day.
M	BLOODIED CARRIER	Bethlehem says...
M	BLOODIED CARRIER	... he's... headed north. He's gonna kill ten people in every town. Then burn it to the ground. For what you did...
M	BLOODIED CARRIER	He said to tell you Pine View's on his way. He said he'd wait there, but not for long. I was so scared, sir... I thought they were going to kill me, too... I wish they would have...
M	FORD	What are you going to do?
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm going to stop this.
M	FORD	You can't.
M	THE POSTMAN	Get out of my way, Ford. All of you.
M	FORD	They'll kill you.
M	THE POSTMAN	Goddamnit --
M	FORD	You can't help them!
M	THE POSTMAN	There's still time, Ford!
M	PONYTAIL	You're hurting him.
M	FORD	No, this is all my doing. I went against your orders.
M	FORD	The Holnists we killed. You told me to bury them. But I didn't. I sent Bethlehem the bodies.
M	THE POSTMAN	Why?
M	FORD	Because Bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop.
M	THE POSTMAN	God damn you, Ford. Those people down there are dying because of us. Because of what we did.
M	FORD	Bullshit. They're dying because of Bethlehem. They're dying because this is a shitty world. And if we're ever going to change it, then somebody might have to die. If I could make it be me down there I would. But I can't.
M	THE POSTMAN	My God, what have I done? We don't even know their names...
M	PONYTAIL	We know their names. The little one's my brother. His name is Billy.
M	PONYTAIL	What Ford did was wrong. But it doesn't change anything for any of us. Does it?
M	BETHLEHEM	He's out there somewhere. Watching. I can feel it.
M	BETHLEHEM	You feel it too, don't you? Didn't have to end like this, Sheriff. He knew where I'd be if he wanted to face me like a man. Instead, he's hiding like a rabbit. So much for your Postman.
M	GIBBS	Ready! Aim!
M	BRISCOE	Ride, Postman! Ride! You hear me? I said ride!
M	BETHLEHEM	Fire!
F	ABBY	Ford thinks you're going to do something.
M	THE POSTMAN	I am.
M	THE POSTMAN	If I don't, those kids are going to keep on getting themselves killed.
F	ABBY	Ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do. All they've got is the lousy world we gave them. And this is the only decent thing in it.
M	THE POSTMAN	What? Being a postman? It's all bullshit, Abby. All of it. I took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm. I made up the rest to stay fed. There is no restored United States.
F	ABBY	I knew it was something like that.
M	THE POSTMAN	Weird thing is, being a Postman was almost the best thing that ever happened to me... Remember this? You left it behind that night.
F	ABBY	I remember...
M	THE POSTMAN	I always liked to think you left it on purpose. But maybe you just forgot it.
M	THE POSTMAN	Is this everybody?
M	FORD	The rest are on the overdue list.
M	THE POSTMAN	This is everybody. Got a letter from President Starkey.
M	THE POSTMAN	'Greetings all carriers.'
M	CARRIERS	Greetings, President Starkey!
M	THE POSTMAN	'I've been in contact with The Postman. I've received all the reports. I'm proud of you all.'
M	THE POSTMAN	In dark days, in a weary world, you gave everything and asked for nothing. You beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you. But the price is too high. I won't see anymore of my bravest die. It is my duty to hereby disband the Postal Service of the restored United States. You are to burn your uniforms and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once. Thank you and that is all.
M	FORD	The President never wrote that letter.
M	THE POSTMAN	If he could've that's what he would have said.
M	FORD	Who's the other letter to?
M	THE POSTMAN	Bethlehem. I'm taking it to him in the morning.
M	FORD	What does it say?
M	THE POSTMAN	Mail's private. You know that.
M	FORD	What does it say?
M	THE POSTMAN	It says it's over. It says we quit.
M	FORD	It says you quit. What about the oath?
M	THE POSTMAN	Tell me something, Ford. How much mail can a dead postman deliver? It's over.
M	FORD	Then I'll take it.
M	THE POSTMAN	I can't trust you.
M	FORD	If this is the end. If this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered. I'll take it.
M	THE POSTMAN	Whoever takes this letter probably dies for it.
M	FORD	I'm still a postman. You owe it to me... I owe it to me.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm going to St. Rose, Abby. And I'm taking you with me. I know you don't want to hear it, but that's my child inside you. I want to see it born somewhere safe. I have a right to that, Abby. Whether you like it or not.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thought I recognized you.
M	LUKE	General Bethlehem said... ... You should be on your knees when I do it.
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't give a damn what that asshole said.
M	LUKE	The general is a great man.
M	THE POSTMAN	The general is a fucking lunatic.
M	THE POSTMAN	You don't own a thought in that goddamn head of yours, do you? You want to see a man?
M	THE POSTMAN	That's a man.
M	THE POSTMAN	You don't understand, do you? You never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it.
M	THE POSTMAN	You ready? Yes.
M	THE POSTMAN	You're a better man than Bethlehem, Luke. I've seen it.
M	CHUBBY	Guess Minneapolis is that way.
M	THE POSTMAN	We can't help you. We're just as lost as you are.
M	BETHLEHEM	Good lord, what do we have here?
M	FORD	I'm a representative of the restored United States --
M	GIBBS	He's got a letter. Says The Postman sent it.
M	BETHLEHEM	A letter?
M	BETHLEHEM	'Bethlehem. This letter is my testimony to the fact that there is no restored United States and there is no Postal Service.' Then who the hell have we been fighting...? 'My carriers are returning home. In exchange, I'm asking you to let them be. The Postman.'
M	BETHLEHEM	He expects me to believe this?
M	LUKE (O.S.)	It's true, sir. I was there. He disbanded the carriers and rode west.
M	FORD	Traitor...
M	BETHLEHEM	Then I've won. I've won.
M	BETHLEHEM	You were supposed to kill him.
M	LUKE	I couldn't get close enough. This one's his second in command.
M	BETHLEHEM	Why doesn't that surprise me?
M	BETHLEHEM	Bring out the one we found yesterday. They can die together.
M	FORD	Who are you?
M	CAL CARRIER	Name's Clark. Postal Carrier of the restored Republic of California. Who are you?
M	FORD	Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.
M	CALI CARRIER	It's an honor.
M	BETHLEHEM	Wait a minute... wait a minute!
M	GIBBS	Sir?
M	BETHLEHEM	Hold your fire! You don't know each other? This will never be over. It'll go on except I'll be fighting a goddamn ghost.
M	GIBBS	Should we fire, sir?
M	BETHLEHEM	No goddamnit.
M	BETHLEHEM	No, I won't fight a ghost. Tabula rasa, gentlemen. A clean slate. I want all mail carriers hunted down. I want The Postman found. I want him dealt with. Colonel, organize the scouts. He rode west?
M	THE POSTMAN	I don't know him. Do you?
F	ABBY	Where do you think he came from?
M	SQUATTER	Howdy. Welcome to sunny California.
M	THE POSTMAN	What happened here?
M	SQUATTER	Little accident. The ground started to shake big time and the Hanford nuclear plant went... ... 'Poof.' Destroyed everything for miles. But the sunsets are beautiful.
M	THE POSTMAN	You ever hear of a city called St. Rose?
M	SQUATTER	Friend, I've never heard of St. Shit.
M	SQUATTER	Hey, don't go! I got Monopoly in the house! Boardwalk, Park Place and the Reading Railroad!
M	CHUBBY	You think that's President Starkey?
M	PONYTAIL	No.
M	CHUBBY	What makes you so sure?
M	PONYTAIL	President lives in a white house. That guy's place is gray.
M	THE POSTMAN	We can rest in there.
M	THE POSTMAN	Did you see that?
F	ABBY	I'm hungry, Postman.
M	GUARD	Set the rifle on the ground.
M	THE POSTMAN	This old thing? It isn't even loaded. Where are we?
M	B.C. MAYOR	You're in Bridge City. Where we don't allow guns.
M	B.C. MAYOR	Sentry said you were coming.
M	THE POSTMAN	I know you. You're famous.
M	B.C. MAYOR	I was once. Not anymore. Are you looking to cross?
M	THE POSTMAN	We will be. Right now, we'd just appreciate some food. I got some kids behind me, too.
M	B.C. MAYOR	How many?
M	THE POSTMAN	Three. Hey, guys, come on in! I know you're out there!
M	CHUBBY SENTRY	Boy, is he smart...
M	B.C. MAYOR	For you and your wife.
M	THE POSTMAN	Thanks. She's not my wife.
M	THE POSTMAN	Let me ask you something, have you ever heard of a town with electric lights?
M	B.C. MAYOR	St. Rose?
M	THE POSTMAN	Yeah!
M	B.C. MAYOR	Never been. But they say it's a ways down on the coast.
M	THE POSTMAN	How far?
M	B.C. MAYOR	Couple hundred miles at least. I couldn't say for sure.
M	THE POSTMAN	You seem like a decent man. And these seem like decent people.
M	B.C. MAYOR	We try to be.
M	THE POSTMAN	And this seems like a safe place.
M	B.C. MAYOR	You want to leave her?
M	THE POSTMAN	All of them. I'll give you the horses and my gear. Abby's special. She's strong. Probably end up running the place.
M	B.C. MAYOR	Why don't you take the night to think. Decide if that's what you really want.
M	B.C. MAYOR	They're looking for The Postman.
M	B.C. MAN	No such thing anymore.
M	B.C. MAYOR	Man on the horse says there is. Says he thinks he's here. Says he's coming back with friends.
M	B.C. BOY	What's a postman?
F	ABBY	You never heard of a postman?
F	ABBY	There used to be a postman for every street in America. They wore uniforms. And hats. Like this one...
M	B.C. BOY	Wow...
F	ABBY	My postman knew the name of every kid on my street. He knew our birthdays. He'd even find the baseballs you'd hit down the street. I can still see the smile on his face. The tip of his cap -- when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it. Mine always came just after school. You could set your watch by him. Unless you were waiting on something special -- like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart. Then it seemed like he'd never come. I used to think they could make time stand still.
F	ABBY	I don't think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone. Getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself. No place was ever too far away for the postman. So nobody ever had to be alone. The postman was someone you could count on. Things just made more sense when they were around. That's the kind of world we used to have. A world a lot of us took for granted. And now we've got this one. And it makes me wonder -- what kind of world do I want my child to live in? I want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren't just lies you tell yourself to get through another day. I want my child, and I want my friends -- I want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail.
M	B.C. MAYOR	Are you The Postman?
M	THE POSTMAN	Yes.
M	B.C. MAYOR	I've heard of you, man. You're famous.
M	THE POSTMAN	Yeah, I guess I am. And all of a sudden, I'm not wearing the right clothes.
M	B.C. MAYOR	Fact that we don't allow 'em doesn't mean we don't have 'em. We're not stupid, after all.
M	THE POSTMAN	I'm sorry I've brought this on you.
M	B.C. MAYOR	No need to be sorry. Long as we get our mail on time. Ready for duty, sir.
M	THE POSTMAN	The order was to burn all uniforms.
M	THE POSTMAN	You know what to do then?
M	PONYTAIL	Talk to the people. Gather who's willing. Tell them it's important. Tell them we can make a difference.
M	CHUBBY SENTRY	And tell 'em we're going to kick ass.
M	THE POSTMAN	Yeah, tell them that, too.
F	ABBY	This is hard for me. Michael was the best man I ever knew. I never thought there'd be another man I could love the way I loved him. I don't know why I've been so blessed. And I've tried to find a way to be thankful, but I swear, if I lose you...
M	THE POSTMAN	Abby, do you think a lie can become the truth?
F	ABBY	I don't know, but I believe in you. You have a gift, Postman. I saw it back in Pine View. You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again. You made Ford feel like he was part of the world. You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket.
F	ABBY	When you come back, we'll be waiting here for you. So you can take us to St. Rose.
M	B.C. MAYOR	There's three good-sized towns up that way. Enough folks to be a big help to you. If you can convince them to come.
M	B.C. MAYOR	A lot higher than it looks, huh?
M	B.C. MAYOR	Don't tell anybody, but I like to ride the damn thing just for the hell of it. Being a city official has its perks.
M	B.C. MAYOR	Trust me, man. This'll get you there a lot faster.
M	THE POSTMAN	How do I stop --
M	B.C. MAYOR	Don't worry about it. Good luck and Godspeed.
M	THE POSTMAN (V.O.)	Once more into the breach, dear friends, once more. Or close the wall with our dead. In peace nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility. But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger.
M	THE POSTMAN (V.O.)	Summon up the blood. Disguise fair nature with rage and lend the eye a terrible aspect.
M	OLD GEORGE	Steady, boys, steady.
M	GIBBS	In accordance with Law Eight...
M	OLD GEORGE	Get on with it, you floppy-eared sonuvabitch!
M	GIBBS (O.S.)	... We were outnumbered, sir.
M	BETHLEHEM	How many?
M	GIBBS	A least a hundred. With guns.
M	BETHLEHEM	With guns? Are you sure?
M	GIBBS	Yes, sir...
M	BETHLEHEM	Looks more like two hundred to me...
M	BETHLEHEM	Only thing worse than a coward is one who can't count. Lieutenant, do yourself a favor. Die well in this battle. In my army a deserter's life is a brief and unpleasant one.
M	BETHLEHEM	At last, someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me.
M	BETHLEHEM	Reckoning, gentlemen. This is the day I've dreamed of.
M	BETHLEHEM	They're an eager-looking bunch. Morale's a dangerous thing. Bring him up. I want this postman to see how the game is played.
M	THE POSTMAN	Stay here. No one moves until I give the orders.
M	SERGEANT	Are they surrendering?
M	BETHLEHEM	God, I hope not.
M	BETHLEHEM	My little shipping clerk.
M	THE POSTMAN	We're both a couple of frauds. You know it; I know it.
M	BETHLEHEM	Great men are made by other great men. Patton had Rommel. Grant had Lee. But I get you.
M	THE POSTMAN	You're no fucking general. You're a copying machine salesman. You're not even a good painter.
M	BETHLEHEM	Are you trying to goad me into a fight?
M	THE POSTMAN	Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them? We could settle this thing right here. You and me.
M	BETHLEHEM	Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
M	THE POSTMAN	It does in your army.
M	THE POSTMAN	I invoke law seven of the Laws of Eight! Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!
M	BETHLEHEM	What?
M	THE POSTMAN	I challenge you.
M	BETHLEHEM	You're not a Holnist. You're not a member of the clan. You don't have the right.
M	THE POSTMAN	I have every right. I invoke law seven!
M	THE POSTMAN	I challenge for leadership of the clan!
M	BETHLEHEM	Where do I know you from?
M	THE POSTMAN	'Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of war.' Remember that?
M	BETHLEHEM	Shakespeare. The one who didn't want to fight.
M	THE POSTMAN	I should've found a way to kill you then. But you seemed so strong.
M	BETHLEHEM	Law seven it is. This war is settled here!
M	BETHLEHEM	I study people. I know your problem. Do you know why you can't fight?
M	BETHLEHEM	You have nothing to fight for. You don't care about anything. You don't value anything. You don't believe in anything. That's what makes me better.
M	THE POSTMAN	I believe in the United States Postal Service.
M	THE POSTMAN	Neither snow... Nor rain... Nor heat... Nor gloom of night... Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds...
M	THE POSTMAN	It doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to kill each other. We can live together. We can --
M	FORD	Law three. Mercy is for the weak.
M	THE POSTMAN	Ford, don't...
M	FORD	Law eight. There is only one penalty and that penalty is death.
M	THE POSTMAN	He isn't worth it. I'm the head of the clan now! There are going to be new laws! Law one! No more killing! There's going to be peace!
M	THE POSTMAN	Who else? Who else has a law?
M	WOMAN	Everyone has to learn how to read.
M	THE POSTMAN	That's law two. Who else?!
M	CARRIER #1	Three. Liberty and justice for all!
M	LUKE	Four. No more tattoos.
M	CARRIER #2	Law five. Give peace a chance!
M	HOLNIST SOLDIER #2	Law six. Mercy is, it's okay sometimes!
M	CARRIER #3	Seven! Bring back vacations!
M	THE POSTMAN	How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury? You give us law eight.
M	THE POSTMAN	Be a leader, Ford.
M	FORD	Law eight...
M	FORD	... Live and let live.
M	BETHLEHEM	Would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts...
M	THE POSTMAN	Grow like savages -- as soldiers will -- that nothing do but mediate on blood.
M	THE POSTMAN	Somebody take a letter.
M	CHUBBY	Huh?
M	THE POSTMAN	A letter...
F	ABBY	Your daddy wrote to tell you that he'll be here as soon as he can. And that he loves you very much.
M	THE POSTMAN	Mail's slow. I'll have to see about that.
F	ABBY	Your daughter. Her name is Hope.
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	And so my father returned home after the Holnists were defeated...
F	HOPE	But he never did see St. Rose. There was too much to be done. He'd made a promise and in keeping it -- he traded one dream for another. With no regrets. And so, in honor of my father...
M	OLDER MAN	That was me.
