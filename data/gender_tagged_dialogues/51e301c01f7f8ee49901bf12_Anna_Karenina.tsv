M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	LEVIN	Good girl . . . good girl, Pava.
M	KITCHEN MAID	Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to spoil.
M	LEVIN	. . . her father's colour.
M	VASILI	Worth coming home for, Konstantin Dmitrich!
M	LEVIN	I stayed too long in Moscow.
M	LEVIN	. . . She's a beauty. That's twelve cows sired by Berkut!
M	AGAFIA	So one of you is doing what the good Lord made you for. PRINCE OBLONSKY'S HOUSE, MOSCOW HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY Prince Stepan Oblonsky-- Stiva to his friends--is 34 and liked by every-
M	MATVEY	What should I do with this?
M	OBLONSKY	Where did you find it?
M	MATVEY	In your hat. Your Excellency.
M	OBLONSKY	Yes . . . I picked it up somewhere for Daria Alexandrovna and the children. TIME--DAY Dolly picks up the youngest, Vasya, to kiss him and hands him to the
F	DOLLY	Bonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour, Grisha; bonjour, Tanya. DAY TIME--DAY OBLONSKY My Tanruchoshka! Mind my cigar.
M	OBLONSKY (CONT'D)	Be good today. I'm off.
M	mlle. roland	Read the chapter carefully. I'll come back to test you on it . . . Read it twice. 400 MILES NORTH OF MOSCOW TIME--DAY FLASH BACK-- SHORT
F	ANNA	Tsk, oh . . . Stiva!
F	ANNA	. . . and Dolly found a note from the governess. KARENIN Well . . . ?
F	ANNA	Stiva wants me to come to Moscow . . . to persuade Dolly to forgive him.
M	KARENIN	I'm to be deprived of my wife so that adul- tery may be forgiven? I can't excuse him just because he's your brother.
F	ANNA	It's for Dolly's sake too.
M	KARENIN	I have four committees today . . .
M	KARENIN (CONT'D)	Good, good!--I have the world waiting for me, there's never time to look at your exercises! LUKICH Sergei Alexeyich is doing very well, Your Excellency.
F	ANNA	Tsk-tsk, who put this shirt on you? Never mind. I'll come and hear you read.
M	KARENIN	Tomorrow, perhaps. Thank you, Lukich-- perhaps tomorrow.
F	ANNA	Alexei, do you think nine years of mar- riage and children should count for nothing against a . . . an infatuation?
M	KARENIN	No. Very well. But sin has a price, you may be sure of that. HOUSE--DAY OBLONSKY Dolly . . . please think of the children . . .
F	DOLLY	You think of the children! Their lives are ruined now! TIME--DAY
M	OBLONSKY	Oh, Dolly . . . I beg you . . .
M	MATVEY	Telegram. Should I send up the barber?
M	OBLONSKY	No, just the razor. MATVEY Don't worry, sir, things will shape them- selves, you'll see.
M	OBLONSKY	My sister Anna's coming tomorrow. We're saved.
M	DOORKEEPER	Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency . . . waiting outside.
M	OBLONSKY	Levin! Where did you disappear?
M	LEVIN	I'm very anxious to see you. I need your advice. OBLONSKY Well, then, come into my room.
M	OBLONSKY (CONT'D)	This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit- rich Levin! Someone send word I'll be a few minutes late.
M	OBLONSKY	I've been hard at it. Sit down.
M	LEVIN	Hard at what exactly?
M	OBLONSKY	Why, we're overwhelmed with work!
M	LEVIN	Oh--paperwork.
M	OBLONSKY	Paperwork is the soul of Russia. Farming is only the stomach. When am I going to come and shoot some snipe? Oh, but look at you, in Western clothes you told me you'd never wear again. Some- thing's up.
M	LEVIN	Yes. I'm in love. I've come back to propose. Have you guessed who she is?
M	OBLONSKY	I have a suspicion. Why didn't you propose when you were here?
M	LEVIN	I decided it was impossible. Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth-- but then I thought and thought, and . . . there's no life for me without her! . . . Do I have a chance?
M	OBLONSKY	Of course you do. The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening. Get there early before the crowd. If I may suggest . . .
M	LEVIN	Anything! What?
M	OBLONSKY	New boots.
M	LEVIN	Right. Anything else? OBLONSKY We'd better have dinner together.
M	OBLONSKY	No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom. Boots, and a coat. And a proper hat. NIGHT
M	OBLONSKY	It's so unfair. You marry for love, you're a good husband. Children arrive. Years depart. And all of a sudden your wife is tired, her hair is thin, her body . . . while you yourself still have your . . . vigour . . . and you find yourself distracted by a pretty woman . . .
M	LEVIN	Forgive me, but I find that incomprehen- sible . . . As though I'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop.
M	OBLONSKY	Well, you know, a freshly baked roll . . .
M	LEVIN	But I'm talking about love, and you're talk- ing about . . . your appetite.
M	OBLONSKY	Easily confused. Now look, do you know Count Vronsky?
M	LEVIN	Who? No. Why? OBLONSKY He's your rival. He turned up from St. Petersburg after you left.
M	LEVIN	Who is he?
M	OBLONSKY	You don't have to worry about him. He's one of those rich, good-looking cavalry offi- cers who've got nothing to do but make love to pretty women . . .
M	OBLONSKY (CONT'D)	Cabbage soup?
M	ELDERLY WAITER	Potage aux choux a la Russe, as the gentle- man ordered.
M	LEVIN	It's what I wanted.
M	LEVIN (CONT'D)	Understand that for me, tonight is a ques- tion of life and death. OBLONSKY Oh, Kostya! Kitty would be mad to refuse you. And Dolly is on your side, you know. She says her sister Kitty was always meant to be your wife and will be.
M	LEVIN	Dolly said that? I've always thought your Dolly's a gem.
M	OBLONSKY	Oh, she is, she is . . . I loved her to distraction.
M	SEROZHA	But why? ANNA Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives.
M	SEROZHA	But why?
F	ANNA	I told you, Serozha. She's not well. I must go to see her.
M	SEROZHA	But why?
F	ANNA	Now, don't make Mama cry. I'll be back before you know, and bring you a present.
M	SEROZHA	Don't want a present. I want you to stay.
F	ANNA	Oh . . . my little Kutik . . .
M	SEROZHA	What present?
F	ANNA	That's better.
F	ANNA	It's the first time I've left my little boy.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	So you are leaving your son and I am return- ing to mine. I am Countess Vronsky.
M	countess vronsky (cont'd)	I've been in St. Petersburg for the christen- ing of a granddaughter--my elder son mar- ried Princess Chirkov. You're a charming creature. Why don't I know you? ANNA I've never been in Moscow society, really.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	But you know my name?
F	ANNA	I've heard you mentioned . . .
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	Talked about, you mean. Ah, love!
F	ANNA	Was it love?
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	Always. My sons are ashamed of me. But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had--wouldn't you?
F	ANNA	I . . . I don't know . . .
M	LEVIN	I'll come back.
F	KITTY	Konstantin!
M	LEVIN	I'm too early.
F	KITTY	No! Come up! SAME TIME--NIGHT
F	KITTY	Look at me! I'm receiving for Papa and Maman who are late to dress. It's my first reception.
M	LEVIN	Princess Ekaterina! Delighted, delighted!
F	KITTY	I'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrich!
M	LEVIN	Kitty . . . you look . . . you look--
F	KITTY	Stiva told us you were back. How long are you staying?
M	LEVIN	I don't know. It depends on you.
F	KITTY	On me? He has got ahead of himself. Doors are flung open and the hosts, Prince and
M	LEVIN	What I mean to say--I came with only one purpose--I want to--will you be my wife?
M	LEVIN (CONT'D)	I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you?
F	KITTY	I can't. I'm sorry.
M	LEVIN	Yes. It was impossible.
M	BURISOV	Burisov. Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin? LEVIN Yes.
M	BURISOV	He's in Moscow, he's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka.
M	LEVIN	How do you know?
M	BURISOV	It's the sort of thing I know.
M	LEVIN	Count Vronsky?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	Princess Kitty . . . It's been so long, and yet it seems like yesterday. KITTY It was yesterday!
M	LEVIN	It's Kostya. NIKOLAI God, look at him! You look like a capitalist! What do you want?
M	LEVIN	Nothing. I came to see you. NIGHT
M	LEVIN	Good evening, miss . . . madame . . .
M	NIKOLAI	Don't talk to her like that. It frightens her. You sound like a magistrate. More vodka for my brother, quick about it.
M	LEVIN	I don't want anything.
M	NIKOLAI	I'm all right. Who told you where to find me?
M	LEVIN	A colonel in the Third Department. They're watching you.
M	NIKOLAI	Good. They must think I'm dangerous. What have you got to smile about?
M	LEVIN	Nothing.
M	NIKOLAI	That's right. The day is coming. I gave up my birthright for it. You're on the wrong side of history. Not because privilege is immoral but because it's irrational.
M	MASHA	He is sick.
M	NIKOLAI	Let go or I'll beat your lights out. I took Mary Nikolova from a brothel but I consider her my wife. If her presence offends you you're free to leave. Are you married?
M	LEVIN	No.
M	NIKOLAI	Why not? Are you waiting to fall in love?
M	LEVIN	No.
M	NIKOLAI	Good. Romantic love will be the last illu- sion of the old order. You should marry one of your peasants.
M	LEVIN	Yes. I damn well should!
M	NIKOLAI	The brotherhood of man.
M	LEVIN	Nikolai, you have to see a doctor. Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till you get your health back. NIKOLAI With my wife?
M	LEVIN	If you . . . or go abroad to a spa. I'll send you more if that's what you . . .
M	LEVIN (CONT'D)	What about the brotherhood of brothers?
M	STATIONMASTER	The private coach will stop opposite the carpet. VRONSKY Hello, what's this?
M	GUARDS OFFICER	Austrian royalty on their honeymoon. I've got them for four days.
F	VRONSKY	Bad luck. What do they like? Art?
M	GUARDS OFFICER	Food.
F	VRONSKY	Here's the train. TIME--DAY
M	STATIONMASTER	I'll see to it.
M	MAJOR DOMO	Second carriage, Your Excellency. I'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house. ANNA I'll come back.
F	ANNA	You don't look ashamed.
M	OBLONSKY	I am, I really am. VRONSKY Yes, of course. Oblonsky's sister . . . Karenina.
M	COUNTESS	Charmante, don't you think? Wait for me in the carriage. I'll take Tosca.
F	VRONSKY	. . . You stayed longer in St. Petersburg.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	Long enough for you to start a little love affair, I hear.
F	VRONSKY	I can't think what you're referring to, Maman.
F	ANNA	There, Countess, you have found your son and I have found my brother.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	Madame Karenin has a son, too. It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him.
F	VRONSKY	Excuse me for not recognizing you before.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	We passed the time telling each other about our sons.
F	ANNA	Yes, I've been hearing all about you.
F	VRONSKY	That must have been very boring for you.
F	ANNA	Au revoir, Countess.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	Au revoir, my dear. Let me kiss your pretty face. Countess Vronsky does so. Anna turns to offer her hand to Vronsky. As
F	VRONSKY	Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up.
M	OBLONSKY	. . . the sole support of a large family, they say. ANNA Can't anything be done for them?
F	VRONSKY	Wait for me, Maman.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	I've you to thank for that.
M	OBLONSKY	What a good fellow . . .
F	ANNA	Have you known Count Vronsky long?
M	OBLONSKY	Did you like him? He's in love with Kitty.
F	ANNA	Oh . . . But we should be discussing you and Dolly. She scolds him like a naughty boy.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	What have you got to say for yourself?
M	OBLONSKY	I've said it all--on my knees--in tears . . . Now I need you to say it. I'm going to the office, so you'll have Dolly to yourself.
F	ANNA	Don't be home late. MOSCOW--DAY
F	DOLLY	Kitty's coming by to see you. She's all grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the belle of St. Petersburg society!
F	ANNA	Is that who I am?
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Dolly, I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart. DOLLY I don't know what to do.
F	ANNA	I know, I know.
F	DOLLY	I can't bear to be with him. And he doesn't care, he's got what he wants.
F	ANNA	What he wants is you. He loves you, Dolly. You and the children are everything to him.
F	DOLLY	Are we? And there is room for a governess?
F	ANNA	That was shameful, disgraceful. But it was not love. It was the animal in man, not the soul. Stiva's remorse is from the soul.
F	DOLLY	What about me? Does his remorse make it easier for me?--
F	ANNA	I know you are suffering. But, Dolly, you must tell me . . . is there enough love left in your heart . . . enough to forgive him?
F	DOLLY	When I think of them together, I can't for- give him, no! ANNA My poor lamb. So you'd rather accept your fate . . .
F	DOLLY	My fate? But I haven't done anything! It's him WHO'S--
F	ANNA	Do you love him, Dolly?
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	You love him, and he loves you, but you can't forgive, so your lives must continue like this for ever, with both of you wretched. ANNA Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle--and look for another G for GRIGORI-- --here, darling, you can wear it till you go TO BED--
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Well, that's the end of that.
F	KITTY	Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball, Anna?
F	ANNA	Oh . . . I always feel dull at a ball.
F	KITTY	How can you ever be dull?
M	KITTY (CONT'D)	Stiva! Tell Anna she must come to the ball.
M	OBLONSKY	Of course she must. He cocks an eye at Anna: how did it go with Dolly? Anna moves her head:
F	ANNA	. . . and God go with you.
M	OBLONSKY	You can introduce me to your new governess.
M	TANYA	She's old! She's a hundred!
F	ANNA	I know why you want me to come. You want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night.
F	KITTY	How did you know?
F	ANNA	I know everything.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Oh, to be your age again . . . surrounded by that blue mist, like mist on the mountains that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying, beautiful valley you must enter to become grown-up . . . I was eighteen too, when I got married . . . TIME--NIGHT
M	SERVANT	. . . no, Your Excellency . . . He's just gone up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is there a message?
F	VRONSKY	No.
M	LEVIN	Will you go to confession? God will forgive you.
M	SERAFINA	And you also, master. He is watching.
M	LEVIN	God forgive us then, for committing the act of love. SERAFINA He is merciful.
M	LEVIN	"Not according to my deserts, O Lord, but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I even doubt that God exists.
M	SERAFINA	How can there be anything if God didn't make it?
M	LEVIN	I don't know. One day science will tell us.
M	SERAFINA	That's sinful talk if the priest heard you.
M	LEVIN	Well, I won't go to confession.
M	SERAFINA	Your father built the church. You're con- fessed a while yet.
M	SERAFINA (CONT'D)	Will you bring me something from Moscow?
M	LEVIN	What would you like? SERAFINA Soap, the kind wrapped in paper to look pretty, and smelling like for a proper lady.
M	YOUTH	Kitty! May I have a waltz?
F	KITTY	You may, Boris. I'll save you the third just because it's your first ball.
M	YOUTH	You're my first conquest. KORSUNSKY It's a relaxation to dance with you, Princess. But back to work! Where do you want to be taken?
F	KITTY	There.
M	KORSUNSKY	So that your ankles may be seen.
F	KITTY	How are you, Stiva?
M	OBLONSKY	Thanks to Anna, I am a happy man. Would you like to dance?
F	KITTY	No, ask Anna. ANNA No . . . I don't . . .
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Come on then.
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	. . . this vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours . . .
M	PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY	For goodness' sake, what have I done?
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	Levin is a thousand times better than this Petersburg fop. If he had royal blood my daughter wouldn't need him!
F	KITTY	Is anything the matter? VRONSKY No. You look . . . as lovely as ever, Princess Kitty.
F	KITTY	Don't ask me, Maman!
M	COUNTESS NORDSTON	He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll see. I call the mazurka the now-or-never.
M	AUSTRIAN PRINCESS	. . . we were shut up in the train for an hour! Anna steals a sidelong glance towards Vronsky but he is no longer there.
F	VRONSKY	Dance with me.
F	ANNA	I am not used to being spoken to like that by a man I met once at a railway station.
F	VRONSKY	I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you, I'm getting out of this operetta and going home.
F	ANNA	Then, for Kitty's sake. Countess Nordston finds Kitty sitting alone. Korsunsky announces the
M	COUNTESS NORDSTON	You're not dancing the mazurka? I won't have it.
M	countess nordston (cont'd)	I'm engaged by General Glub--I give him to you. THE MAZURKA . . .
M	KORSUNSKY	. . . the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . !
M	KORSUNSKY (CONT'D)	. . . and the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . ! Anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees Kitty staring
M	GUARD	Bologoye! Fifteen minutes.
F	VRONSKY	Can I be of service to you?
F	ANNA	I didn't know you were . . . Why are you leaving? VRONSKY You know why. I have to be where you are. I can't not.
F	ANNA	This is wrong. If you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as I will.
F	VRONSKY	I'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture--
F	ANNA	That's enough!
F	VRONSKY	Take the luggage home.
F	ANNA	Is Serozha all right? KARENIN Oh, is that all I get? Yes, he's quite well.
F	VRONSKY	Did you have a good night?
F	ANNA	Yes, quite comfortable. Count Vronsky.
M	KARENIN	I have to get back to the Committee . . . Well--were you a success?
F	ANNA	I? Oh--Dolly and Stiva . . . yes, I think so . . . DAY TIME--DAY
F	VRONSKY	I'll announce myself.
M	PETRITSKY	Vronsky! The master himself. Baroness, coffee from the new coffeepot for Count Vronsky.
M	PETRITSKY (CONT'D)	I hope you are pleased by this ornament to your quarters.
M	BARONESS	I'll be off home if I'm in the way. VRONSKY You're at home where you are, Baroness.
M	BARONESS	Ah!--Pierre, you never say such pretty things to me. We were just discussing my husband. He won't divorce me, you see. And do you know why?
F	VRONSKY	No.
M	BARONESS	Because he likes eating off my family silver.
F	VRONSKY	Ah.
M	BARONESS	I want to bring an action. Just because I'm supposed to be unfaithful, I don't see why I have to eat off Pierre's crockery. Look at it.
F	VRONSKY	It's my crockery.
M	PETRITSKY	How was Moscow?
F	VRONSKY	Provincial. NIGHT
M	SEROZHA	You've stopped.
M	SEROZHA (CONT'D)	Thank you for my present.
F	ANNA	Sssh . . . NIGHT
M	KARENIN	Time for bed!
F	ANNA	I'm writing to Dolly . . . and to Kitty.
M	KARENIN	You are . . . good.
M	KARENIN	What are they saying in Moscow about the new Statute?
F	ANNA	What new Statute?
M	KARENIN	The new Statute I carried in Council.
F	ANNA	No one mentioned it.
M	KARENIN	Ah. Really?
M	KARENIN (CONT'D)	Here it made quite a sensation. MOSCOW--DAY
M	FAMILY DOCTOR	Forgive me, Princess, but I must . . .
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	Am I the only one who knows what's wrong with her?
M	PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY	Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say you're the only one who can save her!
M	CELEBRITY DOCTOR	Possibly, Princess, possibly! At your service, Your Excellencies. Where is the patient?
M	CELEBRITY DOCTOR	Come, come, Princess, we are not backward people--I handle naked bodies every day. Deep breath now . . .
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	By God. I'll challenge the scoundrel!
M	FAMILY DOCTOR	It's the modern way . . .
M	PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY	You're not a doctor!
M	FAMILY DOCTOR	Her symptoms . . . loss of appetite, fast PULSE--
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some brute of a-- CELEBRITY DOCTOR Nervous palpitations. We must treat the nerves. A tubercular cavity is suspected, too soon to tell. Soden water every two hours. I must see her again tomorrow. Prince! Princess!
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	Don't you fret, my little Kate! You'll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself--"I feel well and happy and I'll go out for a walk with Papa!"
M	BETSY	I want to give a small dinner before the opera. Is there anyone you would like me to ask?
F	ANNA	Yes . . . Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St. Petersburg. HOUSE--NIGHT KARENIN Countess Lydia tells me you haven't been to one of her evenings since you returned.
F	ANNA	The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches. I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her. Come on, or we'll be late.
M	DEMIN	Here's the thing, Vronsky. A posting has come up and there's a promotion in it for you.
F	VRONSKY	Thank you, sir.
M	DEMIN	The garrison in Tashkent. VRONSKY Tashkent? But . . . I would like to stay in Peter, sir, if you don't mind.
M	DEMIN	I don't mind. But your mother . . .
M	BETSY	You didn't come to my dinner.
F	VRONSKY	I had to see my Commanding Officer. BETSY "She" didn't come either.
M	LYDIA	. . . work never ceases for great men.
M	Your husband is a saint and we must all	cherish him for Russia's sake. I hope you can come on afterwards--Father Kristof's report on the Chinese mission will be with lantern slides.
F	ANNA	I'm expected at the Tverskoys.
M	LYDIA	No doubt, but I'm sure Princess Betsy can wait for you, my dear.
F	ANNA	Yes. In fact, I think I won't go to Betsy's.
M	BETSY	You're caught.
F	VRONSKY	I'm afraid I am becoming ridiculous. HOUSE--DAY
M	LISA MERKALOVA	Now, there's a phenomenon, look-- Anna's shadow has arrived before Anna!
M	ANNA'S FRIEND	I'm Anna's friend . . . but this making-up- one's-mind-to-it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like Karenin.
M	PRINCESS MYAGKAYA	In my opinion Karenin is a fool, and Anna is the best of us. LISA MERKALOVA And we all love you for your contrary opin- ions, Princess.
M	BETSY	Alexei . . . You look desperate. That's not attractive.
F	VRONSKY	I'm losing hope.
M	BETSY	Hope of what? Persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows?
F	VRONSKY	And how is Tuskevich?
M	BETSY	That's not attractive either. Besides, I was never virtuous.
F	VRONSKY	No--you're right. She won't come. I'm going home.
F	VRONSKY	Turn round! HOUSE--NIGHT
M	VOICES	Wasn't Nilsson glorious? One sees that she has studied Kaulbach, of course . . .
M	There's something Louis Quinze about	Tuskevich . . . as if he came with the furniture . . .
M	BETSY	He's gone. But you're just in time for the surprise. Anna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the
M	vronsky (O.C.)	May I have the honour of bringing you an ice?
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	Ices are being served.
F	ANNA	I would prefer to try a cigarette. VRONSKY Courage!
F	ANNA	Thank you.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I'll try another one sometime.
F	VRONSKY	When?
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	Where?
F	ANNA	Just as I was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow. You behaved badly, very badly.
F	VRONSKY	And who was responsible for that?
F	ANNA	Give me a cup of tea. Betsy obediently gets up to fill a cup from the samovar. Vronsky follows
M	BETSY	How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has arrived.
M	LISA MERKALOVA	I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment.
M	PRINCESS MYAGKAYA	So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou- bles, and it was ghastly. We had to ask them back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty- five kopeks and it was a triumph.
F	VRONSKY	Were you glad to see me or not? ANNA This must stop. You make me feel as if I were guilty of something.
F	VRONSKY	What do you want me to do?
F	ANNA	I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you.
F	VRONSKY	No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I can do better than that. Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again.
F	ANNA	If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace.
F	VRONSKY	I have no peace to give. There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness. You are my whole life now.
M	BETSY	Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument. ANNA What?
M	KARENIN	I called to take you home.
F	ANNA	No, I'm staying. Send the carriage back for me.
M	KARENIN	Of course.
F	VRONSKY	Do you want me to go to Tashkent? TIME--NIGHT TIME--NIGHT
F	VRONSKY	So I'll go to Tashkent.
F	ANNA	No. I don't want you to go. TIME--NIGHT HOUSE--NIGHT
F	ANNA	Waiting up? How unlike you!
M	KARENIN	Yes, I stayed up to talk to you.
F	ANNA	What about? It's late. Where's Annushka?
M	KARENIN	I sent her off.
F	ANNA	Well, if you want to talk, but we should go to bed. KARENIN I have to warn you about something. Warn me? It's really rather late . . .
M	KARENIN	I wish to warn you that you may inadver- tently, by indiscretion and carelessness, give the world occasion to talk about you.
F	ANNA	I am not a committee. Please say what you want to tell me.
M	KARENIN	You and Count Vronsky attracted attention tonight.
F	ANNA	You don't like it when I don't talk to people, and you don't like it when I do.
M	KARENIN	I didn't notice anything, myself. But I saw that everyone else noticed. I consider jeal- ousy to be insulting to you and degrading to me. I have no right to inquire into your feelings. They concern only your conscience. But I'm your husband and I love you. It's my duty to remind you that we are bound together by God, and this bond can only be broken by a crime against God. ANNA I have nothing to say to you, and I'm tired.
M	KARENIN	And you have a son. TIME--NIGHT
M	KARENIN	Forgive me. If I am wrong, I ask your pardon.
F	ANNA	I don't know what you're talking about, and it's really too late for this. Excuse me, please.
F	ANNA	Too late. CLOSE-- SEX AS BEFORE
F	ANNA	Oh God forgive me. It's the end of everything--I've got nothing left now, only you. Remember that.
F	VRONSKY	Anna . . . Anna . . . how can I not remem- ber? You're my happiness. ANNA Happiness! You murdered my happiness.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Murderer. Murderer. Go on. Go on. Go on.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Yes. Go on. Go on. Go on.
M	LEVIN	I thought that had been done.
M	VASILI	I gave the order. What can you do with these people? LATER
M	OBLONSKY	Ah--potage aux choux a la Russe!
M	OBLONSKY (CONT'D)	Agafia!--if you opened up in Moscow, l'Angleterre would go out of business.
M	LEVIN	Of Babylon? No.
M	OBLONSKY	You're right, what do you care? You love the country--you've got it. You love agricultur- ing, and, Lord knows, you've got it. You love shooting--you've got it. You've got every- thing you want!
M	LEVIN	All right, go on, then. Have you stopped stealing bread rolls? OBLONSKY Ballet girl, oriental type. How can I help it?
M	LEVIN	So, nothing new to tell me. How is--how are the Shcherbatskys?
M	OBLONSKY	You mean Kitty.
M	LEVIN	I . . . Is she engaged now?
M	OBLONSKY	No. Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg.
M	OBLONSKY (CONT'D)	Kitty will be at Ergoshovo visiting Dolly in the summer. You could . . .
M	LEVIN	Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer! And I've got extra land this year at Kashin for the haymaking.
M	OBLONSKY	Kashin? That's on the Ergoshovo road, isn't it? Won't you call when Kitty is there?
M	LEVIN	Especially not then. I humiliated myself once. OBLONSKY Damn you, Kostya, you love Kitty and you can't forgive her because, first, you funked it, then you bungled it, then you ran away from an eighteen-year-old girl who was made a fool of by a uniform. It's Kitty I'm sorry for--not you!
M	LEVIN	Her heart told her no. Did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me?
M	LEVIN	For you, getting married is . . . a social engage- ment. Not for me. For me, it's the condition of personal happiness and living the right way. I'll never again be carried away by passion. I renounce it. I'll have to find another way . . .
M	OBLONSKY	Look out--here they come!
M	OBLONSKY (CONT'D)	Bad luck!
F	DOLLY	There. Oh, I'm sore with his feeding! Would you like to hold him? Well, don't hold him like a parcel . . . It's Aunt Kitty, darling. . . . Little face . . . little fingers . . . look at you . . . Doesn't he make you ashamed of dwelling on your troubles . . . ?
F	KITTY	I have no troubles.
F	DOLLY	That man wasn't worth the tears, believe me.
F	KITTY	I don't care about him. I don't even think about him. Or her. Except to hate her.
F	DOLLY	Then we'll never speak of it again. There are better men waiting for you. Stiva says . . . Kitty, my lamb, did Konstantin Levin . . . ?
F	KITTY	What has Levin got to do with it? Anyway, I'll never get married. The whole business of . . . it's become disgusting to me . . . and look what it's done for you! Why do they call it love?
F	DOLLY	Because it's love.
F	ANNA	I want you to. I don't care about it.
F	VRONSKY	You should care. You're not supposed to. ANNA Pooh! Who says?
F	VRONSKY	Everybody. Doctors.
F	ANNA	You're squeamish. You a soldier! Would you faint?
F	VRONSKY	Anyway, someone might be watching.
F	ANNA	But I'm damned anyway.
F	VRONSKY	I'm not. I'm blessed.
F	ANNA	You love me.
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	Only me. VRONSKY No.
F	ANNA	Apart from Frou-Frou.
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	But me more than your horse?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	Are you happy?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	And you love me?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	How much?
F	VRONSKY	This much. ANNA This much?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	This much?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	This much?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	This much? And this much? And this much?
F	VRONSKY	Yes.
F	ANNA	And . . . this . . . much . . . ? So this is love. This.
M	KARENIN	Countess . . . I thought you would be at Peterhof now.
M	LYDIA	I've come from there. I'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year.
M	KARENIN	Anna wanted a change. She is spending the summer at Tsarskoe.
M	LYDIA	Near Princess Betsy. And . . .
M	LYDIA (CONT'D)	The Guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe. Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me but you are too tolerant! Your wife . . .
M	KARENIN	Oh, is this about my wife?
M	KARENIN (CONT'D)	My wife is beyond reproach. She is, after all, my wife.
M	ALEXANDER	Alyosha . . . a message from Maman. Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here, and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the message, but they'll all be at the races and you're expected to supper afterwards.
M	DEMIN	Gentlemen--I give you--the regiment!
M	ALEXANDER	I heard you turned down a promotion.
F	VRONSKY	That was Maman interfering.
M	ALEXANDER	Yes. And now she's come up with a princess for you. Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence. Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder. Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms. VRONSKY So they talk about me. I'm leaving, Sasha.
M	ALEXANDER	An assignation?
F	VRONSKY	Come on, I'll introduce you.
M	ALEXANDER	Beautiful. A man would come to no harm. Do you think you'll win tomorrow?
F	VRONSKY	Makhotin's Gladiator is favourite, sixteen hands--Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him, but she's got heart. Haven't you, my darling? VRONSKY Anna.
F	ANNA	Alexei, what is it?
F	VRONSKY	I couldn't bear not to see you before the race.
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	What were you thinking about?
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	Tell me.
F	ANNA	I'm pregnant.
F	VRONSKY	Ah . . . My love. Well, love was never a game to us. Here's an end to living in corners, existing day to day on lies. Yes, now we can be together.
F	ANNA	How can we, Alexei?
F	VRONSKY	Tell Karenin everything.
F	ANNA	Do you think my husband will make you a present of me?
F	VRONSKY	Leave him.
F	ANNA	Leave him and be your mistress?
F	VRONSKY	Yes. Run away.
F	ANNA	I would never see my son again. The laws are made by husbands and fathers.
F	VRONSKY	What, then? I'll never forgive myself for your unhappiness. ANNA Unhappiness? I'm like a starving beggar who has been given food.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I unhappy? No, this is my happiness! TSARSKOE--DAY
M	KARENIN	How are you, young man? Your tutor doesn't seem to be in evidence. We'll have a look at your lesson books.
F	ANNA	Alexei!--you got away at last. Can you stay?
M	KARENIN	Why . . . ? ANNA Go and find Vasily Lukich.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I have to change. Princess Betsy is sending her trap for me. Would you like to come?-- she's taking me to watch the race.
M	KARENIN	Races, surely. No, I'll come on later, and then I must get back to town. KARENIN DAY
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	Exquisite creature . . . you really ought to be the spoil of victory today . . . TIME--DAY
M	OBLONSKY	Princess! A bet! What do you fancy in the next?
M	BETSY	Kusolev.
M	OBLONSKY	I'm on Vronsky. A pair of gloves? BETSY Done! Alexander Vronsky . . . VRONSKY She lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground, rolling over, and
F	ANNA	Alexei . . . !
M	KARENIN	I'm here.
M	KARENIN (CONT'D)	Would you like to leave? ANNA
F	ANNA	Stiva! What are they saying?
M	OBLONSKY	Vronsky's unhurt--but the horse . . .
M	OFFICER	Her back's broken!
M	KARENIN	I'm asking you . . . if you wish to go . . . ANNA No, leave me alone.
M	BETSY	I'll bring her home, Alexei.
M	KARENIN	Excuse me, Princess, but Anna is not well and I want her to come with me.
M	KARENIN	You know . . . they say the Emperor dis- approves of the races . . . the danger of injury . . . but I . . .
F	ANNA	What?
M	KARENIN	I'm saying there is a value in manly sport, for the military-- ANNA I don't understand.
M	KARENIN	In my opinion, it's not the sport itself that's wrong, it's the spectacle, it's making a cruel spectacle out of--
F	ANNA	What are you talking about?
M	KARENIN	I have to tell you--
F	ANNA	Yes.
M	KARENIN	I have to tell you, you behaved improperly today.
F	ANNA	And how was that?
M	KARENIN	By making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell. Your conduct was improper. It must not occur again. I have said it before. You are going to say my concern is unneces- sary and ridiculous. You are my wife. I am wrong to think that . . . yes--perhaps I was mistaken.
F	ANNA	No, you were not mistaken. I love him. I am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me.
M	KARENIN	Wait, please. Move away. I will not have a scandal. Therefore . . . You will not see . . . this man again. You will behave in such a way that nothing is known against you, by society or by the servants. In return, you will keep the privileges of a return home. That is all.
F	ANNA	Are you hurt?
F	VRONSKY	What's happened?
F	ANNA	I told him I'm your mistress.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	He thinks I can give you up and go on living. VRONSKY No, you cannot.
M	MAJOR DOMO	Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and Madame Karenin!
M	BETSY	Alexei Aleksandrevich . . . congratulations. You're the only man my husband would do this for.
F	ANNA	Tell me your latest find for your library.
M	PRINCE TVERSKOY	Not in front of the Princess. Betsy draws Anna away for a moment.
M	BETSY	I can tell you're happy. You've put on a little weight.
F	ANNA	Both true. NIGHT TIME--NIGHT
M	KARENIN	Time for bed! NIGHT KARENIN . . . not that I care for decorations but . . .
F	ANNA	Alexei . . . I can't . . . I'm sorry . . . But I'm his wife now. I am having his child. NIGHT
M	KARENIN	Tell me what I did to deserve this. YOUNG PEASANT Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your rows when the field's all done!
M	LEVIN	How many mowers is it, Theodore?
M	THEODORE	Forty-two, master. In your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men . . . . . . though he never picked up a scythe himself. LEVIN The men don't like me for it.
M	THEODORE	They like what they're used to.
M	LEVIN	It settles me.
M	THEODORE	How is that, master?
M	LEVIN	When I'm mowing, I don't ask myself why I'm here.
M	THEODORE	You're here to be master, Konstantin Dmi- trich, to be your father's son, and father to a son who will be master after you, as it has always been by the grace of God.
M	LEVIN	My father owned you, Theodore. My grand- father owned your father. Owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold. Was that by the grace of God?
M	THEODORE	It was. Those were good times when your father had the keeping of us. That's my youngest you were looking at there. His young life is perilous now since the Free- dom came and work must be found. LEVIN It's true I was looking at him.
M	THEODORE	At his wife too, I dare say.
M	LEVIN	They look happier than I've ever been. Is it living simply that I'm looking for?
F	VRONSKY	He's some kind of prince at home. Exhaust- ing. Where is Tuskevitch this evening?
M	BETSY	Why ask me? VRONSKY Captain Makhotin . . .
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	I must leave you. I'm on duty tonight.
M	MAKHOTIN	Lucky woman. Give her my respects, and to Karenin if you see him.
M	BETSY	Don't. Would you compromise me? And Lisa?
M	STREMOV	I only say that a man who can't govern his wife has perhaps gone as far as he can go in government. DAY TIME--NIGHT
M	KAPITONICH	Good evening, Your Excellency.
F	VRONSKY	I am expected. TIME--NIGHT ANNA No!--no. I will not live like this!
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Waiting hour after hour while you're drink- ing champagne with naked actresses-- don't think I don't know!--Lisa Merkalova still calls on me.
F	VRONSKY	It's punishment enough that I'm on escort duty, without . . .
F	ANNA	Yes--I'm sorry--it's my demon, I can't help it.
F	VRONSKY	You wrote that you were ill.
F	ANNA	Did I? Well, I am! But don't worry! It won't be for long, I'll soon be out of your way--soon!
F	VRONSKY	Stop.
F	ANNA	No, it's true. I was told it in a dream. VRONSKY There, it was only a bad dream.
F	ANNA	Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby.
F	VRONSKY	That's all nonsense!
F	ANNA	Tell me it is, tell me it is. You love me. Only me.
F	VRONSKY	Your note said your husband would be out.
F	ANNA	He was late. Serves him right. And you. Why do you call him my husband? He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll--
F	VRONSKY	But it was awkward . . . a matter of your honour. You made an agreement.
F	ANNA	Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo!
F	VRONSKY	Your demon again! ANNA I'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me!
F	VRONSKY	Anna . . .
F	ANNA	Put your hand there. There! Did you feel him move!
M	STREMOV	I must respectfully ask Minister Karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colourful Gypsy tribes, of these schol- arly God-fearing Jews, and of--but I'm afraid I have lost the Minister's attention . . . KARENIN Who is here?
M	KAPITONICH	Only Madame, Your Excellency. TIME--NIGHT
F	ANNA	I wanted to see him because . . .
M	KARENIN	I do not wish to be told why a woman wants to see her lover.
F	ANNA	What are you . . . ?
M	KARENIN	I want his letters. I am going to Moscow tomorrow, and then to the provinces with a commission to investigate conditions among the Jews and Gypsies--whose conditions I infinitely prefer to my own. I will not return to this house until divorce has put you into the street. Meanwhile my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister.
F	ANNA	Alexei . . . please . . . leave me Serozha . . . !
M	KARENIN	Do you think I would let you have my son? You are depraved, a woman without honour. I thank God the curse of love is lifted from me. TIME--DAY
M	OBLONSKY	Levin! What . . . ?
M	LEVIN	I need your advice . . .
M	COUNTESS NORDSTON	Well, is he coming?
M	LEVIN	Am I late? Who is here?
M	OBLONSKY	Of course you're late! Come and meet . . . Countess Nordston. COUNTESS NORDSTON We nearly met at the Shcherbatsky's last winter.
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	Come into the fold . . .
F	DOLLY	Kitty is here.
F	KITTY	Konsantin . . . what a long time since we saw each other.
M	LEVIN	Since you saw me, but I saw you not so long ago.
F	KITTY	When?
M	LEVIN	You were driving to Ergoshovo . . . I was at Kashin for the haymaking.
F	KITTY	Oh, but why didn't you . . . ? LEVIN I'm so glad to see you. You're just the same.
F	KITTY	I hope not--I was young and silly in those days.
M	LEVIN	Months and months ago!
F	KITTY	And you haven't changed.
M	LEVIN	No. I haven't.
M	OBLONSKY	Permit me to announce--soup Marie Lou- ise, carp with asparagus, and roast beef! I went to the market in person! An extra place. TIME--NIGHT OBLONSKY Karenin!--I'm glad you came.
M	KARENIN	I've been on tour in the regions, a govern- ment commission . . . I'm sorry--I have come to tell you our connection must be severed. I'm going to divorce your sister.
M	OBLONSKY	Divorce? Dear me, what are you talking about? Don't be in a hurry. Stay to dinner and later talk it over with Dolly--
M	KARENIN	Prince Oblonsky, everything is over between our families. Alexei . . . divorce is one thing but dinner is quite another.
M	PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY	You Petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull, old-fashioned Moscow, but we know how to do things-- only the other day, I hear, Vasya Pryachnikov fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him.
M	OBLONSKY	Well, what's this government commission, Karenin . . . ?
M	KARENIN	What was the challenge about?
M	PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY	Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.
M	PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY	It was a matter of honour, defending a woman's honour . . .
M	KARENIN	It sounds like barbarism to me . . . And what if the lover had killed the husband?-- would that have preserved the wife's honour too?
M	COUNTESS NORDSTON	Still, not many of us can say that our lover died for love! KARENIN Love? Thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife.
M	COUNTESS NORDSTON	Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrich?
M	LEVIN	I would. But not for my neighbour's wife.
M	LEVIN (CONT'D)	An impure love is not love, to me. To admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness. Otherwise we might as well be cattle.
M	COUNTESS NORDSTON	Ah, an idealist! DOLLY . . . but she will be nobody's wife, she'll be ruined.
M	KARENIN	I tried to save her. She chose ruin.
F	DOLLY	Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me. You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her. It was Anna who taught me that.
M	KARENIN	I do not wish to forgive. I am not a cruel man. I have never hated anyone. But I hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me.
M	OBLONSKY	It's your turn to play us something, Countess.
M	LEVIN	Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you.
F	KITTY	What is that? LEVIN This.
F	KITTY	Do Not . . .
M	KITTY (CONT'D)	Did. Did Not.
M	KITTY (CONT'D)	The last word is Never.
M	LEVIN	I know what it says. Then. But now? Can You.
M	LEVIN (CONT'D)	Can you Forgive. And Forget. I never stopped . . . I BEG YOU TO COME. I NEED YOUR FORGIVENESS. I AM DYING.
M	KARENIN	Die, then.
M	KARENIN	How is your mistress?
M	KAPITONICH	Safely delivered of a daughter, Your Excellency.
M	KARENIN	So . . . she is well?
M	KAPITONICH	The mistress is very poorly. The doctor . . . TIME--DAY TIME--DAY
F	VRONSKY	She's dying. Please let me stay.
M	DOCTOR	Thank God! She talks only of you.
F	ANNA	Why doesn't he come? He is kind. He will forgive me.
M	MIDWIFE	He's here--look--look--can't you see him?
F	ANNA	I want Alexei! Why doesn't he come? Give me some water. No, I mustn't, it's not good for my little girl. Or let her have a nurse. Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her. ANNUSHKA He's come, my dear--look there . . .
M	DOCTOR	More ice.
F	ANNA	Oh, what nonsense. I must be asleep, that's what it is. You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him. No one knows him except me. I'm not afraid of him now.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I'm afraid of death, though.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Oh, my dear. Don't look at me like that. I am not the one you think. I'm afraid of her. She fell in love with another man. I'm the real one. But I'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too. Poor man! Let him come in. Alexis! Alexis!
F	ANNA	Take your hands away from your face. Look at my husband. He's a saint! Take his hand. Alexei--take his hands away.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Forgive him, too. Thank God, thank God . . . DAWN
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	So you came.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	If I had died as I wanted, you would be free of your troubles at last. KARENIN I am free of them.
F	VRONSKY	Whatever you think of me, please believe me, I love her--I could not have done other- wise than what I . . . what I did.
M	KARENIN	But you must leave now. I promise to send for you if she asks for you. I don't know what happened. I forgive you. I forgive Anna. My soul is filled with joy. I will remain with her and look after her for ever. Come now, come now . . .
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	Look at you. You look like what you are. A laughingstock. I fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment.
F	VRONSKY	I would like you to go, Maman.
M	COUNTESS VRONSKY	I will go when I'm ready to go. A little affair with a married woman puts a finish- ing touch to a young man's education--but this morbid, selfish obsession . . . ! You have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot- ten. You'd better come back to Moscow with me. You're finished here.
F	VRONSKY	In Petersburg? I'm finished here. DAY
M	LEVIN	. . . no, I'll go to her and tell her it's not too late to stop this business! Better now than when we're married and she realises she doesn't love me!
M	OBLONSKY	But she does love you!
M	LEVIN	How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose she's only marrying me to get married? Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky?
M	MATVEY	Your coat, sir. DAY
M	PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY	Konstantin!--what-- ?
M	LEVIN	I have to talk to Kitty.
M	PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY	You're not allowed to see her!
F	KITTY	No. I don't understand at all! What's the matter with you?
M	LEVIN	You can't love me. Think it over! Let people say what they like! KITTY Are you mad? Have you changed your mind?
M	LEVIN	Yes. If you don't love me.
F	KITTY	But I do love you!
M	LEVIN	Do you? Well, I love you!
F	KITTY	Oh, Konstantin! MIX TO DAY
M	BETSY	. . . and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face . . . ma chere, le scandale! . . . But I'd better tell you some regimental news . . .
M	KARENIN	Who is here?
M	FOOTMAN	Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency. No--I don't want to see him. . . . but your husband surely wouldn't . . .
M	KARENIN	Please excuse me.
F	ANNA	No--stay. BETSY I am so glad to see you. Everyone asks after you.
M	KARENIN	You look feverish.
M	BETSY	We have been talking too much--so I'm going.
F	ANNA	Princess Betsy came to tell me . . . Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye--he's going away. I have said I can't receive him.
M	BETSY	Goodbye, my treasure.
M	KARENIN	I agree with you. As he is going away, there is no need for Count Vronsky to come here. ANNA I have just said so, so there's no need to repeat it.
M	KARENIN	But it is for you to decide.
F	ANNA	Yes, and I decided.
M	KARENIN	Then I am very glad that--
F	ANNA	That we agree, so perhaps we can stop talk- ing about it.
M	KARENIN	Of course. Is there anything I can do for you?
F	ANNA	Yes, can you please please please stop crack- ing your knuckles. I'm a bad woman. But I can't breathe. Your kindness which I can't repay, and your FORGIVENESS--
M	KARENIN	You begged me for my forgiveness.
F	ANNA	But I didn't die and now I have to live with it! If only you would have gone on hating me. KARENIN But then--what? What? What do you want?
F	ANNA	Not to say goodbye.
M	KARENIN	I can't hear.
F	ANNA	Not to say goodbye.
M	KARENIN	You would be lost. Irretrievably lost. You would have no position. And worse if we divorce. You would be the guilty party. That means you cannot legally remarry. Your union with Count Vronsky would be illegitimate, and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name. And that is what you want! It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself.
F	ANNA	You forget something. Count Vronsky and I love each other.
M	KARENIN	And this love sanctifies a criminal folly? ANNA All I know is that I sent him away and it's as if I'd shot myself through the heart!
M	KARENIN	I see. And Serozha . . . ?
F	ANNA	I would die for him, but I won't live like this for him. When he knows about love, he'll forgive me.
M	KARENIN	Then I must choose the smaller sin. Vronsky robbed me of my cloak and I will give him my coat. I will give you grounds to divorce me, and I'll accept the scandal, the humilia- tion and the consequences to my career.
F	ANNA	No . . . I can't . . .
M	KARENIN	You may write to him but I would prefer you not to see him until you have left this house.
F	VRONSKY	You look like a boy. But so pale. We'll go south . . . to the sea air and sunshine . . .
M	SLYUDIN	. . . and Madame Odette in person, so to speak, Your Excellency, with your permission . . .
M	KARENIN	Madame Odette . . . ?
M	SHOPKEEPER	Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency . . . it's for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel- lency has overlooked. If you wish us to address ourselves to Her Excellency, please be so good as to tell us where we might . . . Countess Lydia arrives in full fluttering cry.
M	LYDIA	I have forced my way in! I have heard!
M	KARENIN	Countess, every shopkeeper has heard.
M	LYDIA	My dear friend! Don't give way to sorrow. Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care.
M	KARENIN	No, I'm done for. I don't understand any- thing. All day long I'm being asked to make decisions about bills and servants, the kitchen, Serozha's clothes . . .
M	LYDIA	I understand. I understand everything. I am going to act. The household arrangements you can leave to me. I will come every day. I will be a second mother to Serozha.
M	LYDIA (CONT'D)	He that humbleth himself shall be exalted! You must not thank me. Thank Him whose love pours through me! TIME--DAY
M	LEVIN	This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward . . . My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin.
F	KITTY	I am very pleased to meet you both.
M	LEVIN	And that was Kuzma. Come inside! VASILI Careful--door's still a bit . . . it's all right, it'll be dry tomorrow . . . DAY
M	LEVIN	Is it all right?
M	LEVIN (CONT'D)	Sit down a minute.
F	KITTY	No--I want to see everything.
M	LEVIN	A moment. AGAFIA . . . and now I'm doing kitchen maid's work because Nadya's parents won't let her set foot in this house, and who can blame them!--it's indecent! DAY
M	LEVIN	It's me, Konstantin.
M	NIKOLAI	Yes, good. The doctor here is useless--get me a doctor from Moscow.
M	LEVIN	Where did you go? I asked for you every- where, when I was getting married.
M	MASHA	I'm sorry . . . I couldn't leave him. I know I've done wrong. LEVIN Yes. My wife . . . You can't stay now. SAME TIME-- DAY
M	AGAFIA	I couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's orders . . .
M	LEVIN	Yes--yes . . . She's going.
M	LEVIN (CONT'D)	Did the doctor see her?
M	LEVIN	I will nurse him with Agafia . . . The woman will find somewhere in the village. You won't see her. She knows it's impossible for you to meet her. It is a torment to me that I have brought you under the same roof as this unfortunate . . . this fallen . . . and in your precious, in your delicate condition . . . SAME TIME-- DAY
F	KITTY	Good. A clean nightshirt and sheets. A towel and a clean pail of warm water. Ask Agafia for vinegar, and to prepare a bed somewhere for Masha. Wait.
M	KITTY (CONT'D)	And bring the perfume bottle in the outside pocket of my handbag. LATER
F	KITTY	I'm not looking.
M	NIKOLAI	I'm going . . .
M	LEVIN	Thank you, Father . . . and how much . . . ? PRIEST At your benevolence. It is a custom, not a levy, Your Excellency . . . Jesus overturned the money-tables outside the temple, but . . .
F	KITTY	You're such an expert on love, Kostya . . . why didn't you know it when you saw it?
M	LYDIA	Alexei, they're back! Here in St. Petersburg! She has written to me.
M	KARENIN	To you? . . . I think I don't have the right to refuse . . . It's the boy's birthday . . .
M	LYDIA	My friend . . . you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die . . . Let me write to her.
F	ANNA	I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich. TIME--DAY
F	ANNA	I have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich.
M	KAPITONICH	He is not up yet. Would you wish to wait? Who shall I say . . . ?
M	KAPITONICH (CONT'D)	Please come in, Your Excellency. Anna goes quickly to the stairs.
M	KAPITONICH (CONT'D)	Allow me to announce you. The tutor may be there and not dressed.
M	KAPITONICH	Please allow me! DAY DAY
F	ANNA	I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich. DAY TIME--DAY
M	KAPITONICH	He's been moved to the small sitting room. DAY DAY
M	KAPITONICH	I'll just look in.
M	SEROZHA	Mama.
F	ANNA	Oh, my dear little boy.
M	SEROZHA	I knew you would come. Today is my birthday. Are you crying?
F	ANNA	I won't cry. It's time for you to get dressed. And I almost forgot your present, look . . . open it . . .
M	SEROZHA	You don't want that . . . Let me see. Serozha tears open the package, lifts the lid of the cardboard box and finds
M	SEROZHA (CONT'D)	Oh, he's grand! DAY
M	KORNEY	It's your fault for letting her in!--you should be sacked.
M	KAPITONICH	Oh yes, you would have sent her packing! Ten years I've been keeping the door and the mistress was always kind to me. You should stick to stealing the master's clothes.
M	LUKICH	I've had enough of this--it's my job to get the boy out of bed before His Excellency comes . . . TIME--DAY ANNA Darling Kutik, Maman can't stay . . .
M	SEROZHA	Don't go!--he's not coming yet.
F	ANNA	Yes, I must, and you must love Papa-- he's better than I am. When you're grown-up . . .
M	SEROZHA	No one in the whole world is better than you. SAME TIME-- DAY
F	ANNA	Where's Anya?
M	ANNUSHKA	She's still asleep. Should I take your coat?
M	ANNUSHKA (CONT'D)	Are you feeling unwell, Madame?
F	ANNA	I'm not sleeping.
M	ANNUSHKA	I can send out for something.
F	VRONSKY	Why are you in the dark? Yashvin is going to call . . . you remember him. Are you going out?
F	ANNA	To where? To whom?
F	VRONSKY	What's the matter?
F	ANNA	I didn't know what happened to you.
F	VRONSKY	But I told you yesterday . . . My brother . . .
F	ANNA	Does it take all day for you to meet your brother? Does he need you more than I do?
F	VRONSKY	What's happened?
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	Well . . . Alexander agreed to everything. Mother's house in Moscow will go to him, and the country estate will be our new home . . . as soon as the divorce . . . Karenin hasn't answered your letter yet?
M	YASHVIN	It's wonderful to have you both returned.
F	ANNA	How good you are to come. You're the very first person to call on me since our return.
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	I received a note from Princess Betsy asking me if I'd call on her between six-thirty and eight. Or was it seven?
M	ANNA (CONT'D)	Alas, between six-thirty and seven is just when I'm unable to see her!
M	YASHVIN	But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight?
F	ANNA	I would love to be there if I could get a box.
M	YASHVIN	Madame, your box is number four! You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya. Will you come, Vronsky? Vronsky shakes his head. Yashvin kisses Anna's hand.
F	ANNA	I see why . . . Alexei is so fond of you.
F	VRONSKY	You know you can't go to the theatre?
F	ANNA	Annushka!
F	VRONSKY	For heaven's sake--
F	ANNA	A bath. I'll come in and choose a dress.
F	VRONSKY	Anna--I implore you--don't you know . . . ?
F	ANNA	I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done: are you ashamed for me? Why do you keep a room at the hotel? Aren't we together? Have you changed towards me?
F	VRONSKY	It's because I love you and care about you. ANNA If that's the case, I don't know why you aren't coming with me.
F	VRONSKY	That would make it worse.
F	ANNA	You're afraid. Well, I'm not.
M	PRINCESS MYAGKAYA	Anna . . . ! Something has done you good--you look wonderful. NIGHT
M	PRINCESS MYAGKAYA	Should we visit or stay put?
F	ANNA	Stay put. PRINCESS MYAGKAYA Minister! Congratulations. Come in for a moment.
M	princess myagkaya (cont'd)	Princess Sorokina and her daughter, they're from Moscow, neighbours of Countess Vron- sky, quite well off, no sons, she's a widow.
M	princess myagkaya (cont'd)	My dear, I'm a sales catalogue.
F	VRONSKY	You'll come up to see us afterwards . . . ?
M	ALEXANDER	Talk to Varya. Alexander indicates his seat to Vronsky. Vronsky sits by Varya.
F	VRONSKY	Will you call on Anna?
M	VARYA	Oh, Alexei . . . I'm fond of you . . . but . . .
F	VRONSKY	For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal!
M	VARYA	I'd call on her if she'd only broken the law. But she broke the rules.
M	PRINCESS MYAGKAYA	Who has made the decor? Haven't we got a programme? Colonel, would you be so kind . . . ?
M	YASHVIN	Of course. NEIGHBOUR Please . . . I would be honoured if you would take mine . . .
F	ANNA	Thank you, how very . . .
M	PRINCE TVERSKOY	Catullus, printed in Venice, 1501 . . . remarkable.
M	HOUSE MANAGER	A thousand apologies, Princess, but . . .
F	VRONSKY	Captain Makhotin . . . WIFE'S VOICE It's a disgrace! Take me home!
M	WIFE	Fetch my cloak!
M	WIFE	What are we coming to?
M	WIFE (CONT'D)	Is this the opera house or a--or a French music hall-- ?!
M	BETSY	Yes, why don't you? Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco. Alexei . . . you see why she must divorce. Marriage will solve everything. When will it be?
F	VRONSKY	As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife.
M	BETSY	But, as you saw, she isn't.
F	VRONSKY	We're going to Moscow, and then to my place in the country.
M	BETSY	That sounds like a good idea.
F	VRONSKY	But for a day or two, Anna will be at home, at my flat. Then, I'll say goodbye now.
F	ANNA	. . . you had an excellent night! Does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child?
F	VRONSKY	Either one.
F	ANNA	Don't make a joke of it. If you loved me, you would have locked me in to stop me going.
F	ANNA	Go to bed. VRONSKY Yes, it was my fault.
F	ANNA	I won't sleep.
F	VRONSKY	I know how to make you sleep. DOLLY Anna . . . I am very glad to see you. Are you well? How is your little one? Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vron- sky to the house but it's impossible . . .
F	ANNA	I understand.
F	DOLLY	No, no--you don't. Kitty and her husband are with us. She's in Moscow to have the baby.
F	ANNA	Kitty . . . ? Oh, tell her how pleased I am . . . !
F	DOLLY	Perhaps I'll wait a year or two. Oh . . . love!
F	ANNA	Yes . . . love! Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done?
F	DOLLY	No. I wish I'd done the same. But no one asked me! Well . . . I wouldn't have been brave enough. Stiva, you know . . . he doesn't change . . . like all men, I suppose. She doesn't notice her tactlessness but it lands on Anna, who manages a
M	ANNUSHKA	Madame . . . Madame . . . Are you ill?
F	ANNA	What time is it? Is Anya up? ANNUSHKA It's afternoon, Madame.
F	ANNA	I'm all right. It's all right. Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases. We've been here long enough.
F	ANNA	I had an inspiration. Why do we have to wait here? Why can't we wait in the coun- try? I don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it.
F	VRONSKY	Good! I'm bored here. When should we go?
F	ANNA	If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country.
F	VRONSKY	I didn't say you bore me. Moscow bores me. When should we go? . . . Tomorrow? ANNA I can't be ready by tomorrow.
F	VRONSKY	The day after, then.
F	ANNA	If you like.
F	VRONSKY	No, wait. That's Sunday. I have to see Maman.
F	ANNA	That's twenty minutes away in the train-- you could go to see her tomorrow--or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina?
F	VRONSKY	Please don't spoil everything. I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign. Oh, and then there's the bank . . . But we can leave on Tuesday.
F	ANNA	In that case, let's not bother. I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
F	VRONSKY	That's absurd! ANNA It's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here.
F	VRONSKY	Anna . . . Anna . . .
F	ANNA	You've stopped loving me. You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me. Why lie about it?
F	VRONSKY	Stop. I put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me I don't love you.
F	ANNA	Because I've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over! Finished.
F	ANNA	I'm sorry. I don't mind when we go.
F	VRONSKY	I'll telegraph Maman. We'll go on Sunday. I'll do anything you want. ANNA You should leave me.
F	VRONSKY	I don't want to. I love you.
F	ANNA	Why?
F	VRONSKY	You can't ask why about love.
F	VRONSKY	So--will you be all packed? I'll be out today making the arrangements.
F	ANNA	Is that your way of telling me you'll be at your mother's with that simpering little princess? VRONSKY No. I'll be with my lawyers. I'm waiting for some documents. Then I'm having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades.
F	ANNA	Well, I know what that means.
F	VRONSKY	My God, this is unendurable.
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	I can invite them here if you like.
F	ANNA	Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine in soci- ety, I won't eat with the band. Who was the telegram from?
F	VRONSKY	I didn't show it to you, because Stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know. Kare- nin promises nothing, but will consider . . .
F	ANNA	I told you I don't care about the divorce, so why hide the telegram? What else do you hide from me? VRONSKY I hide nothing from you.
F	ANNA	Why do you care about the divorce? What has it got to do with us loving each other?
F	VRONSKY	Until we're married, our daughter is legally Karenin's. I care about it because we need to be free to marry.
F	ANNA	You're perfectly free to marry anyone your mother wants.
F	VRONSKY	But we aren't talking about--
F	ANNA	Yes, we are, and, by the way, compared to your mother I'm the Virgin Mary.
F	VRONSKY	Is there anything you wish to say to me?
F	ANNA	So it's the child.
F	VRONSKY	She brought papers from Maman.
M	VRONSKY (CONT'D)	Anna?
F	ANNA	Unpack everything. We're not going.
M	ANNUSHKA	Anna Arkadyeva . . .
F	ANNA	When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him . . . I don't want to be disturbed. TIME--DAY
F	ANNA	Count Vronsky . . . ?
M	ANNUSHKA	He went out early, to the stables, he said.
F	ANNA	Oh, Annushka . . . I should have died. Do you remember?
M	ANNUSHKA	Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva . . .
F	ANNA	I've made him hate me. ANNA Tell Michael to hurry.
M	MICHAEL	Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the Countess. Anna's body jerks involuntarily. She half rises. The image, however, is
F	ANNA	Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina? COACHMAN No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at the house of Countess Vronsky. I'm waiting FOR HIM--
M	MAIDSERVANT	Look at that lace on her . . . STANDING HAY.
M	LEVIN	I'll be buying in feed before winter's over.
M	THEODORE	Well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly.
M	LEVIN	My soul! What's that? I know what my belly is. How do we know what's rightly? I believe in reason. THEODORE Reason? And was it reason that made you chose a wife?
M	LEVIN	No.
M	THEODORE	You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic--that's what's rightly about it! TIME--DAY The grown-ups are: Levin, Oblonsky, Dolly, the Oblonsky Nurse, Prince
M	LEVIN	Where's Ekaterina Alexandrovna?
M	AGAFIA	It's all right, the mistress is giving Mitya his bath. LEVIN I came looking for you . . . I understood something . . .
F	KITTY	And what was that?
M	LEVIN	He smiled at me.
F	KITTY	He's very advanced for his age.
M	KITTY (CONT'D)	What did you understand? Serozha picks up Anya like a parcel under his arm and walks on with her
