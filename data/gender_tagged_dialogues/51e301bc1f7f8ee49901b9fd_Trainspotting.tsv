F	RENTON	heroin?
F	RENTON	Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking winds, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit. sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster,
F	RENTON	with that filth.

F	RENTON	Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation. For this you will need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress; tomato soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption
F	RENTON	up my arse.

F	RENTON	awful: they reminded me so much of myself I could hardly bear to look at them. Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off junk at the same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it, thereby downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don't you think? And when all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry for myself, he insisted on telling me once again about his unifying theory of life. actually just shite. trajectory.
F	RENTON	So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
F	RENTON	footballer. sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven't wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am. obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it? over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having right -- bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to
F	RENTON	proper.
M	BEGBIE	Newman by the way. I'm giving the boy here the tanning of a lifetime. So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So

I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up. black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so what can you do?
F	RENTON	involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. That what he got off on: his own sensory addiction.

The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that? against Holland in 1978. MAN RENTON WOMAN
M	SPUD	guess this means I'll never get to have sex with Gail.

M	SICK BOY	fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
F	RENTON	Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.

Pile looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach. SHERIFF Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton, I understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The cooperation with this programme.

F	RENTON	never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost.

After all, this was boom town where any fool could make cash from chaos and plenty did. I quite enjoyed the sound of it all. Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting, subletting, subdividing, cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking away. There was no such thing as society and even if there was, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. For the first time in my

F	RENTON	
F	RENTON	RENTON there's final hits and final hits. What kind was this to be?
F	RENTON	unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton. ANDREAS RENTON

M	BEGBIE	RENTON you know, that sort of thing, but let's face it, I ripped them off. My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for
