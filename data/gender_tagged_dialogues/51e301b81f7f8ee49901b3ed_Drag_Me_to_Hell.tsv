M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	STEPHANIE	There is no friction, with proper diction. Good sounds abound, when the mouth is round. She catches herself on the last word, a hint of "Missouri
M	STEPHANIE	Round. Yawn. She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the
M	STEPHANIE	Well, you're a little cutie. A car's HORN blares, spooking the kitten. It darts into the
M	STEPHANIE	Hey! Slow down! The Van roars past. She pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks
M	STEPHANIE	Go on home. Shoo now! She heads for the Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back,
M	STEPHANIE	Shoo!
M	MEXICAN MAN	We keep getting the same thing. Because I'm not employed by an American company, they won't take my application until they get my solvency statement. And the Mexican Treasury Department says that's going to take at least four more weeks.
M	MEXICAN WOMAN	And the house will be gone by then.
M	STEPHANIE	It says, here your employed by Pemex?
M	MEXICAN	That's right.
M	STEPHANIE	Isn't Pemex a subsidiary of Union Oil? a MEXICAN MAN Yes. So? 0
M	STEPHANIE	So technically, your employer is an American company. I think we can make this work. I'll call you this afternoon and let you know. The happy couple shake Stephanie's hand and exit. ELLEN,
M	ELLEN	I need clarification on the shoe issue.
M	STEPHANIE	Okay...
M	ELLEN	First of all-- you know you've got the only perfect pair of black dress shoes in L.A. So was that a definite, irrevocable, "no way" or t just a rather not at this time, "no way"?
M	STEPHANIE	It's an absolutely, positively, forget about the shoes already, "no way". They're my only good pair and I need them in good shape for tomorrow.
M	ELLEN	What's Up?
M	STEPHANIE	Dinner with Ray's parents. Ellen picks up a desktop photo: A shot of Stephanie and her
M	ELLEN	Ray's got a nice butt. Really tight Stephanie takes back her photo.
M	STEPHANIE	1 --I know. Thanks.
M	ELLEN	He's a keeper. But I told you about his mom, she's another story. I used to waitress at her country club, and with her, it's all about what private school you went to and who you know. You still up for that promotion? That would help. Stephanie looks longingly to...
M	THE VACANT OFFICE	of the former Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The Stephanie turns back, pushing the thought away.
M	STEPHANIE	I'm not putting on a show. She'll either accept me for who I am or not.
M	ELLEN	Are you reading self help books again? The Kitten peers out through Stephanie's partially opened
M	ELLEN	Hello there! Ellen reaches for the Kitty but Stephanie waves her off.
M	STEPHANIE	--Shhhl I can't let my boss see him. Stephanie glances to her manager, MR. JACKS, a heavyset man
M	ELLEN	What about the shoes?
M	STEPHANIE	I told you. No. Now beat it. Mr. Jacks sneezes, rubs his nose. He looks suspiciously about
M	STEPHANIE	Uh Oh. You better bring the kitty home for me.
M	ELLEN	Sure. If I can take the shoes.
M	STEPHANIE	I told you, no. Mr. Jacks sneezes again, his eyes water. He turns to his
F	MR. JACKS	Has someone brought a damned animal into my bank?! Mr. Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading
M	STEPHANIE	Okay, fine! Take the shoes! As Mr. Jacks arrives at Stephanie's desk, he overhears:
M	ELLEN	Just don't expect me to take care of it. This catches Mr. Jack's Attention. He turns to the ladies,
M	STEPHANIE	Of course not. I'll take care of everything. And thanks for choosing Bank of California. Ellen plays along.
M	ELLEN	Okay. Then I'll see you later. I mean--- whenever the next time I'm in the bank. You know-- for a loan.
M	STEPHANIE	Goodbye. As Ellen passes, Mr. Jacks sneezes again, harder.
F	MR. JACKS	Someone has definitely brought an animal in here. He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits.
M	STEPHANIE	I don't see any cats. Or any animals.
F	MR. JACKS	Hope to hell, not.
M	STEPHANIE	By the way, I put the paperwork for the Mcpherson loan on your desk.
F	MR. JACKS	Mcpherson?
M	STEPHANIE	That big corporate loan I've been trying to set up? It's just preliminary but--
F	MR. JACKS	Oh, right. I'll look it over when I get the chance.
M	STEPHANIE	Mr. Jacks, I was wondering it you had made any decision regarding the Assistant Manager's position yet?
F	MR. JACKS	I'm still deciding. Right now it's between Stu and yourself.
M	STEPHANIE	Stu? The trainee? Stephanie turns to see Stu, the balding loan officer who sits
F	MR. JACKS	I know he's new but he's also quite aggressive and we like that. Don't get me wrong, you're well liked here, but we're also looking for someone who's not afraid to crunch the numbers and make the tough decisions.
M	STEPHANIE	Mr. Jacks, I feel that I'm perfectly capable of--
F	MR. JACKS	--I'll let you know as soon as,I decide. In the meantime, take him through our loan qualifying procedures... just in case.
M	STEPHANIE	Oh. okay.
M	MR JACKS	And would you mind taking your lunch now?
M	STEPHANIE	Sure.
F	MR. JACKS	And on your way back, maybe you could bring me a turkey club? Stu overhears them as he passes by.
M	STU	Turkey club. Excellent choice, J.J. Then to Stephanie:
M	STU	Mind picking one up for me?
M	STEPHANIE	No problem. Jacks heads back toward his desk. Stephanie grabs her purse
M	STU	On toasted rye! And spicy mustard! Stephanie doesn't like fetching lunch for the trainee but
M	STEPHANIE	Sure.
M	RAY	The conscious mind abhors uncertainty. It seeks a pattern or reason for everything. When we can't find that pattern or reason, we sometimes ascribe it's cause to the world of the supernatural. The spiritual world is created by the human mind to conveniently explain everything we can't. So when does a belief in the supernatural cross into the field of abnormal behavior? Where do you, the Psychologist, come in? When these beliefs negatively affect our patients activities of daily living. Their jobs, their friends, their sense of well being-- The class bell RINGS.
M	RAY	Tomorrow we'll be covering the clinical manifestations of psychosis. You'll find it all t referenced in the text. The students pack up their books. Ray smiles as he sees Ray grades papers.
M	RAY	How're things at the bank? How's that new position looking?
M	STEPHANIE	I don't know.
M	RAY	Really? You sounded so sure.
M	STEPHANIE	Well, now there's this new guy... they're considering him too. Ray sees how bummed out she is. He moves close, taking her in
M	RAY	That job needs somebody with your experience. They know that. Stephanie nods.
M	STEPHANIE	Oh, I've got something for you. She rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope. He
M	RAY	A 1925 Indian head! Hey, good find. Where'd you get it?
M	STEPHANIE	One of the tellers found it for me. Ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into
M	RAY	Thanks.
M	STEPHANIE	I'd better get back to work. She quickly gathers her things. Ray returns to grading his
M	RAY.	Doctor Dalton. It's the voice of an older woman, TRUDY.
M	TRUDY ON SPEAKERPHONE	Hello dear.
M	RAY	Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec? He turns from the phone, whispering to Stephanie:
M	RAY	I'll call you tonight. She kisses Ray and exits.
M	RAY'S VOICE	Nothing much. Just had lunch with Stephanie. And trying to get these midterms graded-- She halts as she hears her name mentioned on Ray's
M	TRUDY'S VOICE	--Stephanie? The one from the farm?
M	RAY'S VOICE	You know who she is. She's coming over for dinner tomorrow night to meet you and dad. doesn't sound...
M	RAY'S VOICE	What?
M	TRUDY'S VOICE	I mean she's just a teller at some bank right? Raymond there's a reason that your father and I raised you in a certain way. We have expectations.
M	RAY'S VOICE	Please, mom, not this again--
M	TRUDY'S VOICE	I heard that Julie Kulick is looking for someone to play tennis with. You know she graduated Yale law with honors. I'm told she's quite a successful attorney now. I gave you her number but her mother says you never called.
M	RAY'S VOICE	Because I'm with Stephanie. I'm not looking for anybody else.
M	TRUDY'S VOICE	Would it kill you to--
M	RAY'S VOICE	--Mom. I have to go. See you tomorrow night. Okay? Bye. A downhearted Stephanie quietly exits.
M	STU	She messed up my order. Stephanie heard that.
M	STEPHANIE	No I didn't, Stu.
M	STU	Steph, I said "no mayo".
M	STEPHANIE	You never said that. Stu rolls his eyes to Mr. Jacks. Stephanie caught Stu's look, but what can she do? She Stephanie looks to the source of the sound... The hand belongs to MRS. SYLVIA GANUSH, the aged woman who
F	MRS. GANUSH	Will you help me?
M	STEPHANIE	Of course. What can I do for you? Mrs. Ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen
M	STEPHANIE	Mrs. "Ganush"? The old woman nods.
M	STEPHANIE	This is a delinquency notice... it says that the payment on your loan was due a number of months ago. And this other document... is a court order for repossession. The bank is informing you of their intent to repossess-your property at 325 Brandon street, tomorrow.,
F	MRS. GANUSH	The trucks are there now. The men are packing all my things. Private things. Please, make them stop. This is my home for twenty years. And I make every payment until the sickness took my eye. Mrs. Ganush turns her head to reveal a milky white eye.
M	STEPHANIE	Well... do you have the payment with you now?
F	MRS. GANUSH	I hope to get it soon. I just need a little more time.
M	STEPHANIE	I don't think my manager is going to extend you anymore credit. I'd like to help but...
F	MRS. GANUSH	Please. Won't you try?
M	STEPHANIE	Okay. Wait here. Stephanie stands and moves off. The Old Woman picks through a Stephanie stands before Mr. Jacks. He acknowledges her
F	MR. JACKS	What's up?
M	STEPHANIE	I've got an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment.. They're in the process of repossessing her home. She's on a fixed income and she's had some medical problems. I was wondering if we could give her a break. Stephanie hands Mr. Jacks the loan file. He puts on his Stephanie glances over her shoulder. Mrs. Ganush looks around to. make sure no one's watching, then She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it
F	MR. JACKS	Apparently, we've already granted her two extensions. And you know on this type of foreclosure, the bank makes a sizable amount in fees. He hands her back the file.
M	STEPHANIE	out of her house.
F	MR. JACKS	Tough decision. Your call. He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies
M	STEPHANIE	I'll take care of it. Stephanie returns to her desk.
M	STEPHANIE	Mrs. Ganush, another extension on the loan is out of the question.
F	MRS. GANUSH	What?
M	STEPHANIE	I'm sorry.
F	MRS. GANUSH	No. Please, it's my home... I'm begging you.
M	STEPHANIE	I tried to talk my boss into it but he just wouldn't approve.
F	MRS. GANUSH	But where will I live?
M	STEPHANIE	Mrs. Ganush, you've given your granddaughter as a reference... It says here, she lives nearby... Wouldn't you be better off living with her?
F	MRS. GANUSH	I would not burden her.
M	STEPHANIE	Okay well, there's several fine "assisted living" facilities for the elderly.
M	MRS GANUSH	A nursing home? No. I will never live in one of those places1
M	STEPHANIE	Well, of course, that's your choice.
F	MRS. GANUSH	It's yours.
M	STEPHANIE	I'm sorry there's nothing I can do. Mrs. Ganush begins to sob.
F	MRS. GANUSH	I am proud woman, Miss Brown, and never have I begged for anything. But I will beg for you now. This one time. I humble myself before you.
M	STEPHANIE	That isn't necessary, please. Let's not make this personal. It's just the bank's policy. I'm really sorry Mrs. Ganush. Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly
F	MRS. GANUSH	Have mercy on me. Stephanie stands, tries to pull free, but the old woman will
M	STEPHANIE	Please, let go. Customers turn to look. Mr. Jacks glances up from his desk.
F	MR. JACKS	What the hell?
F	MRS. GANUSH	I, Sylvia Ganush, beg. On my mother's grave, I beg you.
M	STEPHANIE	Please, take your hands off me. But the old woman only clutches tighter.
M	STEPHANIE	t I'm calling security. She picks up the phone and presses a button.
M	STEPHANIE	Could you please come over? Mrs. Ganush finally releases her grip and bows her head in
F	MRS. GANUSH	You shame me. She composes herself. Then, slowly stands, puffing up her I begged you... Her one. good eye fixes it's hardened gaze upon Stephanie.
F	MRS. GANUSH	.and you shame me. Mrs. Ganush suddenly grasps Stephanie's arm. Stephanie tries
M	SECURITY GUARD	I think your business here is finished, ma'am. The Guard escorts Mrs. Ganush from the bank. Through the
F	MR. JACKS	That was one nutty old lady. You okay? Stephanie nods.
F	MR. JACKS	You handled that just right. And by the way, as far as the Assistant Manager's position... You're at the top of the list.
M	STEPHANIE	Thanks. Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home. Stephanie loads a pile of Stephanie looks closer. There's no one behind the wheel. She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief. It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer. Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled
F	MRS. GANUSH	You bitch! I pluck out your fucking eyes! Mrs. Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush's Ka-Thunk! A lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled The old woman HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie's hair only Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat, Both women are dazed from the impact. Stephanie regains her Mrs. Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's Mrs. Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the Stephanie tries to focus. A blurred image in the rear view The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but
M	STEPHANIE	I beat you, you old bitch! Next time take your Geretol! The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view. Stephanie The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete phanie's jaw. The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat. Then Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself, as the old
F	MRS. GANUSH	You shamed me. The Old Woman reaches down. Stephanie flinches. Mrs.'Ganush's
F	MRS. GANUSH	Lamia... Clouds move past the setting Sun. A shadow falls over
M	STEPHANIE	What--? What are you doing? Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button. But the old woman
F	MRS. GANUSH	You want it? Stephanie snatches the button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles
F	MRS. GANUSH	Soon it will be you, who comes begging to me. It begins tonight when you hear the cry.
M	STEPHANIE	What cry?
F	MRS. GANUSH	The Lamia. It's coming for you. A large black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie's face. She
M	RAY	What about a restraining order?
M	OFFICER NAIMARK	Well that's usually only something we do if there's a pattern of harassment. But like I said, we'll file a report and keep it on record in case you do have a continuing problem. But once we send an officer around to have a word with, her, I don't think she'll be bothering you again.
M	STEPHANIE	Thank you, you've been very helpful.
M	RAY	I just thank God you're okay. You are okay, right?
M	STEPHANIE	I'm fine. Ray waits, sensing that there's more to it.
M	RAY	Your fine, but...
M	STEPHANIE	I-- It's just that I could have gotten her another extension. But I didn't.
M	RAY	Loo]. You said the bank had already granted her two extensions. When you don't pay your mortgage you lose your house, what did she t expect?
M	STEPHANIE	I guess. A breeze. She shivers. He wraps his arms around her
M	STEPHANIE	Let's get our fortune's read! You're kidding right? She cajoles a protesting Ray through the front door of the
M	RAY	I just hope to God none of my students see me here. Five bucks says he's wearing a turban. A beaded curtain parts, revealing... Rham Jas, a small, dark skinned, fifty year old Indian man.
M	RHAM JAS	I am Rham Jas. Seer.
M	STEPHANIE	How do you do? I'm Stephanie Brown and this is Ray...
M	RAY	But you probably already knew that. Just kidding. Rham Jas gives Ray a tight smile.
M	RHAM JAS	How can I help you?
M	STEPHANIE	We'd like to have our fortunes read. Can you do that? Read the future?
M	RHAM JAS	I have the ability to see certain energies... Sometimes these ' energies are a foretoken of things to come. Sometimes not. Sixty dollars, please.
M	RAY	Sixty dollars? Isn't that a little steep for this kind of thing?
M	RHAM JAS	Then go. There are many who would claim to be seers. But they are not. Although you would pay them little... you would receive nothing. If you.are not serious, go. Rham Jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain.
M	STEPHANIE	Wait. She removes some bills from her purse but Ray waves her off,
M	RHAM JAS	Platinum card. Very good. He swipes Ray's card through the credit card machine. A sparsely furnished, dimly lit room. The walls are lined
M	STEPHANIE	Sorry. Rham Jas smiles back.
M	RHAM JAS	That's quite all right. So, you wish to know something of your destiny. Very good. We shall see what the fates have in store. Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains.
M	RAY	Freud said destiny was not an act of fate but rather something control our conscious choices.
M	RHAM JAS	That is true. But... "We should not pretend to understand the world only by intellect."
M	RAY	Carl Jung...
M	RHAM JAS	Yes. From his treatise "Psychological types".
M	RAY	Jung-- the New Agers' favorite psychologist.
M	RHAM JAS	Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation. Rham Jas takes a seat at the table, across from Stephanie.
M	RHAM JAS	Your hand, please. Stephanie extends her hand to Rham Jas. He closes his eyes
M	RHAM JAS	You,work with money.
M	TO	
M	STEPHANIE	That's right! 4
M	RHAM JAS	But... you've lost something.
M	STEPHANIE	No. I don't think so.
M	RHAM JAS	No. No, you're right. Something's been taken from you.
M	STEPHANIE	No, I- Rham Jas grabs her arm and turns it, revealing the threads.
M	RHAM JAS	A button.
M	STEPHANIE	Well, yes! Some Old Woman...
M	RAY	Well anyone can see she lost a button. So what?
M	STEPHANIE	But Ray, it was very strange. At the bank today. The old woman... the one I told you about... she plucked the button right from my sleeve.
M	RAY	Why would she do that?
M	RHAM JAS	If you would please, both be quiet. Rham Jae concentrates, his eyelids flutter. Stephanie appears He releases Stephanie's hand and stands. He moves away from
M	RHAM JAS	I think that is enough for now.
M	STEPHANIE	Wait. You saw something. What?
M	RHAM JAS	I'm sorry. I'm tired and I see it's become quite late. Of course I will refund your money.
M	STEPHANIE	Tell me. Please. Rham Jas hesitates, then...
M	RHAM JAS	A bad spirit has come upon you.
M	STEPHANIE	How?
M	RHAM JAS	Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a grave site?
M	STEPHANIE	No.
M	RHAM JAS	Do you play with Ouija board or confer with those who practice the black arts?
M	RAY	What is this?!
M	STEPHANIE	No. No, I didn't.
M	RHAM JAS	Then perhaps someone has cursed you.
M	STEPHANIE	Who? 0 Rham Jas turns her wrist, exposing the loose threads on her
M	CLOSE ON THE THREADS	where the brass button once was.
M	STEPHANIE	How did he know all that?
M	RAY	Know what? That you lost,a button?1 He makes some good guesses, stirs you up, leaving you with a lot of questions. And conveniently, his business card. C'mon, he's a scam artist.
M	STEPHANIE	He didn't want the money. He tried to give the money back.
M	RAY	In the end, he took it, didn't he?
M	STEPHANIE	I guess so.
M	RAY	So this is him. Got a name?
M	STEPHANIE	Uh... just "Kitty" so far. She takes the cat from Ray, cuddles it.
M	RAY	Sure you don't want me to spend the night?
M	STEPHANIE	Don't tempt me. I've got to prep a presentation for the morning.
M	RAY	okay. Ray kisses her, opens the front door and exits. He calls back
M	RAY	Remember, dinner at my folk's house, tomorrow night. We're supposed to bring desert. I could pick something up?
M	STEPHANIE	No. I'm planning on baking my special cake. Sounds good. Try not to stay up too late. Ray waves and steps into his car. Stephanie watches him drive
M	STEPHANIE	Isn't he adorable?
M	ELLEN	Let's hope the landlord thinks so. She sets down,the kitten and picks up her overnight bag. 0 What about you? You going to be okay? You know, I don't have to go out tonight.
M	STEPHANIE	No, I'm fine. Have a good time.
M	ELLEN	Do I look great? Be honest.
M	STEPHANIE.	You look great. Ellen smiles, grabs her car keys and heads for the door.
M	STEPHANIE	But... Isn't that Marci's dress?
M	ELLEN	Yeah. And if she calls, tell her not to go bi-polar on me, I'll'get it back to her by tomorrow. Or the next day. Bye! Ellen exits. Stephanie places butter into a mixer for the cake frosting. She moves to the front door. Locks it. Suddenly, the latch gives way and the windows swing open! The wind dies. The room grows eerily quiet. Sensing something, the Kitten arches it's back. Now Stephanie The floorboards CREAK. Something is walking towards her. She She backs against the wall, trembling. She runs for the door. She's almost there. Her hand reaches
M	WINDOW:	In the reflection, as the light bulb flickers, we see a flash
M	STEPHANIE	Get off me! Get off! The phantom hands vanish. Stephanie looks about, eyes wild. Stephanie is wearing Ray's overcoat atop her pajamas. She
M	RAY	So she came to your house? This is crazy. I'm calling that police officer. He begins to dial but Stephanie stops him.
M	STEPHANIE	Ray, you're not listening. It wasn't her. It was something that she sicked on me...
M	RAY	I don't understand.
M	STEPHANIE	I didn't tell you the whole story. That old woman... after she knocked me down, and pulled the button from my coat, she told me that...
M	RAY	What?
M	STEPHANIE	She said that something was coming for me... and it did. Ray stares at her with concern.
M	DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ	Ray, you were right to call me. Never a good idea to be personally involved with your patient.
M	RAY	What do you think?
M	DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ	1b Medically, she's fine. She's just very distraught. She's displaying some paranoia and a sense of panic. Classic symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder. Probably a result of being assaulted by that old woman. Doctor Rangavertz scribbles out a prescription and hands it
M	RAY	How worried should I be?
M	DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ	We'll have to wait and see.
M	RAY	How you doing?
M	STEPHANIE	Better now. At the time it just seemed so real. I'm so embarrassed.
M	RAY	Don't be, you had a terrible day and you.got a little wigged out. It happens.
M	STEPHANIE	po, what now, Doc?
M	RAY	I was gonna surprise you, but what the hell. I've been planning a little trip for us this week end. Saturday morning we're taking a train to Santa Barbara.
M	STEPHANIE	Really?
M	RAY	My family owns a cabin up there. In, the hills. Overlooking this little river. We'll light a fire, drink some champagne and screw our brains out.
M	STEPHANIE	You sure know how to talk to a girl.
M	RAY	It's a chance to just be together. Undisturbed. There's a lot of stuff I want to talk to you abqut but it never seems to be the right time.
M	STEPHANIE	Sounds nice. She draws in a deep breath and for the first time that WITHERED HANDS clamp around Stephanie's throat, violently
M	MRS GANUSH	You shamed mel Ray SHAKING her!
M	RAY	Steph! Wake Upl She awakens in her bed, SCREAMING!
M	STEPHANIE	Oh my God: Oh Godl
M	RAY	It was just a dream. It's okay. She gets control. Ray smooths out the tangled hair from her
M	STEPHANIE	Go ahead.
M	RAY	I'll be right back. He steps into the next room and we hear him answer the phone.
M	SHRIEKS!	The Old Woman opens her maw, exposing sharp broken teeth. She Stephanie grabs the old woman by her hair, halting the But the Old Woman's yellowed teeth SNAP and press ever The muscles in Stephanie's arms are trembling. She is Stephanie suddenly awakens with a GASP. It was all a dream She bolts up out of bed. Takes her bearings. She's alone in Ray enters.
M	RAY	You, okay?
M	STEPHANIE	No. No-- Oh my God. I had some 4 dreams. Awful.
M	RAY	Want to tell me about them?
M	STEPHANIE	The old lady. She was here... I couldn't wake up. Stephanie shakes her head. She can't finish.
M	RAY	Doctor Rangervertz said you could stop by his office during your lunch hour. Stephanie nods.
M	RAY	I had them replace the window last night. Still needs some body work.
M	STEPHANIE-	Thank you, Ray. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.
M	RAY	We've got to be prepared that it might take some time for you to get over this. She nods. Stephanie enters the bank. She guilty glancep to the clock. Mr. Jacks glances up and notes Stephanie's tardiness.
M	STU RUBIN	Hi Steph. Just getting here?
M	STEPHANIE	What are you, the hall monitor?
M	STU RUBIN	Ha ha! You're funny, Steph.
M	STEPHANIE	What do you want?
M	STU RUBIN	I need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures.
M	STEPHANIE	I've got a lot on my mind. Let's do it tomorrow.
M	STU RUBIN	Sure. I'll just tell Mr. Jacks that you don't have the time right now. Maybe he can show me. She glances up. Mr. Jacks'is still watching her.
M	STEPHANIE	No, no, that's all right. I'll do it. Where were we?
M	STU RUBIN	We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines.
M	STEPHANIE	Right. Okay. Let's say your client is a company that can't get traditional bank financing but 10 needs a secured loan. We offer-- Stephanie looks around for the source of the sound, but can't
M	STU	Yeah?
M	STEPHANIE	.uh, we offer several types of asset-based lending which consist of revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivables, their inventory, machinery-- , Stephanie sees... That Stu's hand has been replaced by MRS. GANUSH'S... it's
M	STU	---and?
M	STEPHANIE	--And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk! Stu is taken aback by Stephanie's outburst. He retreats to Stephanie sits, rattled. A drop of blood falls onto a piece
F	MR. JACKS	Stephanie? Where are you going? She moves quickly out the door, pretending not to hear him. Stu watches Stephanie go and gets up from his desk. She's Stephanie's car pulls up. she steps out, carrying Mrs. She passes the MOVING MEN who load the last of Mrs. Ganush's She arrives at the opened front door, gathers her courage and
M	STEPHANIE	Mrs. Ganush? No answer. She steps inside.
M	STEPHANIE	Mrs. Ganush? ' She moves forward into the living room.
F	MRS. GANUSH	I knew you'd come. Stephanie almost jumps out of her skin. As her eyes adjust
M	STEPHANIE	Hi. I'm here because I think I can help you. I can get your house back for you.
F	MRS. GANUSH	It's so empty now.
M	STEPHANIE .	I can arrange for all your furniture to be brought back. Would that be okay? Mrs Ganush does not look up from the photograph.
M	STEPHANIE	So... on behalf of the bank I just want to resolve this to your satisfaction. This whole thing got personal and there was really no reason for that. The bank made a mistake and I can fix it for you and in return I'd like you to- cancel or call off, whatever you... you know-- that thing you did to me. Okay? No hard feelings. So...
M	STEPHANIE	My mother was a proud woman. Dignity. That's what she had. Stephanie nods. Waits an appropriate moment, then: places the
M	STEPHANIE	All you need to do is. sign here... Stephanie offers her a pen.
M	STEPHANIE	.and I'll take care of the rest. Mrs. Ganush's hard eyes find Stephanie's. They bore in.
F	MRS. GANUSH	No. No? But... I'm saying I'll make things right. Just sign this and you can keep the house. Isn't that what you wanted?
F	MRS. GANUSH	It was what I wanted before you shamed me. Now I want to see you suffer.
M	STEPHANIE	Please! I've suffered enough!
M	MRS GANUSH	Not yet! Mrs. Ganush suddenly erupts in a broken toothed CACKLE.
M	STEPHANIE	You're insane! Just... just a crazy old woman! I don't even know why I came here!
M	1 MRS. GANUSH	You know why. Terrified, Stephanie runs from the place. Stephanie halts at a red light. out of the corner of her eye
M	STEPHANIE'S POV - ON THE STREET	
M	STEPHANIE	Stu? The men warmly escort into the First National Bank. What's he doing at First National? The car behind her HONKS! She drives on. She signs the receipt. He motions for her to follow him
M	RHAM JAS	What did it sound like.
M	STEPHANIE	Like... shrieking. It was awful. He nods. Closes the book.
M	RHAM JAS	That would be the Lamia. The "Black Goat".
M	STEPHANIE	Lamia. Right. That's the word the old woman used.
M	RHAM JAS	It is a nasty spirit. A taker of souls. A creature of misfortune for you and those around you. It is often summoned by the Gypsies for their dour deeds. On the third day the Lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object.
M	STEPHANIE	Accursed object? What object?
M	RHAM JAS	Something that the old woman took from you, cursed, then gave back. Now it dawns on Stephanie. She looks to the threads on her
M	STEPHANIE	The button...
M	STEPHANIE	.this? She holds the button up for him to inspect. But it's presence
M	STEPHANIE	What if I just burn the thing?
M	RHAM JAS	No matter what condition the button is in, you would still be the owner. The Lamia would still come to take you.
M	STEPHANIE	Take me where? Rham Jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text. She
M	STEPHANIE	There's got to be something I can do.
M	RHAM JAS	Yes. There are many ways to appease a spirit. The simplest is a blood offering. An animal sacrifice. A small creature would do. You could sacrifice a chicken. It's all in here... Rham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he
M	STEPHANIE	No way. I'm a vegetarian. I'm a member of PETA, for Christ's sake. I don't go around killing animals.
M	RHAM JAS	You will be surprised what you will be willing to do when the Lamia comes for you. She considers his words, looks down to the book. CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her Stephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing She hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside. She moves to She moves to the front door and puts her ear to it. Quiet. She runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door. For a moment all is quiet. Should she go back down? Then she
M	STEPHANIE	Ellen? ! But it's not Ellen. Stephanie puts her,ear to the door. The sound of an animal's Stephanie holds her breath, listening.
M	STEPHANIE	I know that you're there! The window behind her explodes into the room with a deafening
M	ROAR!	She ducks for cover. Another window is blown inward and the She tries to run but they tangle around her legs and yank her
M	STEPHANIE	Here kitty-kitty... Here, kitty- kitty-kitty... She moves closer until her face fills the screen.
M	STEPHANIE'S BACKYARD GARDEN AFTERNOON	She buries the heart in a corner of her garden.
M	ELLEN'S VOICE	Steph? Stephanie quickly tosses the knife into the bushes. Ellen
M	ELLEN	t Didn't you hear me calling? I was looking all over for you. Are you power eating Clark bars again? 'Cause there's about ten thousand wrappers all over the-- Oh my God, is that blood?1 Stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden. But
M	STEPHANIE	No. Why would there be blood?
M	ELLEN	Right there, on your sleeve. Stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve.
M	STEPHANIE	That's just tomato juice. I was inside making a salad and... I cut a tomato and I must have gotten it on my sleeve. Ellen gives her roommate a worried look.
M	ELLEN	Look, Steph, we're friends so if something's wrong...
M	STEPHANIE	I had some problems. A situation. But I think everything is going to be good now. Ellen isn't so sure. Stephanie looks distastefully down at her former self. She
M	ELLEN	Go with the short skirt.
M	STEPHANIE	What about this one? She hold up a longer, more formal dress.
M	ELLEN	Uh uh. That one's saying "I'm trying to impress you with my conservative taste."
M	STEPHANIE	But that's what I want it to say. Ellen shakes her head, no. Stephanie takes a last look in the
M	STEPHANIE	Okay. This is it.
M	ELLEN	Tell me again... the exact words he used.
M	STEPHANIE	Just that this little cabin would be a great place for us to really connect and that there was something he'd been meaning to talk about with me.
M	ELLEN	Oh my god, you are so engaged! Ellen's smile fades. She shakes her head despondently.
M	STEPHANIE	What's wrong? I
M	ELLEN	t I just know that Rob's never going to ask me.
M	STEPHANIE	But I thought you said that relationship was only physical.
M	ELLEN	Oh, I'd never marry a guy like that... but I'd still like him to ask me.
M	STEPHANIE	Huh.
M	RAY'S VOICE	Let's get a look at that dress. She steps from the car and models the dress. S
M	STEPHANIE	You like
M	RAY	I like.
M	RAY AND STEPHANIE	drive through the streets of Bel Air, Stephanie at the wheel. She hits the gas and her Ford Focus opens up, accelerating
M	RAY	Something wrong?
M	STEPHANIE	It's just that I'm not, some ivy leaguer with an impressive resume. I have a feeling that's what your folks really want.
M	RAY	Maybe. But in the end, it's about what you and I want.
M	STEPHANIE	Is that so? Ray gives her a reassuring nod. The front door opens revealing Ray's parents, GEORGE AND
M	RAYMONDL	She kisses her son.
M	RAY	Stephanie, this is my mother, Trudy, and my Father, George. Trudy glances at Stephanie's revealing cocktail dress with
F	TRUDY	How do you do?
M	GEORGE	Nice tp meet you, Stephanie.
M	STEPHANIE	It's very nice to meet you, too.
M	GEORGE	Please, come in.
M	STEPHANIE	Thank you. She steps inside.
M	STEPHANIE	You have a lovely home.
M	GEORGE	Thanks. I'll get us something to drink. As George exits, Stephanie presents her home made cake to
M	STEPHANIE	I hope you don't mind. I baked something for you. Trudy hesitates, then takes the cake from Stephanie.
F	TRUDY	It's lovely. Homemade.
M	STEPHANIE	It's a harvest cake.
F	TRUDY	Harvest cake? Is'that some kind of cake you make on a... farm?
M	STEPHANIE	We used to, yeah, when you have a lot of extra duck eggs. Especially right before spring; that's when you get a real dense yolk. Makes for, rich cake. The mother forces a smile.
F	TRUDY	You must give me the recipe sometime.
M	STEPHANIE	Sure. It's easy. The real secret's in the milk. You want it unpasteurized.
F	TRUDY	Unclean... Uh... I mean "unpasteurized"? Is that safe?
M	STEPHANIE	Uh huh. And you want that milk still warm. Straight from the cow. Trudy has to stifle her gag reflex. George returns and hands
F	TRUDY	Excuse me while I go find someplace to put this. As Trudy takes away the cake, a cat rounds the corner. It
M	GEORGE	Never could understand that damned animal. Hate cats. Trudy returns from the kitchen.
F	TRUDY	That's strange. Hecuba's usually very sweet.
M	STEPHANIE	That's okay. I had a cat. I understand.
M	RAY	What do you mean "had a cat"? What happened to him?
M	STEPHANIE	How would I know what happened? Probably nothing. You know how cats are. They come and they go. Ray nods slowly. About to say something but let's it go.
M	GEORGE	Still keeping up with your coin collection, Ray?
M	RAY	I try to. In fact Stephanie just found me a 1925 Indian Head nickel at her bank.
M	GEORGE	Really? So, how long have you been working there, Stephanie?
M	STEPHANIE	Almost two years now.
F	TRUDY	The job of a bank teller must be so difficult. I'd think with all the counting and the repetition, it'd become so tedious.
M	STEPHANIE	Yes, you're right. But I'm not a teller.
F	TRUDY	Oh?
M	RAY	Stephanie's a loan officer in charge of small business and home loans. And she's on a fast track for a promotion. Right, Steph?
M	STEPHANIE	I'd like to think so... actually, It depends. If I could close this big account that I'm working on, it would really help.
M	GEORGE	Must be a very important loan.
M	STEPHANIE	It would be the biggest that my branch has ever handled.
M	GEORGE	How''d it come to you?
M	STEPHANIE	Well, I was reading the Wall Street Journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was interested in expanding but didn't have the liquidity. I met with their CFO and presented a formula for restructuring-some of their long term debt. It created an environment where I was able to offer them a rather attractive loan
M	GEORGE	You sure sound like you've got a lot going for you, Stephanie.
F	TRUDY	Your mother must be very proud.
M	STEPHANIE	I suppose. I don't see her much.
F	TRUDY	Why is that?
M	STEPHANIE	Well, ever since my dad died she doesn't talk much. She mostly stays on the farm and... keeps to herself. Because... There is an awkward silence.
F	TRUDY	Does your mother have a drinking problem?
M	RAY	Cut her some slack, mom, she--
M	STEPHANIE	Yes. I'm afraid she does.
F	TRUDY	I'm sorry. It's nothing to be ashamed of. And I find your honesty refreshing.
M	STEPHANIE	Thank you.
F	TRUDY	t You've got back bone. Not like that other girl Ray brought by... What was her name? Alicia? She was dreadful. So ill-mannered. And no ambition.
F	TRUDY	He found her through the,internet.
M	RAY	Mors, please.
F	TRUDY	Stephanie, am I being too tough on Ray? Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at
M	STEPHANIE	No. Not at all. That's what mom's are for.
F	TRUDY	Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will try that Harvest cake of yours, after all. Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie tastes the cake and
M	STEPHANIE	Excuse me. She clears her throat. But the cough returns, grows larger.
M	STEPHANIE	Just a little tickle in my-- She stands and takes a few steps away from the table. Ray
M	RAY	Are you okay? She waves him off, clearing her throat. Tries to smile
F	TRUDY	Oh! OH MY GOD! The fly lazily BUZZES across the table, slowly circling Trudy spits out a mouthful of harvest cake into her napkin. Ray is baffled, too stunned to speak.
M	RAY	I'm so sorry, Stephanie. I don't know how that fly got. into your--
M	STEPHANIE	--Wait. What's that sound?
F	TRUDY	What sound-?
M	STEPHANIE	SHHH! Listen! Trudy listens along with the others. They can't hear
F	TRUDY	I'm sorry, I can't hear anything.
M	STEPHANIE	Must be deafer than a post! But Trudy heard that and takes offense. But before she can Leave me alone! Just leave me the fuck alone! Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past Ray rushes to her side.
M	RAY	Steph, it's okay! There's nothing there. She looks about. George and Trudy regard Stephanie as if she
M	STEPHANIE	I... I think I'd better go.
F	TRUDY	I think that's best, dear. She heads for the door. Ray starts to go after her but his
F	TRUDY	Let her go, Ray. She's a sick girl.
M	RAY	She needs me. Trudy grabs Ray's arm.
F	TRUDY	I'm telling you not to go after her. Ray gently pulls free of his mother's grasp and chases after What did you see in there? You don't want to know. Ray pulls her close.
M	RAY	Tell me!
M	STEPHANIE	The thing that's coming for me. What the old woman sent.
M	RAY	Listen to me. What you're going through right now-- It's like the doctor said, it's a stress reaction and --
M	STEPHANIE	No. I wanted to believe that-- but it's real, Ray. You just don't want to open your eyes to it because it threatens you. Because if I'm right and there is something out there, then you'd have to throw out everything you teach. And where'd that leave you? Like a plow without a mule. Ray just stares at her. A long moment passes as he wonders if
M	STEPHANIE	Unless you're willing to take a chance and believe in me, I can't be with you any more. She steps into the car and drives off. Ray watches her tail She turns toward a distant sound: A chilling, high-pitched
M	VOICE OF THE EYE	What is it?
M	STEPHANIE	Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia Ganush. Is she here? The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old
M	ILENKA	I'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter. Who are you?
M	STEPHANIE	Stephanie Brown. I'm... sort of... a friend of hers. Actually, I've been trying to help her with a loan
M	ILENKA	Wait. I know who you are. Grandma told me you'd come. You're the woman from the bank. The one who took her house.
M	STEPHANIE	It was really the bank that took the house. I just work there. In fact, I tried to help your grandma get-the house back, but my boss wouldn't let me. Ilenka knows she's lying. Stephanie knows that she knows.
M	ILENKA	That's not what happened, is it? Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face?
M	STEPHANIE	. no.
M	ILENKA	You used to be a real fat girl, to didn't you?
M	STEPHANIE	Yes.
M	ILENKA	I can tell. You know, you caused my grandma a lot of pain. That house was her pride. When you took that from her, she had nothing left. You're not welcome here. She starts to close the door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate
M	STEPHANIE	Okay! I did it. It was me who denied her the loan. I was trying, to get ahead at work and I shouldn't have done it. It was wrong.
M	ILENKA	Damn straight it was wrong.
M	STEPHANIE	And I'm ashamed about it. And I'm going to get down on my hands and knees and beg her to forgive me. She said-that I hadn't suffered enough. But now I think she'll see that I have and then maybe she'll let me...
M	ILENKA	.make everything all right for her, is that it?
M	STEPHANIE	Yes. Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic smile. She motions for A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice. A
M	' STEPHANIE	Where is she? Ilenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers. Stephanie As per the custom of the Gypsy wake, there is no coffin, just The dead woman's opened mouth bobs up and down upon
M	ILENKA	Still going to make everything all right? The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table.
M	STEPHANIE	No, please-- I needed her to take this thing off me.
M	ILENKA	It will never come off.
M	STEPHANIE	You know about it? Then, please help me. I'm begging you.
M	ILENKA	She said you'd come begging. I only wish she could have lived to see it. The blood drains from Stephanie's face.
M	ILENKA	.maybe she can... Stephanie glances down to the corpse. It's head is now
M	STEPHANIE	Fuck that! I paid you a hundred and seventy nine dollars for that book!
M	RHAM JAS	It was a limited printing! Please control yourself!
M	STEPHANIE	I did what you said- that blood offering... I killed that little kitty deader than Hogan's goat. Lotta good that did me.
M	RHAM JAS	We are dealing with elusive and powerful forces. There are no guarantees. She wants to shout, but instead, closes her eyes and sits.
M	STEPHANIE	Just tell me what to do. Rham Jas considers. A dark look crosses his face. Stephanie
M	CLOSE ON STEPHANIE'S MASTERCARD	It's run through the carbon paper. Rham Jas hand her a
M	RHAM JAS	We must somehow dissuade the spirit from taking your soul.
M	STEPHANIE	How?
M	RHAM JAS	1 A seance. And it should be soon. For tomorrow will be the third night...
M	STEPHANIE	Have you done this before?
M	RHAM JAS	No. But I know someone. I can arrange what is necessary, but you must understand that everyone involved in this would be taking a great risk with their lives.
M	STEPHANIE	What would you need from me? Rham Jas thinks for a moment, weighing the dangers. He pulls
M	RHAM JAS	Twenty thousand dollars. Cash. By tomorrow. 5
M	ELLEN	I need to talk to you.
M	STEPHANIE	Ellen. I'm sorry. This a bad time right now. I got a little emergency and... say you got any cash I can borrow? She starts stuffing the valuables into a large duffle bag.
M	ELLEN	No, I don't. But Steph I--
M	STEPHANIE	--what about your credit cards? What's your cash advance limit? I'll pay you back. You know I'm good for it.
M	ELLEN	Steph, we need to talk about the cat.
M	STEPHANIE	Where has that little rascal been? He's always running off, have you noticed that?
M	ELLEN	Stephanie. I was in the back yard and I saw where the ground was dug up. I started digging and... You buried that little kitty in our backyard. What happened?
M	STEPHANIE	I didn't want to tell you. It fell out the window and died. It's sad,
M	ELLEN	I found the bloody knife in the bushes.
M	STEPHANIE	What are you, a cat detective?
M	ELLEN	Steph? I'm going to tell you this as your friend. There is something seriously wrong with you. Stephanie looks up from,her frantic panting.
M	STEPHANIE	Uh... Duhi
M	ELLEN	I'm moving out. I can't live like this.
M	STEPHANIE.	Fine. Ellen exits. Stephanie angrily calls after her:
M	STEPHANIE	An' don't let the barn door hit you on your ass on yer way out!
M	STEPHANIE	I can't get the twenty thousand. You're gonna have to help me with what I've got.
M	RHAM JAS' VOICE	What do you have? She covers the mouthpiece, speaking to someone off camera.
M	STEPHANIE	How much?! CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that we are'in a PAWN SHOP. Men
M	PAWN BROKER	Thirty-eight hundred for everything.
M	STEPHANIE	Including my jewlery?
M	PAWN BROKER	Including. Stephanie curses under her breath, checks the balance on her
M	STEPHANIE	Six thousand.
M	RHAM JAS	I'm sorry. Not possible.
M	STEPHANIE	Look, I'll give you six now and--
M	RHAM JAS	No. There will be others involved and I cannot-ask them to accept such a risk for less. Good night. He hangs up. The line goes dead. She tries to throw the phone
M	STEPHANIE	I'll take it! Stephanie thinks about how she'll get the extra cash. She The younger, obese Stephanie and her stern looking Mother.
M	STEPHANIE	Mom? Hi, it's me. Did you get,the Christmas card? Yeah, I guess it has been a while. Listen, I'm in kind of a fix, here. I've been pretty sick and I need to borrow some money for an operation. I need fourteen thousand dollars right away. Now I know you still have that pension fund at the credit Union so-- yeah, but... okay. Okay, it's just that--- I understand. Okay, mom. Bye. The line goes dead. She slumps down against the pay phone.
M	CLOSE SHOT - STEPHANIE	She pouts her lips in the mirror, carefully applying
M	PULL BACK	To reveal we are in the employee bathroom at the bank. She
M	STEPHANIE	Mr. Jacks, this is kind of awkward for me... I know it's not official yet, but I was wondering if I could get a copy of the employment contract for the new position you offered me?
F	MR. JACKS	The assistant manager's position?
M	STEPHANIE	Yes. See, one of my family members is having a little emergency which requires me to get them an immediate loan--
F	MR. JACKS	--Stephanie... There's a problem. The McPherson deal was cancelled last night.
M	STEPHANIE	What? 1
F	MR. JACKS	Yeah, right after I informed the main branch that we had this big loan pending,,I find out that they just made their deal over at First National. I got a call in to see, what exactly happened but right now this doesn't look too good for you or me. So this assistant manager promotion has been delayed. In fact, I think that with everything that's been happening, I'm gonna have to give that job to Stu. Stephanie is devastated.
M	STEPHANIE	Stu. I see. Mr. Jacks sees tears begin to well up in her eyes.
F	MR. JACKS	I'm sorry. Look. If you've got family problems. Maybe you should take the day off and sort them out. Stephanie node and exits the bank. As it TICKS away the seconds. CLOSE SHOT - THE Inadequate PILE OF CASH That site atop Stephanie's Kitchen table.
M	RAY.	I paid Rham Jas
M	STEPHAINE	But I thought you didn't believe...
M	RAY'	I don't. But you do. I know this is important for, you . she embraces him.
M	STEPHANIE	Are you coming in? I wanted to but Rham Jas said non believers weren't welcome. I still don't like this.
M	STEPHANIE	I know how crazy this must seem. But it will all be over after this I swear to you. He nods. She kisses him.
M	STEPHANIE	I'll call you when it's done.
M	RAY	I'll be waiting.
M	STEPHANIE	We'll laugh about it on the train, tomorrow.
M	RAY	t Yeah. Stephanie steps from the car. Ray drives off. She turns to
M	RHAM JAS	Miss Brown. Allow me the pleasure of an introduction... A woman rises from the shadows.
M	RHAM JAS	.Shaun San Dena The eighty year old woman smiles a toothless smile to
M	RHAM JAS	Shaun San Dena is an experienced 41 medium. Furthermore, she has a personal knowledge of the Lamia.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	I first encountered this spirit forty years ago in a small village outside of Bucharest.
M	STEPHANIE	And...?
M	SHUAN SAN DENA	I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.
M	STEPHANIE	That's reassuring.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	I was an. inexperienced seer then. I've learned much since that woeful day. I have waited these long years for a chance at redeeming myself. A chance to destroy the foul thing. Tonight my chance will come. But to summon it, I will need your help.
M	STEPHANIE	I'll do whatever it takes. And the sooner the better.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	Our business must wait till darkness falls. Enough time for tea.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	My late husband, Sandor, was also a medium. He chose this site to build the'house upon because he sensed certain energies that intersected here... He knew I would sense his spirit in this place as I have sensed others. It was to be our way of being together after he died. In earlier times it was a sacred place to the Tuanteteck indians. And their stories told that the place was a burial ground of the "old ones" that inhabited the earth before them. Here, there is a particular alignment of energies. A confluence, that allows doorways to be opened. Through which, we might pass.
M	RHAM JAS '	And through which, others might pass into our world. Milos removes the tea.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	It is time for us to begin. Shaun San Dena turns out the electric lights, leaving only
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	Lord Jesus bless this knife and allow it to do your holy work. She makes the sign of the cross. she pours a .vial of holy
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	Once the spirit has entered me, place my hand upon the animal. Do you understand?
M	STEPHANIE	Yes.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	I will force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat. Milos, that's when you strike. Stephanie blanches but remains silent.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	We must all.be receptive. Shaun San Dena begins to intone a Romanian Gypsy chant.
M	STEPHANIE	What do I have to do?
M	RHAM JAS	You must allow the darkness in. You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit..
M	STEPHANIE	I'm scared.
M	RHAM JAS	Yes. Now repeat these words... I welcome the dead into my soul... Rham Jae waits for Stephanie's response. She's shifts in her
M	STEPHANIE	I welcome the dead into my soul...
M	RHAM JAS	You must believe it! Stephanie takes a deep breath and they begin the chant again.
M	RAM JAAS STEPHANIE	I welcome the dead into my I welcome the dead into my soul... soul... Stephanie looks around the darkened room. Shadows from the
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	I sense something here with us.
M	RHAM JAS	Yes. The parlor's crystal chandeleir tinkles. A tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment. Stephanie's eyes

M	SHAUN SAN DENA	Be gone, foolish spirit! There is a HOWLING OF WIND and the room is again quiet.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	Show yourself Lamia. We invite you into our circle. Quiet. Stephanie looks about. Nothing seems to be happening.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	He's coming... A faint sound. The SCRATCHING OF FINGERNAILS on wood. A sound that
M	SCRATCH SCRATCH!	Stephanie grips the table. And just when the SCRATCHING SOUND is deafening... All Stephanie holds her breath. A wind whips up in the room sending papers whirling about,. Shaun San Dena's eyes roll up into her head. She emits a low
M	RHAM JAS	Who now inhabits the body of Shaun San Dena?
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	Lamia... Rham Jas nods discreetly to Milos who quietly uncovers the
M	RHAM JAS.	Lamia, what is it that you desire? Shaun San Dena's chair abruptly spins about to face
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	The soul of Stephanie Brownl We will feast upon it, as she festers in the gravel
M	STEPHANIE	It was my manager, Jim Jacks. He was the one ! He--
M	RHAM JAS	Silence! Lamia, please, surely we can dissuade you from taking this insignificant woman? Surely she's not worthy of your greatness. The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs.
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	No! I will enjoy watching her skin blister and pop in hell's flame. I come for her! Stephanie quickly grabs Shaun San Derna's hand and places it Shaun San Dena's eyes clear for a moment as she struggles to Now there are two spirits battling within her. She attempts
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	No! You--

Rham Jas rouses a stunned Shaun San Dena.
M	RHAM JAS	You must banish the spirit! Shaun San Dena places her hands on her ayes, then over her Milos SHRIEKS. A white vapor streams from his body as the
M	MILOS	Stop the chanting. I beg you! But Shaun San Dena only chants louder. Milos SCREAMS grow
M	STEPHANIE	For god's sake, stop the chanting, it's killing him! Rham Jas pushes her aside.
M	RHAM JAS	You must not stop! A withered pair of hands reach down from above and clutch at
M	MILOS/MRS. GANUSH	Make her stop, you dirty pork queen!
M	STEPHANIE	No! Get her off! Mrs. Ganush grabs at Stephanie's head. Stephanie pulls away Mrs. Ganush opens her mouth... wide... wider still... she Shaun San Dena, is trembling as her chanting comes to a Mrs. Ganush changes back to the possessed Milo. The last of

M	STEPHANIE	Let me help you...
M	SHAUN SAN DENA	My heart. Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanie's arms. Rham Jas
M	RHAM JAS	Milos, call an ambulance! Milos rushes from the room to call for help... Rham Jas
M	RHAM JAS	She's not breathing. Rham Jas attempts to administer CPR to no avail.
M	STEPHANIE	My God. My God... He checks her pulse one last time. The CPR is finally halted.
M	RHAM JAS	Gata, gata, para gata... bodhi suaha. Gone, gone, gone beyond. Gone beyond the beyond. Hail the goer.
M	STEPHANIE	It's sad:
M	RHAM JAS	Yes.
M	STEPHANIE	Strange how things work out. She waited years for another chance to overcome the lamia ..and finally she did.
