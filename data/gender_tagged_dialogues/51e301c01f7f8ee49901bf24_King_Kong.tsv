M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ANNY	That's a funny one! Isn't that funnier?
M	HARRY	It's hysterical, Manny. As long as we're laughing we won't be crying over the box office. Talk about depressing.
F	ANN	Twenty girls in feather boas prancing around like circus ponies! That's depressing!
M	MAUDE	I love a good chorus line!
M	TAPS	What's this?
F	ANN	It's a play.
M	MANNY	Who wrote it, Annie?
M	TAPS	Some guy - Driscoll. From the Federal Theatre.
M	AUDE	Don't knock it, honey - at least they get an audience.
F	ANN	It'll pick up .... Ain't that right, Manny? It always does.
M	MANNY	The trick is to start the build right at the back of your throat... Works well out through the nose too.
F	ANN	Have you eaten today?
M	MANNY	Oh, I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me. Hey - you're all I've got. Come on - take me to dinner.
M	MANNY	You think the kitchen'll still be open on Third?
F	ANN	Soup and biscuits - perfect.
F	ANN	Hey! Harry, what's going on? Hey, open up! We work here.
M	LADDER MAN	Not anymore.
M	MAUDE	It's all right for you! We haven't had a pay check in two weeks - how we going to eat?
F	ANN	They're not going to get away with this.
M	AUDE	They just did. Ann ... Annie! It's no use. The show it's over - it's done. 'm done. I'm leaving, Annie ... I'm going back to Chicago. I'm sorry ... I'm sorry, Ann. Ever since you were small people have been letting you down. But you gotta think of yourself now. You should try out for that part. It's what you've always wanted. Oh, I know what you're thinking - every time you reach out for something you care about ... fate comes along and snatches it away. But not this time, Annie ... not this time.
F	ANN	Oh, hello Mr. Weston?!
M	WESTON	Oh, Jeez ...
M	WESTON (cont'd)	Look, Miss ... I told you already; call my office - leave your resume with my secretary.
F	ANN	Why would I want to do that when we can talk about it in person?
M	WESTON	Because that's what a smart girl would do.
F	ANN	But I already sent you my resume - you returned it unopened.
M	WESTON	What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very particular about who he works with.
F	ANN	Please, just an audition - that's all I'm asking.
M	WESTON	esus - you don't give up, do you?
F	ANN	Mr. Weston, I know this role backwards.
M	ESTON	ell, that's too bad - because we just gave the part to someone else. Sorry, kid - the play is cast.
M	WESTON (cont'd)	Look - I know times are tough. You want my advice? Use what you got. You're not bad looking - a girl like you doesn't have to starve. There's a new place, just opened. Listen, princess - this gig ain't the Palace, you understand? Ask for Kenny K. Tell him I sent you.
M	ESTON (cont'd)	Just play the date, take the money and forget you was ever there. above a CLAPPER BOARD ... "TAKE 5"
M	ZELMAN	How much more is there?
M	ASSISTANT	Another five reels.
M	ZELMAN	Lights up.
M	THUGGISH INVESTOR	This is it? This is what we get for our forty grand, Denham? Another one of your Safari pictures?
M	LEAZY INVESTOR	You promised us romantic scenes with Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie.
M	DENHAM	Come on, fellas - you know the deal - we agreed to push Maureen's start date so she could get her teeth fixed.
M	THUGGISH INVESTOR	It's not the principle of the thing - it's the money.
M	ELMAN	Carl - you've been in production for over two months -
M	DENHAM	Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna steam up the screen - once we get them on the ship. Z ELMAN What ship?
M	DENHAM	The one we've hired to get to the location.
M	ZELMAN	What location? Carl - you're supposed to be shooting on the back-lot.
M	DENHAM	Yes, I understand that - but fellas, we're not making that film anymore - and I'll tell you why.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	The story has changed, the script has been rewritten.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Life intervened! I've come into possession of a map. The soul surviving record of an unchartered island, a place that was thought to exist only in myth ... until now!
M	ZELMAN	Whoa! Carl - slow down!
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR	Is he askin' for more money?
M	THUGISH INVESTOR	He's asking us to fund a wild goose- chase.
M	DENHAM	I'm talking about a primitive world ... never before seen by man! The ruins of an entire civilisation - the most spectacular thing you've ever seen! That's where I'll shoot my picture!
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR	Will there be boobies?
M	DENHAM	Excuse me, boobies?
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR	Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ... In my experience people only go to these films to observe the ... undraped form of the native girls.
M	DENHAM	What are you - an idiot? You think they asked De Mille to waste his time on nudie shots? No - they respected the film maker, they showed some class! Not that you'd know what that means - you cheap low-life!
M	ZELMAN	Would you step outside for a moment, Carl?
M	DENHAM	Gimme that - quick!
M	PRESTON	You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!
M	DENHAM	Preston, you have a lot to learn about the motion picture business.
M	ZELMAN	Don't write him off fellas. He's hot- headed sure, but Carl Denham's made some interesting pictures, he's had a lot of ... near success.
M	THUGGISH INVESTOR	He's a preening self promoter ...
M	THUGGISH INVESTOR (O.S.)	... an ambitious no-talent! The guy has "loser" written all over him.
M	ELMAN (O.S.)	Look, I understand your disappointment. He's washed up - It's all over town!
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR (O.S.)	He can't direct. He doesn't have the smarts.
M	THUGGISH INVESTOR	This jumped up little turd's gonna bankrupt us.
M	ZELMAN	The animal footage has value?
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR	Sure ... Universal are desperate for stock footage.
M	THUGGISH INVESTOR	Then sell it! Scrap the picture! We gotta retrieve something from this debacle. Z ELMAN nods ... gestures to the YOUNG ASSISTANT.
M	ZELMAN	Get him back in.
M	YOUNG ASSISTANT	Mr. Denham?
M	DENHAM	I want the cast and crew on the ship within the hour.
M	RESTON	o Carl, you can't do this!
M	DENHAM	Tell `em the studio's pressured us into an early departure.
M	PRESTON	It's not ethical!
M	DENHAM	hat are they gonna do - sue me? They can get in line! I'm not going to let them kill my film.
M	RESTON	ou realize none of the camera equipment is on board. We have no permits ... no visas ...
M	DENHAM	hat's why I have you, Preston.
M	RESTON	We have no insurance, no foreign currency - in fact, we have no currency of any kind -
M	DENHAM	Get in there!
M	PRESTON	ho's gonna pay for the ship?
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR	Get out of there!
M	DENHAM	tep on it!
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR	You're finished, Denham!
M	DENHAM	on't worry Preston - I've had a lot of practice at this: I'm real good at crapping the crappers.
M	DENHAM	And two dozen of Mr. Walker's finest Red label, 80% proof - packed in a crate marked "lemonade".
M	DENHAM	You got it ... and tell Maureen - she doesn't have six hours to put on her face. If she wants to be in this picture, she's gotta be on that boat!
M	PRESTON	She doesn't want to be in this picture. P Maureen pulled out.
M	DENHAM	She pulled out?!
M	RESTON	Yesterday. I told you.
M	DENHAM	You said we were shooting in Singapore, right? That's what you told her?
M	PRESTON	But we're not shooting in Singapore.
M	DENHAM	Goddammit, Preston! All you had to do is look her in the eye and lie.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	I gotta get to a phone ... talk to Harlow's people.
M	PRESTON	he`s unavailable.
M	DENHAM (O.S.)	Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?
M	PRESTON	Mae West?! No! She has to be a size four!
M	PRESTON	ou gotta get a girl who'll fit Maureen's costumes.
M	DENHAM	Fay's a size four!
M	PRESTON	es she is, but she is doing a picture with RKO.
M	DENHAM	ooper huh? I might have known.
M	PRESTON	We gotta delay the shoot - shut production down ... We can't sail tonight!
M	DENHAM	Not an option.
M	RESTON	Carl!
M	DENHAM	I said I'd find a girl.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	For Godsake, Preston - think like a winner. Call Jack ... I need that Goddamn screenplay!
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Defeat is always momentary. W IDER: DENHAM is standing outside a tacky BURLESQUE THEATRE. He away from the THEATRE.
M	VENDOR	You gonna pay for this?
M	DENHAM (O.S.)	Excuse me ...
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Ma'am, I think you dropped this.
M	DENHAM	Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville once... that is a tough audience. If you don't kill them fast, they kill you.
F	ANN	Mr. Denham - I want you to know that I'm not in the habit of accepting charity from strangers, or for that matter ... taking things that don't belong to me. D DENHAM t was obviously a terrible misunderstanding.
F	ANN	It's just that, I haven't been paid in a while ...
M	DENHAM	That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call you Ann?
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	... You wouldn't happen to be a size four by any chance?
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	No! Oh God, no! You've got me all wrong. Miss Darrow, please! I'm not that type of person at all!
F	ANN	What type of person are you?
M	DENHAM	I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a movie producer. Believe me, I am on the level, no funny business. Please, sit down - Please ... Please.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Ann, I want you to imagine a handsome explorer bound for the Far East.
F	ANN	You're filming in the Far East?
M	DENHAM	Singapore. On board ship he meets a mysterious girl. She's beautiful ... she's fragile ... haunted ...
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	She can't escape the feeling that forces beyond her control are compelling her down a road from which she cannot draw back. It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment - this fateful meeting that changes everything. And sure enough, against her better judgement -
F	ANN	She falls in love.
M	DENHAM	Yes!
F	ANN	But she doesn't trust it. She's not even sure if she believes in love.
M	DENHAM	Oh really?
F	ANN	If she loves someone - it's doomed.
M	DENHAM	Why is that?
F	ANN	Good things never last, Mr. Denham.
M	DENHAM	So you're interested?
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	That's settled then. I don't want to rush you - but we are under some time pressure here.
F	ANN	Well I really -
M	DENHAM	Ann? I'm telling you, You're perfect - look at you! You're the saddest girl I ever met ... you're gonna make `em weep, Ann - you're gonna break their hearts!
F	ANN	See, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Denham, I make people laugh, that's what I do.
M	ANN (cont'd)	Good luck with your picture.
M	DENHAM	Ann! Miss Darrow! Please! DE you money, adventure, fame ... the thrill of a lifetime and a long sea voyage. You wanna read a script? Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft as we speak.
F	ANN	Jack Driscoll?
M	DENHAM	ure. Why - wait! You know him?
F	ANN	Well, no - not personally. I've seen his plays.
M	DENHAM	What a writer, huh? And let me tell you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want just anyone starring in this picture. He said to me, "Carl, somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role ..." And as soon as I saw you, I knew -
F	ANN	Knew what?
M	DENHAM	It was always going to be you.
F	ANN	Is this the moving picture ship?
M	DENHAM	Not exactly ... it's actually this one over here. Don't let appearances deceive you. It's much more spacious on board.
M	HAYES	Haul away ...
M	DENHAM	Is this all of the equipment? This is all of it? We're taking the Bell and Howell? Good. You got all the lenses - you got the two and the six?
M	PRESTON (O.S.)	Carl!
M	DENHAM	Get it on board, fellas. Come on. A NGLE ON: PRESTON hurrying down the GANGWAY. He rushes up to
M	PRESTON	They're on their way. I've just had word.
M	DENHAM	Who?
M	PRESTON	Men in uniform. The studio called the cops!
M	DENHAM	Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the mainsail - raise the anchor, whatever the hell it is you do - we gotta leave.
M	ENGLEHORN	I cannot do that ... we're waiting on the manifest.
M	DENHAM	What? Who? English - please!
M	ENGLEHORN	Paperwork, Mr. Denham.
M	DENHAM	I'll give you another thousand to leave right now.
M	ENGLEHORN	You haven't given me the first thousand yet.
M	DENHAM	Can we talk about this later. Can't you see we're in the company of a VIP guest?
M	ENGLEHORN	Ma'am...
F	ANN	Ann Darrow.
M	ENGLEHORN	So you are ready for this voyage, Miss Darrow?
F	ANN	Sure...
M	ENGLEHORN	Nervous?
F	ANN	Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?
M	ENGLEHORN	It isn't every woman who would take such a risk.
M	PRESTON	Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?
M	DENHAM	Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.
M	PRESTON	Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my name is Preston, Carl's assistant.
M	DENHAM	Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will you take a cheque?
M	ENGLEHORN	Do I have a choice? E
M	PRESTON	Please, follow me. If there's anything that you need ... `excuse me fellas, if there's anything that you need please don't hesitate to ... ask ...
M	DENHAM	Jesus, Jack - you scared me!
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Listen, if anyone comes to the door, don't open it. You haven't seen me ... say I got depressed and committed suicide. Say I stuck my head down a toilet! You want one?
M	JACK	No! I can't stay, Carl. I have a rehearsal for which I am now ... ... three hours late.
M	DENHAM	What's this?
M	JACK	It's the script.
M	DENHAM	This is a script? Jack ... this is fifteen pages.
M	ACK	I know - but they're good! You've got fifteen good pages there, Carl!
M	DENHAM	I'm supposed to be making a feature length picture.
M	JACK	You told me I had more time. I'm sorry. Look I gotta go.
M	DENHAM	Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I have a beginning but I need a middle and an end! I gotta have something to shoot.
M	JACK	You got my notes - I gotta go. See you.
M	DENHAM	Alright, fine. We might as well settle up.
M	JACK	You're going to pay me?
M	DENHAM	I'm not going to stiff a friend.
M	ACK	I've never known you to volunteer cash before ...
M	DENHAM	How does two grand sound?
M	JACK	Sounds great!
M	DENHAM	Thought it might.
M	D	Voila!
M	JACK	Thanks... Carl ... you've written "Two Grand".
M	DENHAM	So I did ... Sorry about that Let's start from the beginning.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	"Two Thousand Dollars" ...
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	It is the 29th, isn't it?
M	JACK	Come on - it's the 25th, Carl, the 25th!
M	DENHAM	I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just take a second.
M	JACK	Never mind, pay me when you get back!
M	DENHAM	Alright ... okay ...
M	PRESTON	Your cabin's just down here, Mr. Baxter. May I say how excited we are to have you back with us, Sir.
M	BRUCE	Be a sport and lend us a hand.
M	JACK	Oh, Christ!
M	BRUCE	Appreciate the help, fella.
M	PRESTON	Let me get the door for you - welcome to your state room sir.
M	RESTON	know, that's not a nice smell is it? I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or two. Did I ever mention how much I love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen every one of your pictures ... even the silent ones.
M	RUCE	I haven't made any silent ones.
M	ENGLEHORN	Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.
M	HAYES	Dead slow ahead both, Captain.
M	JACK	Oh Christ! Goddammit!
M	DENHAM	I keep telling you, Jack, there's no money in theatre.
M	SLEAZY INVESTOR	No, no, no!
M	DENHAM	You're much better off sticking with film.
M	JACK	I don't do it for the money, Carl. I happen to love the theatre.
M	DENHAM	o, you don't. If you really loved it, you would have jumped.
M	PRESTON	I hope you find it to your liking... it's quite comfortable. Your towels and linens are underneath the bed. That is the wash basin. I know, that's not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or two. The closet ... your costumes - I hope you'll find everything is in order. If there is anything that you need, please do not hesitate to ask...fresh water, perhaps? I can bring it to you personally.
M	DENHAM	Knock knock! We can't have our leading lady deprived of the necessities of Do me a favour - run a bottle down to Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.
M	PRESTON	They're still trying to find a place for him to sleep.
M	DENHAM	You told him my typewriter is available for hire?
M	RESTON	Yes - he didn't take it well.
F	ANN	Mr. Driscoll ...? He's on board?
M	DENHAM	Jack has his heart set on coming. Call me a softie - I couldn't say no.
M	CHOY	This room very comfortable, plenty dim light ... fresh straw.
M	JACK	What'd you keep down here?
M	CHOY	Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it.
M	Jack	What, do you sell them to Zoos?
M	CHOY	Zoos ... circus ... Skipper get big money for rare animal. Careful! Camel have bad accident on floor. Stain unremovable ...
M	CHOY (cont'd)	Skipper catch any animal you want. He do you real good price on rhite wino. E ENGLEHORN Choy!
M	ENGLEHORN (cont'd)	My apologies for not being able to offer you a cabin. Have you found an enclosure to your taste?
M	JACK	Spoilt for choice.
M	ENGLEHORN	What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or a chimpanzee?
M	JACK	Maybe, I'll take this one.
M	ENGLEHORN	I told you to lock it up.
M	CHOY	Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -
M	ENGLEHORN	Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What are you trying to do? Put the whole ship to sleep? Get them out of here!
M	JIMMY	Compliments of the chef - Oh Christ - oh God!
M	JIMMY	Lambs brains in walnut sauce.
M	HAYES (O.S.)	Jimmy!
M	HAYES (cont'd)	You run those ropes up on deck like I told you?
M	JIMMY	Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.
M	HAYES	How about you return Mr. Driscoll's pen first?
M	HAYES (cont'd)	He doesn't mean any harm. I'll keep him out of Jyour way.
M	ACK	No, it's okay.
M	HAYES	It's just he likes it down here, it's where I found him ... four years ago ... stowed away in one of them cages. His arm was broken in two places, he was wilder than half the animals in here. Still won't tell me where he came from - all I know, it wasn't any place good.
M	HAYES	You gotta straighten up. You don't want to be on this ship for the rest of your life.
M	JIMMY	I do.
M	HAYES	No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get yourself educated. Give yourself some options. Take this serious.
M	JIMMY	I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been readin'.
M	HAYES	Where did you get this?
M	JIMMY	I borrowed it ... ... on long term loan. Look at this.
M	JIMMY (cont'd)	"Adventures on a Tramp Steamer". See - just like us.
F	ANN	It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll - I'm actually quite familiar with your work. Oh yes! ... Hello, Mr Driscoll - it's so nice to meet you! Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work. I'm a huge fan! I've read everything you've ever written.
M	IKE	I'm gonna have the ships' engines all over the dialogue - sea gulls, camera noise, wind and Christ knows what else!
M	DENHAM	I don't care, Mike! You're the sound recordist - make it work.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you to the crew! This is Herb - our cameraman ...
M	HERB	Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may I say what a lovely dress.
F	ANN	Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it on!
M	PRESTON	Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?
F	ANN	What does a girl have to do round here to get some breakfast!
M	DENHAM	Lumpy! You heard the lady!
M	LUMPY	Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge aux walnuts?
M	DENHAM	ANN, I don't believe you've met -
F	ANN	That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who this is ... Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour - to be part of this.
M	MIKE	Gee, thanks!
F	ANN	Actually - I am quite familiar with your work.
M	MIKE	Really?
F	ANN	Yes, and what I most admire - is the way you have captured the voice of the common people.
M	MIKE	Well - that's my job.
F	ANN	I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying - you don't look at all like your photograph ... A NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns
M	MIKE	Excuse me?
M	DENHAM	Wait a minute! Ann -
F	ANN	Well, he's so much younger - in person. And much better looking.
M	DENHAM	ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -
F	ANN	I was afraid you might be one of those self obsessed literary types. You know - the tweedy twerp with his nose in a book and his head up his -
M	JACK	It's nice to meet you too, Miss Darrow..
M	DENHAM (V.O.)	She's standing at the railing ... she doesn't know it yet, but they're sailing towards disaster. You got that?
M	JACK (V.O.)	She turns ... The First Mate is staggering towards her - there's a knife sticking out of his back!
M	DENHAM	ait a second, we're killing off the First Mate?
M	JACK	That's assuming she knows who the First Mate is.
M	DENHAM	Come on, Jack! It was an honest mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it could happen to anyone.
M	JACK	I was joking, Carl.
M	DENHAM	The point is: she's horrified. She has to look away. And that's when she sees it.
M	JACK	See's what? What?
M	DENHAM	The island.
M	JACK	We're filming on an island now? When did this happen?
M	DENHAM	Jack, keep your voice down! I don't want the crew getting spooked.
M	JACK	Why would they get spooked? What's it called?
M	DENHAM	All right ... It has a local name, but I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't sound good.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	They call it ...
M	JACK	What's wrong with this place?
M	DENHAM	There's nothing officially wrong with it. Because technically it hasn't been discovered yet.
M	JACK	Okay ... alright ... so we arrive at S ... k ... u ...
M	JACK (cont'd)	l ... l ... Island.
M	DENHAM	All right everyone, from the top. And ... action!
F	ANN	I think this is awfully exciting! I've never been on a ship before.
M	BRUCE	I've never been on one with a woman before.
F	ANN	I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you?
M	BRUCE	No, they're a nuisance.
M	ANN (O.S.)	Well, I'll try not to be. Just being around is trouble. Well! Is that a nice thing to say!
M	BRUCE (O.S.)	It's a dangerous thing, having girls on ships. They're messy and they're unreliable!
M	DENHAM	Cut! Great!
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Bruce, wonderful performance. You can relax for ten minutes.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	That was very natural... I felt moved.
M	B	ANGLE ON: BRUCE walking past JACK ...
M	RUCE	hat do you think, Driscoll? The dialogue's got some flow now - huh?
M	JACK	It was pure effluence.
M	BRUCE	beefed up the banter ...
M	JACK	Try to resist that impulse.
M	BRUCE	It's just a little humor, Bud - what are you, a Bolshevik or something?
M	JACK	Actors. They travel the world but all they ever see is a mirror!
M	JACK	Good legs.
M	JACK (cont'd)	Sea legs - I meant - you know ... sea legs. Not that you don't have good legs, I was just ... ... making conversation. Jesus! Miss Darrow! About the scene - today, with you and Bruce -
F	ANN	I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when a man likes a woman - then he must ignore her. And if things turn really hostile ... no?
M	JACK	Interesting theory.
F	ANN	I know ... I should have -
M	JACK	It wasn't what I had intended ... but it -
F	ANN	I'm sorry - I was ...
M	JACK	You made it your own ...
F	ANN	I was nervous.
M	JACK	It was funny, actually ... you were funny.
F	ANN	Please - don't say another word. Good night.
M	ACK	Miss Darrow ... You don't have to be nervous. A NGLE ON: JACK approaching, he is reading pages in his HAND, he
M	DENHAM	We're close. Head south-west.
M	ENGLEHORN	There's no land south-west for thousands of miles. It takes us way outside the shipping lanes. I won't sail blind in these waters.
M	DENHAM	'll make it worth your while.
M	ENGLEHORN	There's nothing out there.
M	DENHAM	hen you've nothing to lose.
M	HAYES	If someone were to tell you this ship is headed for Singapore, what would you say? sharp sound ...
M	LUMPY	I would say they was full of it, Mr. Hayes. We turned south-west last night.
M	DENHAM	Gentlemen please, we're not looking for trouble -
M	JIMMY	No. You're looking for something else
M	DENHAM	Yes .... we are. We're gonna find Skull Island! We're gonna find it, film it and show it to the world. For twenty five cents you get to see the last blank space on the map!
M	LUMPY	I wouldn't be so sure of that.
M	PRESTON	What do you mean?
M	LUMPY	Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we were working our passage on a Norwegian barque.
M	HAYES	We picked up a castaway - found him in the water - he'd been drifting for days.
M	LUMPY	His ship had run aground on an island, way West of Sumatra. An island hidden in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built so long ago - no one knew who had made it ... A wall a hundred foot high ... as strong today as it was, ages ago.
M	PRESTON	Why did they build the wall?
M	LUMPY	The castaway - he spoke of a creature, neither beast nor man, but something monstrous, living behind that wall...
M	DENHAM	A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's how all these stories start.
M	PRESTON	What else did he say?
M	LUMPY	Nothing. We found him the next morning ... he'd stuck a knife through his heart.
M	DENHAM	orry fellas, you'll have to do better than that. Monsters belong in B movies!
M	HAYES	If you find this place - If you go ashore with your friends and your cameras ... you won't come back ... Just so long as you understand that.
M	HAYES	How long do you expect us to stay out here?
F	ANN	You're writing a stage comedy?
M	JACK	I'm writing it for you.
F	ANN	Why would you do that?
M	JACK	Why would I write a play for you?
F	ANN	Yes.
M	JACK	Isn't it obvious?
F	ANN	Not to me.
M	JACK	Well, it's in the sub-text.
F	ANN	I guess I must've missed it.
M	JACK	It's not about words ...
M	RADIO OPERATOR	Message for you, Captain.
M	DENHAM	What's going on?
M	DENHAM	Hayes! Why are we turning around? Englehorn, you can't just ...
M	ENGLEHORN	Outside!
M	ENGLEHORN	There's a warrant out for your arrest. Did you know that? I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.
M	DENHAM	nother week - I haven't got a film yet. Please - I have risked everything I have on this!
M	ENGLEHORN	No, Denham - you risked everything I have. D
M	DENHAM	What do you want? Tell me what you want? I'll give you anything.
M	ENGLEHORN	I want you off my ship.
M	ENGLEHORN (cont'd)	Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes.
M	DENHAM	I'm finished. It's over for me, Jack.
M	JACK	How did you think this would end, Carl?
M	HAYES	Captain ...
M	ENGLEHORN	Check our position. Use the stars.
M	HAYES	There are no stars, Captain.
M	JACK	What is that?
M	DENHAM	What?
M	JACK	That.
M	DENHAM	I don't know ... what is it, a coffee stain? .. into a HUGE BANK of FOG that seems to melt out of the
M	ENGLEHORN	Station the for'head lookout, and get me the depth by lead-line!
M	HELMSMAN	Aye, Captain.
M	CREWMAN	Thirty fathoms ... no bottom!
M	ENGLEHORN	Reduce speed, steerage way only.
M	HAYES	Dead slow ahead, both. You should stop the ship.
M	ENGLEHORN	15 degrees Port. We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes ... we'll find clear conditions.
M	CREWMAN (O.S.)	We have seabed!
M	CREWMAN	Twenty-five fathoms!
M	HAYES	We're shallowing!
M	ENGLEHORN	20 degrees starboard!
M	HAYES	Captain, you don't know where the hell you're going!
M	ENGLEHORN	Get me another reading!
M	HAYES	Another reading!
M	CREWMAN	Twenty-two fathoms!
M	ENGLEHORN	Douse the lights!
M	HELMSMAN	Aye, aye Captain ...
M	CREWMAN	Ten fathoms!
M	JIMMY	Wall! There's a wall ahead!!!
M	ENGLEHORN	Stop engines!
M	ENGLEHORN	Give me some power! Half astern, both!
M	HAYES	Half astern, both, Captain!
M	JACK	Rocks!
M	JIMMY	Rocks to starboard ... to port ... rocks everywhere!
M	ENGLEHORN	Take the wheel, Hayes!
M	ENGLEHORN	Full ahead!
M	HAYES	Rocks to port, Captain!
M	ENGLEHORN	Hayes!
M	HAYES	he's taken a pounding ...
M	ENGLEHORN	What about the prop?
M	HAYES	Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell, but she's stuck hard against the rock -
M	JIMMY	Captain! You'd better come up quick!
M	HAYES	You want me to bring them back?
M	ENGLEHORN	I don't give a damn about Carl Denham ... I want this ship fixed and ready to float on the next high tide. We're leaving Mr. Hayes.
M	DENHAM	Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull Island! We got our picture!
M	JIMMY	Why does Marlow keep going up the river, why doesn't he turn back?
M	HAYES	There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself that sounds a warning, but there's another part, that needs to know ... that needs to defeat the thing which makes him afraid.
M	HAYES v/o	"We could not understand, because we were too far ... and could not remember, because we were travelling in the night of First Ages ...
M	HAYES V/O (cont'd)	... of those Ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign and no memories
M	HAYES V/O	We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there, there you could look at a thing monstrous and free."
M	JIMMY	It's not an adventure story - is it, Mr. Hayes.
M	HAYES	No, Jimmy, it's not.
M	PRESTON	It's deserted ...
M	DENHAM	Of course it's deserted. Use your eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin! Nobody's lived here for hundreds of years.
F	ANN	Mr Denham ... I think we should go back.
M	DENHAM	will handle this. Look chocolate ... you like chocolate? Good to eat! Take it ... take it!
M	BRUCE.	For Godsake, Denham, leave the native alone.
M	JACK	She doesn't want the chocolate!
M	DENHAM	t's alright - it's just a bunch of women and old folks ... they're harmless.
F	ANN	Mike? F AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before
M	SHA-WOMAN	Larri yu sano korê ... Kweh yonê kah`weh ad-larr ... torê Kông.
M	ENGLEHORN	Seen enough?
M	ENGLEHORN	Lighten the ship! Anything that's not bolted down goes overboard!
M	DENHAM	We got away. We gotta be grateful for that gentlemen.
M	PRESTON	What about Mike? He didn't get away - he's still there!
M	DENHAM	Mike died doing what he believed in! He didn't die for nothing. And I'll tell you something else - I'm going to finish this film - for Mike. DE finish it and proceeds to his wife and kids - because that man is a hero and he deserves nothing less!
M	HERB	Hear! Hear!
M	JACK	Where's Ann?
M	JIMMY	She went to her cabin.
M	ENGLEHORN	Wheel amidship ... Full ahead, both engines.
M	JACK	Ann!
M	JACK (O.S.)	top! Stop! Turn back, we have to turn back!
M	JACK (cont'd)	They've taken Ann!
M	HAYES	All hands going ashore ...
M	HAYES V/O	... report to stations! Jump to it!
M	HAYES (V.O.)	What the hell are you doing? You want that boat to sink? Stow those rifles midships - come on, hurry it up!
M	HAYES (cont'd)	Lower away! F LAMES DANCE ... DRUMS BEAT in a RITUALISTIC FRENZY. .. into thin air!
M	ENGLEHORN	What in God's name was that?
M	JACK	Behind the wall! LOSE ON: DENHAM staring through the LATTICE WORK of sharpened
M	JACK	She's gone!
M	JACK	She's gone! Carl? What is it? You saw something ...
M	ENGLEHORN	You can take Hayes and fifteen others. I'll put a guard on the gate until you return ... The rest of you, stay with the ship.
M	HAYES	Not you, Jimmy.
M	JIMMY	Com'on Mr. Hayes, look at `em. None of them knows a which way to point a gun.
M	HAYES	Stay here. Miss Darrow needs me!
M	HAYES	No!
M	DENHAM	Bring the tripod - and all of the film stock.
M	HERB	You wanna go with the six inch lens?
M	DENHAM	The wide angle will do just fine.
M	ENGLEHORN	You got guns, you got food, you got ammo. You got twenty-four hours.
M	BRUCE	Twenty-four hours?
M	ENGLEHORN	This time tomorrow we haul anchor. She GLANCES BACK ...
M	JACK	Ann!
M	JACK (cont'd)	Ann!
M	LUMPY	Christ! It's a bleeding bone yard! They've been ripped limb from limb.
M	JACK	ANN! Ann!
M	JIMMY	Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend you didn't see me.
M	HAYES	esus, Jimmy!
M	JIMMY	Hey! I need that!
M	HAYES	I'm not giving you a gun!
M	JIMMY	You were younger than me when they gave you one!
M	HAYES	I was in the army. I was trained - I had a drill sergeant!
M	IMMY	I just wanna help bring her back.
M	HAYES	Don't make me regret it.
M	HAYES	Conserve your ammunition!
M	LUMPY	I'm knackered! I've gotta have a breather.
M	JACK	Hey fellas - we don't have time for this. We've lost too much ground already! Come on, - get up!
M	HAYES	They're not about to quit on you. Cut them some slack. Alright, you got five minutes! Everybody stay in sight!
M	DENHAM	Over here. I wanna get a wide shot of the valley.
M	LUMPY	Bloody Nora!
M	JIMMY	Is that what took Miss Darrow?
M	LUMPY	There's only one creature capable of leaving a footprint that size ... The abominable snowman!
M	HAYES	It's gotta be - what? Twenty - twenty- five feet?
M	JACK	Carl saw it. Let's ask him.
M	HAYES	Where'd he go?
M	JACK	Carl!!! ... they stare transfixed at a HERD of grazing BRONTOSAURS.
M	DENHAM	Walk forward, Bruce.
M	BRUCE	What?!
M	DENHAM	You're the star of this picture! Get into character and head towards the animals.
M	BRUCE	What the hell kind of place is this? Are you sure about this, Denham??? Don't we have a stand-in for this type of thing?
M	DENHAM	need you in the shot, or people will say they're fake.
M	BRUCE	Nobody's gonna think these are fake!
M	DENHAM	ou're making them nervous! No sudden movement.
M	BRUCE	I'm not moving.
M	BRUCE (cont'd)	Mother of God ...
M	JACK	What is it?! Where's Carl?
M	BRUCE	He's - he's ... um ... well, he's up there ... filming. A NGLE ON: DENHAM and HERB appear on the brow of the HILL. They are
M	DENHAM	Run Jack!
M	JACK	Holy Christ!
M	HAYES	Go Jimmy - Run!
M	JACK	Leave it!!!
M	DENHAM	No!!! A NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of
M	JACK	No!!!! J ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he
M	HAYES	Go! Go!
M	JACK	Carl!? Carl?! Get up!
M	HAYES	Run!
M	DENHAM	Herb! Come on!
M	HERB	Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod.
M	DENHAM	Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up. Come on, hold on to your end.
M	HERB	You gotta go!!
M	DENHAM	I'm not going anywhere without you!
M	HERB	You gotta leave me!
M	HAYES	Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know how many injured and how bad -
M	LUMPY	Injured? Four of us are dead!
M	PRESTON	It's not your fault. What happened to Herb - it's no ones fault.
M	DENHAM	You're absolutely right, Preston ... And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that. He died believing there is still some mystery left in this world - and we can all have a piece of it - for the price of an admission ticket! Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish this film for Herb. We'll finish it, and donate the proceeds to his wife and kids.
M	BRUCE	We gotta get back to the ship. Englehorn sails in nine hours.
M	JIMMY	So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.
M	BRUCE	Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be stranded here! Miss Darrow was a great gal - no question. She was a wonderful person. It's a terrible loss. We're all gonna miss her.
M	JACK	I always knew you were nothing like the tough guy you play on screen - I just never figured you for a coward.
M	BRUCE	Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look like me - not in the real world. In the real world they've got bad teeth, a bald spot and a beer gut ... be seeing ya.
M	HAYES	Anyone else?
M	C	LOSE ON: ANN LIFTING HER HEAD, risking a quick look around. The
F	ANN	No! I said no! That's all there is ... there isn't any more.
M	C	LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is
M	J	IMMY What is it?
M	JIMMY (cont'd)	Mr. Hayes ...?
M	HAYES	If anything happens, I want you to run! Understand?
M	JIMMY	I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.
M	HAYES	It's not about being brave, Jimmy.
M	HAYES	o back! Back across the log!
M	JIMMY	I ain't gonna run.
M	HAYES	Get Jimmy out of here.
M	JIMMY	No! Let him go! Kill him! Kill him!
M	HAYES	Look at me! Look at me!
M	JIMMY	Bring him down! Mr Hayes!
M	HAYES	You've gotta run, Jimmy.
M	IMMY	No! I ain't gonna run.
M	HAYES	Do as I say. G o with Jack ... All of you. Run!
M	JIMMY	No!
M	JACK	Shoot him!
F	ANN	Hey! Here! Over here!
M	CHOY	Lumpy! Help me! she just manages to grab hold of a BRANCH as she FALLS. ANN hangs T hey ATTACK KONG and ANN ... a BREATHTAKING FIGHT to the DEATH. KONG ROARS IN PAIN AND TOGETHER THEY FALL DOWN INTO THE CHASM ... T HE TYRANNOSAUR SNARLS at KONG and he ROARS BACK ... KONG THROWS
F	ANN	Wait!
M	JACK	Carl!!!
M	JACK (cont'd)	Jimmy?
F	ANN	It's alright ... it's okay ... Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ... you. "Kong". This is you.
F	ANN	It's beautiful. Beautiful. Beau-ti-ful. CHASM ... TWO SAILORS reaching down to help him.
M	DENHAM	Thank God.
M	ENGLEHORN	Don't thank God, thank Mr. Baxter ...
M	ENGLEHORN (cont'd)	He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I knew you'd be okay ...
M	ENGLEHORN (cont'd)	That's the thing about cockroaches; no matter how many times you flush them down the toilet they always crawl back up the bowl!
M	DENHAM	ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl! I'm drying off my wings and trekking across the lid!
M	ENGLEHORN	Driscoll ... don't be a fool! Give it up, it's useless ... She's dead.
M	DENHAM	She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her back. And the ape will be hard on his heels. We can still come out of this thing okay - More than okay. Think about it, you've got a boat full of chloroform we can put to good use.
M	ENGLEHORN	You want to trap the Ape? I don't think so.
M	DENHAM	Isn't that what you do? Live animal capture? I heard you were the best. Jack! ... DENHAM raises a hand in salute.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Look after yourself!
M	JACK	Keep the Gate open.
M	DENHAM	Sure thing, buddy! Good luck!
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	I'm sorry.
F	ANN	Jack, run! No! A NGLE ON: JACK seizes his CHANCE! He rushes along the EDGE of the
M	JACK	This way! Come on! A NGLE ON: JACK and ANN are HELPLESS ... KONG almost HAS THEM! BAT-
M	ACK	Hang on to me!
M	ACK	Carl!
F	ANN	Please! Somebody help us!
M	ANN (cont'd)	They've gone.
M	JACK	Carl? Oh Christ! Carl?
M	PRESTON	Drop the bridge! Do it now, for chrissakes!
M	DENHAM	Not yet ... wait.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Wait ...
M	PRESTON	No Carl ... KONG sees ANN and charges forward!
M	ENGLEHORN	Now!!! Bring him down! Do it!
F	ANN	No!
M	JACK	Are you out of your mind? Carl!
M	DENHAM	Drop the net! Gas him!
F	ANN	No! Please - don't do this!
M	JACK	Ann ... He'll kill you!
F	ANN	No, he won't. No!
M	ENGLEHORN	Keep him down!
F	ANN	Stop it! You're killing him!
M	ENGLEHORN	Get her out of here! Get her out of his sight!
M	DENHAM	Do it!
F	ANN	Let go of me ... A NGLE ON: JACK pulling ANN by the HAND towards the TUNNEL
M	SAILOR	We can't contain him!
M	ENGLEHORN	Kill it!
M	DENHAM	No!
M	ENGLEHORN	It's over, you Goddamn lunatic!
M	DENHAM	I need him alive!
M	ENGLEHORN	Shoot it!!! Jimmy - get out of here! Get to the boat! All of you! Run!
M	JACK	Get in the boat!
F	ANN	No! It's me he wants. I can stop this -
M	JACK	Take her!
F	ANN	Let me go to him!
M	ENGLEHORN	Row! Get the hell out of here!
M	ACK	Jimmy! No! NGLE ON: DENHAM is flung into the water, still clutching the
F	ANN	Go back!
M	ENGLEHORN	Hold her!
M	DENHAM	Wait!
M	A	NGLE ON: KONG starts CRAWLING painfully towards ANN. ENGLEHORN
F	ANN	Leave him alone!
M	DENHAM	he whole world will pay to see this. We're millionaires, boys. I'll share it with all of you! In a few months his name will be up in lights on Broadway! "Kong - the Eighth Wonder of the World"!
M	A	n EXCITED and CURIOUS CROWD are converging on the THEATRE - cabs A NGLE ON: PRESTON watching from the BALCONY. He is looking at
M	DREW V/O	Look at yourself! Look at what you've become!
M	DREW	No woman is worth this!
M	EDGAR	This woman is worth it. I've gotta win her back. I don't care what it takes.
M	DREW	She's not gonna buy it for a second!
M	EDGAR	Shuddup and hand me the grapefruit.
F	THELMA	Tell me everything - every little detail!
M	JAYNE	So, he took me to a fancy French restaurant ...
F	THELMA	French, huh?
M	JAYNE	Anyway about half way through the whore derves - he clutches my hand ...
F	THELMA	He clutches your hand?!
M	EDGAR	It felt like the right thing to do at the time. Oh! I'm sorry - I couldn't help but over-hear!
M	JAYNE	He's looking into my eyes -
F	THELMA	And that's when he told you how he felt?
M	JAYNE	No - he never said it.
F	THELMA	He never said it?!
M	EDGAR	He probably thought he didn't need to say it.
F	THELMA	Then how does she know that it's real?
M	JAYNE	He said it was not about the words.
F	THELMA	Please - if you feel it, you say it. It's really very simple.
M	JAYNE	He said we'd talk about it later. Only there was no later ...
M	AYNE (cont'd)	It never happened. I just thought that maybe this one time, things might actually work out - which was really very ...
M	JACK/JAYNE	... foolish ....
M	HELMA	Men! They'll give you the world ... But they let the one thing that truly matters slip through their fingers. All for the sake of three little words!
M	EDGAR	The three hardest words in the English language!
M	DENHAM	hank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here to tell you a very strange story ... a story of our adventure in which seventeen of our party suffered horrible deaths! Their lives lost in pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous aberration of nature! But even the meanest brute can be tamed. Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see, the Beast was no match for the charms of a girl - a girl from New York ... who melted his heart. Bringing to mind that old Arabian proverb ... "And lo the Beast looked upon the face of Beauty and Beauty stayed his hand ... and from that day forward he was as one dead ..."
M	STAGE MANAGER	You're on, Miss Darrow, five minutes.
M	DENHAM	nd now Ladies & Gentlemen, I'm going to show you the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld. He was a King in the world he knew but he comes to D you now ... a captive! Ladies and gentlemen: I give you Kong - the Eighth Wonder of the World!!
M	DENHAM	Don't be alarmed, ladies and gentlemen. It is perfectly safe. These chains are made of chrome steel!
M	DENHAM	Observe if you will, I am touching the beast! I am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	We have in the auditorium tonight, a surprise guest. The real life hero of this story ... the man who hunted down the mighty "Kong"!
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	The man who risked all to win the freedom of a helpless female! A big hand for ... Mr. Bruce Baxter!
M	DENHAM (cont'd)	Ladies and Gentlemen, imagine if you will an uncharted island ... a forgotten fragment from another time ... And clinging to life in this savage place, imagine a people untutored in the ways of the civilised world. A people who have dwelt all their lives in the shadow of Fear! In the shadow of ... "Kong"!
M	PRESTON	He was right ... ... about there still being some mystery left in this world ...
M	PRESTON (cont'd)	And we can all have a piece of it ... for the price of an admission ticket.
M	JACK	That's the thing you come to learn about Carl ... his unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.
M	DENHAM	lease remain calm, Ladies and Gentlemen - for we now come to the climax of this savage ritual ... the Sacrifice of a beautiful young girl! Behold her terror as she is offered up to the mighty "Kong"! A big hand folks for the bravest girl I ever met! Miss Ann Darrow! A NGLE ON: KONG utterly CONFUSED; this is NOT ANN, but a woman in a
M	FAKE ANN	No! No! Help me, no!
M	JACK	Where is she??
M	JACK	Where's Ann?
M	PRESTON	I've no idea. I heard he offered her all kinds of money and she turned him down flat.
M	DENHAM	Here's your story, boys - "Beauty and the Man who saved her from the Beast".
M	JACK	We have get these people out of here - Everyone has to leave.
M	PRESS MAN 2	How did you feel, Mr. Baxter - when you were on the island?
M	BRUCE	Well to be honest with you, I had some anxious moments ...
M	BRUCE (cont'd)	For a while there it looked like I wasn't going to get paid ... But as it turned out, Mr. Denham here has been more than generous -
M	DENHAM	et him roar! It makes a swell picture!!!
M	JACK	Head for the exits ...
M	AUDIENCE 2	Get your own seat Buddy - you ain't having mine. J ACK watches as KONG'S FEAR builds to a growing sense of ANGER and
M	JACK	Oh Jesus ...
M	JACK	Follow that ape!
M	CABBIE	It's all yours, Buddy!
M	T	he CAB SLEWS across the STREET, disappearing up a TINY ALLEY,
M	K	ONG gently picks ANN up ... his EYES never leaving her FACE.
M	COMMANDER	Fire! A n MOBILE ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN screeches to a HALT on 34th STREET.
M	COMMANDER	Standby to fire!
M	CAPTAIN	I can't give that order! Sir, the ape's holding a girl -
M	COMMANDER	Then I guess it's her unlucky day. Take aim!
M	CAPTAIN	Sir ...?!
M	COMMANDER	Shoot to kill! Fire!
F	ANN	Beautiful ... Yes ... yes it is. No!!!
M	LD SECURITY GUARD	Hey, hey, nobody past this point. You can't go in there. E
F	ANN	No! No!
M	POLICEMAN	Come on, boys, move on! Show's over! Stay back! Behind the line!
M	PHOTOGRAPHER 1	Why'd he do that? Climb up there and get himself cornered? The ape musta known what was comin'.
M	PHOTOGRAPHER 2	It's just a dumb animal - it didn't know nuthin'! What does it matter? The airplanes got him.
M	DENHAM	It wasn't the airplanes ... ... it was beauty killed the beast.
