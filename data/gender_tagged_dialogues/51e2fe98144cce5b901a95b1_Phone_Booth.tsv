M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NARRATOR	There are 237,911 pay telephones in the five burroughs of the city of New York. Many of them are still in working order.
M	NARRATOR	Despite increased usage of cellular devices, an estimated four and a half million New Yorkers and two million visitors still utilize pay telephones on a regular basis. At thirty-five cents a pop... for the first three minutes.
M	NARRATOR	You're looking at the telephone booth at the corner of 45th Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of the Manhattan theatrical district. It has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by a kiosk. It's one of the few remaining phone booths left in the city.
M	WOMAN IN BOOTH	You have lied to me for the last time, you lowlife prick bastard! I don't ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again. Yes, well fuck you, too!
M	NARRATOR	At least three hundred calls daily originate from this booth. The coins are collected twice a day. This booth has been burglarized forty-one times in the last six months.
M	MARIO	Stu, we got to talk.
M	STU	Wish I could accommodate you, Mario, but this is my busy time of day.
M	MARIO	How come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant?
M	STU	Why don't I stop in later for some lunch?
M	MARIO	There's no more drinks or free meals until the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said.
M	STU	I'm doing my level best for you people.
M	MARIO	One lousy mention in the Post and you expect to eat for six months!
M	STU	I got the food critic from the Village Voice all lined up to give you a review.
M	MARIO	That's what you tell me last July. And he never shows.
M	STU	I was allowing you time to expand the menu. Wallpaper the bathrooms, for God sakes. You get only one shot with these fucking critics and I don't want you to blow a rare opportunity.
M	MARIO	You the one blowing it. How long you think you can fuck everybody?
M	STU	Hold on right there. I've got a very excellent reputation around this town.
M	MARIO	So how come you take two nice suits of clothes from Harry and never get his daughter on David Letterman?
M	STU	Hell, I'm not an agent. I'm a publicist.
M	MARIO	Mister, you're nothing!
M	STU	Believe me, Valerie's on the waiting list to audition. Harry's got no complaints. He just let me pick out this tie the other day.
M	MARIO	That Harry's a damn fool!
M	STU	Mario, please let me make this up to you. How about I arrange for the opening night party for this new off- Broadway show I'm handling -- to be held at your place with local TV coverage on nine and eleven? I mean I had it promised to another client -- who actually pays me money. But it isn't firmed up yet. And I could throw it your way. Maybe.
M	MARIO	What is involved?
M	STU	You'd toss in the buffet for say seventy or eighty. The producers would supply their own vino, of course. I'd deliver you a truckload of celebrities. And if they like the food, they'll all come back, naturally.
M	MARIO	What celebrities?
M	STU	You want Liza Minelli? An Oscar winner. Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?
M	MARIO	Is he still alive?
M	STU	I saw him last night going into the Four Seasons. I'll bring you over a whole VIP list when we come by for dinner.
M	MARIO	How come everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to pay?
M	STU	You can't think small like that. Hey, you still feature musicians Fridays and Saturdays?
M	MARIO	At least they work for their meals.
M	STU	What about Harry's daughter as an extra added attraction? She'll belt out five or six showtunes -- two sets a night -- and it won't cost you a fucking nickel.
M	MARIO	How come?
M	STU	Star Showcase! Let me handle setting that up. And when she eventually goes on Letterman, she'll announce I'm currently appearing over at Mario's fine supper club. Right over CBS she'll say that, Mario.
M	MARIO	You're full of shit. You know that? All bullshit!
M	STU	That's just a vulgar word for PR. Mario, you can't hurt my feelings. Even when I was a kid and they hurled certain invectives my way, it never bothered me. Other kids would fall apart if anybody called them a fucking name. Me, I just loved the attention! 'Shit-for- brains' -- that's what the bigger kids named me. And I answered to it. Hey, 'shit-for brains' reporting for duty. Everybody loved me for that. I could take abuse. After a while, I kind of wore them down. There was nothing more they could say to me. So they stopped. I kind of missed it.
M	MARIO	I'm sorry I even talked to you.
M	STU	I'll bet your loving wife put you up to this. She saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street. But I don't hold it against you personally -- you still serve up superior veal chop. Now I got urgent business to conduct, Mario.
M	STU	Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Where have you been? Do you think I have nothing to do but wait around for you to call?
M	STU	I'm only a few minutes late, loveliest individual on earth.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Stu, I'm so lonely. When can I see you?
M	STU	Good news in that arena. Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday. You know how dedicated she is. By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep. We'll have both our days and certain nights. Not to mention when they take the show on the road.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	How long is that for?
M	STU	Four to five weeks -- minimum.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Maybe I should quit my job so we can be together full time.
M	STU	I wouldn't do that.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Sometimes I think if I have to give one more fucking manicure...
M	STU	That's how you met me.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	I never saw a worse set of nails. Bit right down to the quick.
M	STU	I'm much better groomed since you've been looking after me.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	I'm glad you admit it.
M	STU	Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met her.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	She could care less how you look. She's only interested in pushing her own career. Some wife you're stuck with!
M	STU	The marriage is not without its compensations. Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I'm earning? Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity. Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out. And one thing you can't expect from your clients is loyalty. They get a couple of bad notices, they dump you. Goodbye.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Don't go.
M	STU	I wasn't saying goodbye to you. I was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month's notice.
M	STU	What? Is your watch busted? It's twenty after eleven and I'm gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction. So get out of my face!
M	STU	Sorry, honey. There will be no further interruption.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Why must you always be calling me from some booth?
M	STU	On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings. And I don't want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either. She gets the mail. She looks these items over. Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Then she suspects something.
M	STU	It's only because her last husband, the choreographer, ran around on her. She can't get that out of her head. That's how she caught onto him. The phone bills.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	She hasn't developed much skill at holding a man.
M	STU	You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is? She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you. I thought I'd feel all guilty about it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked in yet. Still, I wouldn't do anything to hurt her. Basically, Kelly's a decent individual.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	What about hurting me? Like last time?
M	STU	Hurt? You were glad to be rid of me.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	For a while I was, 'til I took stock of what was around. You're the lesser of many evils.
M	STU	That's about the nicest thing you ever said.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	I'll have it engraved.
M	STU	We've been up front with each other from the beginning. Let's keep it that way. How about a drink? Say seven o'clock? The Monkey Bar?
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Meet me in front. I don't like walking in there unescorted.
M	STU	Yeah, you're great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	It happens all the time lately.
M	STU	And wear that short black number I bought you from Bendel's.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Again? I don't know if it's me or that dress you like.
M	STU	Have a good day. Make plenty of tips. And leave the whole evening open. She thinks I've got Knicks tickets.
M	COLUMNIST (V.O.)	Speak!
M	STU	It's your boy Stuart. When was the last time I called you for a favor?
M	COLUMNIST (V.O.)	The column is already full.
M	STU	I just need one line. Anybody you wanna say was seen dining out at Mario's Stromboli restaurant. Maybe you don't hear so good? I got no space for you.
M	STU	Who's asking any favors? I'm offering reciprocal information.
M	COLUMNIST (V.O.)	Since when were you ever a reliable source?
M	STU	Check it out. Tony award-winning producer Willie Beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence at the San Remo. I got it from the doorman.
M	COLUMNIST (V.O.)	I got it from their maid yesterday. It's in the paper today. Or don't you bother to read my shit?
M	STU	Louis, my intentions were entirely honorable.
M	COLUMNIST (V.O.)	I'll drop your item in sometime next week. If you promise not to call me for a month.
M	VOICE	Don't even think about leaving that booth.
M	STU	What?
M	VOICE	Stay exactly where you are and listen carefully.
M	STU	I've got a heavy day, mister.
M	VOICE	You know better than to disobey me.
M	STU	I don't know you at all.
M	VOICE	Are you absolutely sure?
M	STU	Who is this?
M	VOICE	Someone who's watching you.
M	STU	Get lost!
M	VOICE	Love the gray suit. That red and black tie makes a nice combination.
M	STU	Where? Where are you?
M	VOICE	Closer than you think.
M	STU	I don't see you.
M	VOICE	There are any number of windows. Check them out.
M	STU	Okay, you had your little joke.
M	VOICE	I'm not sufficiently amused. Not yet. We have more to talk about.
M	STU	Do me a favor. Call up somebody else.
M	VOICE	But it's you I'm interested in. You know how many people use that booth every day?
M	STU	Why don't you tell me?
M	VOICE	Better than two-hundred people on average.
M	STU	Is that what you do? Count them?
M	VOICE	What else do I have to do? It's interesting watching people. Trying to guess who they are. And what they're up to.
M	STU	What are you -- a shut-in of some kind?
M	VOICE	You might say that. I can't go out. I might be seen.
M	STU	Somebody's looking for you?
M	VOICE	Desperately.
M	STU	The cops?
M	VOICE	Not yet.
M	STU	The ex-wife. What'd you do -- run out on child support?
M	VOICE	What kind of man do you think I am?
M	STU	Frankly, I could care less. You had your fun. Now goodbye.
M	VOICE	It's not in your best interests to hang up on me. That would make me angry.
M	STU	Isn't that just too bad?
M	VOICE	For you.
M	STU	There's ten million names in the phonebook. Pester somebody else.
M	VOICE	I never talk to people I can't see. I need to study their reactions.
M	STU	Alright, bullshit artist, what am I doing right now?
M	VOICE	Scratching your forehead with your left hand. Now you're brushing your hair back.
M	STU	Okay, okay, you got me in your scrutiny. So what?
M	VOICE	So let's talk.
M	STU	Only I got nothing to say.
M	VOICE	Oh, you will. You'll do a lot of talking before this conversation is over. And it'll only end when I want it to.
M	STU	Is that a fact? Well if you watch closely, you will see me hang up.
M	VOICE	I don't think you will.
M	STU	Why not?
M	VOICE	I interest you.
M	STU	Why should I be interested in some creep who gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths?
M	VOICE	But you're not a stranger, Stu.
M	STU	Who put you up to this?
M	VOICE	You were my very own selection.
M	STU	Why me in particular?
M	VOICE	Because you're so afraid.
M	STU	Ha! What've I got to be afraid of?
M	STU	Just about everything. You have so much to hide.
M	STU	How do you figure that?
M	VOICE	Why else would a man with a perfectly good cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth?
M	STU	That's my business.
M	VOICE	I've made it mine.
M	STU	All of a sudden I'm required to give explanations to you?
M	VOICE	In explicit detail.
M	STU	What is this? Some kind of candid camera gag? Or like that thing on HBO where the cab driver is taping what goes on in the back seat?
M	VOICE	This is not showbusiness, my friend. This is reality.
M	STU	Your reality. Not mine, you lowlife fuck.
M	VOICE	Stu, you'll be made to suffer for your attitude, so let's dispense with the vulgarities.
M	STU	Now you're threatening me! Fuck you. Could that be any clearer?
M	VOICE	You're only making it easier for me to do you harm.
M	STU	Oh yeah. Right. Can you see how I'm trembling?
M	VOICE	You will be.
M	STU	Shit, this is a new one. Fucking threatening calls in a goddam phone booth. When are you going to start with the heavy breathing.
M	VOICE	I'm not the degenerate. You are, Stu.
M	STU	You don't know anything about me.
M	VOICE	Infinitely more than you know about me.
M	STU	Like what?
M	VOICE	Like the number you dialed when you first entered the booth.
M	STU	How would you know that?
M	VOICE	I'm watching through a scope and I could clearly read the buttons you pushed. I have another extension here by the window. Shall I dial that same number back for you? Would that convince you?
M	VOICE	Let's see who's on the other end of the line.
M	STU	Don't.
M	VOICE	Too late. It's already ringing. I'll hold the receiver up so you can listen in.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Hello?
M	VOICE	Well, hello.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Who is this?
M	VOICE	Someone who's really tight with your boyfriend -- who just called you from his favorite phone booth.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	You know Stu?
M	VOICE	Stu? Oh, I know him better than anyone. What he does -- how he thinks. How he lies.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Who the hell is this?
M	VOICE	Stu is listening in. He knows what we're both saying.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Stu? Is that true? Are you there?
M	VOICE	He doesn't feel like talking.
M	STU	Mavis! Just hang up the goddam phone.
M	VOICE	She can't hear you, Stu. Only me. Mavis, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been totally honest with you. But then he can't be honest with anyone, can he?
M	MAVIS' VOICE	What's your name? To whom am I speaking?
M	VOICE	You've never heard of me, Mavis. He doesn't want you to know I exist. He wishes I didn't exist. But there isn't anything he can do about that. Still there, Stu? All you can do is listen.
M	STU	Mavis -- the guy is a fucking nutcase! Hang the fuck up.
M	VOICE	She doesn't want to. She wants to know all about us. Don't you, Mavis?
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Did his wife put you up to this? That bitch, Kelly?
M	VOICE	Oh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly. My very next call.
M	STU	He doesn't know my wife! Don't tell him anything else.
F	FELICIA	Could you hurry it along?
M	STU	Can you hear me, Mavis? Keep your big mouth shut.
M	VOICE	Is that any way to talk to a woman you love? Mavis, is he always that abusive to you?
M	MAVIS' VOICE	You're getting me all upset. I don't know who you are or how you know all this --
M	VOICE	I find out things -- from watching people and listening to them.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Just what is your relationship to Stu? That's all I want to know.
M	VOICE	Well, what do you think?
M	MAVIS' VOICE	Answer me, goddam it!
M	VOICE	Well alright. Stu and I are -- longtime companions. A pair. Two of a kind. Closer than close. Peas in a pod. Spoons in a drawer.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	You pervert!
M	VOICE	That, too.
M	STU	Don't believe a word of it. It's all lies.
M	VOICE	Too late, Stu. She already believes it.
M	MAVIS' VOICE	You can tell that scumbag never to bother me again.
M	VOICE	He won't care. He'll still have me.
M	STU	It's not true. I do care.
F	FELICIA	Get done in there, mister. I got me an important call.
M	STU	Go away.
F	FELICIA	Shit I will! Finish up!
M	VOICE	Why don't you tell me what you think of us?
M	MAVIS' VOICE	You're both disgusting.
M	VOICE	That's what he said about you. Well, if Stu didn't have the balls to come out and tell you the truth, I felt it was my responsibility to clear the air. Goodbye now, Mavis. Thanks for your time. Back to you again, Stu.
M	STU	You total asshole! How could you do that?
M	VOICE	Speaking of females, that woman hovering outside the booth -- may as well tell her that you'll be on the line forever.
M	STU	Like hell I will.
M	VOICE	I'm ready for you to take out your cellular and phone home. And this time, I'll listen in.
M	STU	There's no chance of that.
M	VOICE	Or should I call Kelly and make up something totally outrageous? You must realize by now I have a vivid imagination.
M	STU	You don't know our phone number!
M	VOICE	Are you absolutely sure? I may have been watching you on a regular basis. Keeping track of all the numbers I see you dial.
M	STU	And I'm supposed to believe that?
M	VOICE	I've put a great deal of preparation into this -- prior to actually saying hello. Now do you want to dial 832- 7165 -- or should I?
M	STU	What are you going to tell her?
M	VOICE	You'll do the talking.
M	STU	What am I supposed to say?
M	VOICE	Try telling her the truth.
M	STU	Look, I don't want to hurt Kelly. She's always there for me. It's just my nature to have a little 'strange' on the side. It doesn't mean shit.
M	VOICE	But you still find it necessary?
M	STU	Kind of like having a beautiful home. With everything you ever dreamed of. But you still need that vacation now and then. Some nice hotel room with a great view. Maybe a pool. Only you wouldn't want to spend more than a few days in any hotel. Eventually, you want to go back to your home and all your stuff. You're real glad to check out.
M	VOICE	Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? I'm sure they'll both appreciate that explanation.
M	STU	You're ruining my fucking life, you sonofabitch.
M	VOICE	Didn't I warn you about calling me names? It makes me vindictive.
M	STU	What else can you do to me?
M	VOICE	We haven't even begun.
M	STU	She's not home. She went out.
M	VOICE	I'll bet she's back. Now hold the cellular up where I can see it -- so I can be certain you don't misdial on me. A little higher and to your left. Now I have it in perfect view. Dial slowly.
F	FELICIA	If you got you a cell phone, how come you taking up the whole fucking booth! This here's an emergency!
M	STU	There's another booth on the next block.
F	FELICIA	It's busted. Every damn phone on Eighth Avenue is busted but this one.
M	STU	Well, I'm not through! Go in a restaurant or someplace, but get away from me!
F	FELICIA	I'm gonna pull you out of that booth and snatch you ballheaded!
F	FELICIA	You assaulted my person.
M	STU	Let me hear from your lawyer!
F	FELICIA	You're hear alright. I'm coming back. And your ass better not be around.
M	VOICE	Good work, Stu. Now let me see you dial. Tuck the receiver under your chin and dial your remote.
M	STU	I'm doing it.
M	STU	I told you she was out.
M	VOICE	Let it ring.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Shepard residence.
M	VOICE	Hold it close to the receiver so I can hear.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Hello?
M	STU	Honey, it's me.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	What's taking you so long? I thought we were having some lunch at Mario's?
M	STU	Change of plan. We're not eating in that dump any more.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	How come?
M	STU	The Health Department gave them a 'C' rating -- that's how come. Here I'm trying to put the place on the map and he fucks it all up with a major roach problem.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	That's disgusting. Okay, I'll fix us a sandwich. Where are you now?
M	STU	Just in a phone booth.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	How come? The caller ID says you're on your cellular.
M	STU	Oh yeah, I am.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	But you're also in some phone booth?
M	VOICE	Explain that one, Stu.
M	STU	I only stepped in because the traffic was so loud outside.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Well just hurry on back.
M	VOICE	Tell her you can't.
M	STU	Not for a few minutes.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Are you sure you're alone? I hear somebody in the background.
M	STU	The guy in the next booth. He's got a bad connection and he's hollering his fool head off.
M	VOICE	You've got an answer for everything.
M	STU	I love you, baby.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Do you?
M	STU	You know that.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Stu -- who was that man?
M	STU	What man?
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago -- just after you went out.
M	STU	I don't understand...
M	KELLY'S VOICE	This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone -- because you'd be calling me in a few minutes -- from a booth. And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth?
M	STU	And what did this guy say?
M	KELLY'S VOICE	He said you'd be making phone calls. What else?
M	STU	Making calls is part of my business.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	To whom?
M	STU	Clients. People. Planting items like I do.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Women?
M	STU	Once in a while one of them could be a woman. I just called "Elaine's" and talked to her to see who was in there last night.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	You know exactly what I mean.
M	STU	You're not going to start that shit again?
M	KELLY'S VOICE	I just feel something is wrong.
M	STU	What could be wrong?
M	KELLY'S VOICE	The way you sound. You don't sound like yourself.
M	STU	Yeah? Who do I sound like?
M	KELLY'S VOICE	Someone who's scared. There's fear in your voice like I've never heard before.
M	VOICE	See, Stu? Kelly agrees with me.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	I want you to come back home. Now!
M	STU	I told you. In a while.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	No. I want you here now. In case he calls back, I don't want to answer again.
M	STU	Why should he call back?
M	KELLY'S VOICE	I feel like he's going to.
M	STU	You're the one that sounds frightened. And of nobody.
M	KELLY'S VOICE	He's not a nobody. He knows about us.
M	STU	You're not telling me all he said. What are you holding back?
M	KELLY'S VOICE	I can't discuss it on the phone. Just get over here!
M	STU	Why did you do that to her? She never did you any harm.
M	VOICE	How would you know? Everybody does harm to somebody. And then they try their best to forget it.
M	STU	Maybe me -- but not her. Whatever I've done, there's no reason to take it out on her.
M	VOICE	Suppose that's the only way I can get to you? You claim you love her.
M	STU	Yeah, I do.
M	VOICE	You don't even love yourself.
M	STU	But Kelly... I would never hurt.
M	VOICE	Still you have to uphold your status as an honorary asshole.
M	STU	Listen, I've treated all my women decent. I never laid a hand on any of them, even when provoked. And I always let them down easy. I'm not ready to let Kelly go. Maybe I never will be.
M	VOICE	What if she dumps you first? What's the odds she's already taken up with somebody? One day soon you'll come home and find her gone along with the CD player and the VCR.
M	STU	I'm not gonna let you mind-fuck me all day! That's it. This call is ended.
M	VOICE	Not until I say it is.
M	STU	What happens if I hang up?
M	VOICE	You don't really want to find out.
M	STU	I'm dying to hear this!!! What the fuck can you do about it -- up in your fucking high window with your goddam binoculars?
M	VOICE	I never indicated I had binoculars. I said I had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that brought you up so close I could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this morning.
M	STU	Oh -- while you're at it, have a look up my ass.
M	VOICE	I may very well do that, Stu. In the meantime, think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it.
M	STU	What? You mean... like a rifle?
M	VOICE	A high-powered .30 calibre bolt action Remington 700 with a carbon one modification and a state of the art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. And you're in the cross hairs, Stu.
M	STU	I'm supposed to believe that?
M	VOICE	There's only one way I can prove it to you. Hang up the receiver and find out. At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.
M	STU	And you're just going to kill me for no reason?
M	VOICE	For plenty of reasons! Because you hung up. For years I hated people hanging up on me. Ex-girlfriends. Women I didn't even know. Prospective employers.
M	STU	I get hung up on all the time. You get used to it.
M	VOICE	Or else you don't. I worked for months getting people to switch to MCI -- being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day. The ones that cursed me out for invading their privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply.
M	STU	Then why didn't you go after one of them?
M	VOICE	Maybe you are one of them.
M	STU	Hey, I have worked in a boiler room myself peddling "Term Life." I would never be rude to a fellow salesperson.
M	VOICE	Can you feel it on you now? The heat of it. I'm moving the strike zone down to your stomach area. Now I'm raising it up again. Directly above the chest cavity -- sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear.
M	STU	Shit -- I do feel it.
M	VOICE	Tell me where I'm going with it now.
M	STU	Across my forehead -- now back where it was before.
M	VOICE	I'm amazed how you can do that. You're amazingly accurate. Now I know what you're thinking. If I drop down on the floor of the booth and flatten myself out...
M	STU	No, I'm not thinking that.
M	VOICE	Oh yes you are. Can I crawl out using the booth as a shield? Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away? The shattering glass may cut me, but it'll only be superficial. Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive.
M	STU	No. You will. I know you will. If I just cooperate.
M	VOICE	Where is it now? Think and feel for the warm spot.
M	STU	Below the shoulder?
M	VOICE	Which one?
M	STU	The right shoulder.
M	VOICE	Remarkable how we're in tune. You're doing far better than the others.
M	STU	What others? What do you mean? You said 'others!'
M	VOICE	I'm sure you read about the Italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth?
M	STU	I saw it on the news.
M	VOICE	And where are we now?
M	STU	Oh, God. Forty-fifth and Eighth.
M	VOICE	What else do you remember about that killing?
M	STU	I don't know.
M	VOICE	Try.
M	STU	He was gunned down. And nobody was caught. And they didn't even bother to take his wallet or his watch... or anything.
M	VOICE	Now you know why. It wasn't a robbery.
M	STU	What did he do?
M	VOICE	He hung up -- so I disconnected him permanently.
M	STU	Please -- don't do it to me. You got no reason to do it to me.
M	VOICE	Don't give me reason.
M	STU	I'm not looking to. Tell me what you want!
M	VOICE	Tell me about your job.
M	STU	What's to tell? I'm in Public Relations. They used to call us "flacks." Now we're media consultants.
M	VOICE	What do you do, exactly?
M	STU	Plant items in the paper and on the tube. More important sometimes, keep stuff out.
M	VOICE	What've you kept out?
M	STU	One of my people got nailed for indecent exposure. I managed for the cops to use his real name instead of his stage name so nobody picked up on it.
M	VOICE	You saved the little deviate's ass, didn't you?
M	STU	He's in major therapy now. I swear he is.
M	VOICE	You must hang with some major celebrities. Journalists, newscasters -- those types.
M	STU	I'm real close with Larry King. And the "Hard Copy" people.
M	VOICE	Could you get him down here? Larry King?
M	STU	Why would he want to come here?
M	VOICE	Because you asked him to.
M	STU	He comes from Atlanta.
M	VOICE	Well, who could you get?
M	STU	I don't know.
M	VOICE	Wolf Blitzer?
M	VOICE	Probably not.
M	VOICE	Regis?
M	STU	Definitely no chance.
M	VOICE	You'd be offering them an exclusive newsbreak. I'm talking about more than one homicide.
M	STU	How many?
M	VOICE	I don't answer questions. I ask them.
M	STU	I gotta have the facts. They might not believe me. My record isn't too good when it comes to hard news.
M	VOICE	You're not considered a reliable source?
M	STU	On a divorce or separation, maybe. Or who's gay, or who isn't gay any more. I kind of specialize in that kind of material. I mean I could probably get you Joe Franklin.
M	VOICE	How about Cindy Adams?
M	STU	I might have a shot. Are you familiar with Liz Smith?
M	VOICE	Do you know her number?
M	STU	Want I should call her? How much can I say?
M	VOICE	Tell her you're in direct touch with a killer who's willing to speak honestly if she shows up here alone and without notifying the authorities.
M	STU	She usually likes to have a celebrity involved. If you had an actor or a sports figure held prisoner instead of me, there'd be better odds she's come.
M	VOICE	Then lie. Pick a celebrity and put them in the booth.
M	STU	Let's see. Who does she like? Who couldn't be reached to deny it?
M	VOICE	I'm anxious to see you in action. Don't keep me waiting.
M	STU	Sometimes you only get her service. Hi -- Stu Shepard. Put me through. I've got hard news for her. I can only talk to her directly. But say it regards -- Liza.
M	VOICE	Liza? That was imaginative.
M	STU	No, I can't call back. I'll have to lay in on somebody else. Alright, but I can't hang on long. She's coming on. Liz, hello. Sure I'll make it brief. Killing two weeks ago in the theatre district? Turn out a sniper did the job. Yeah, a sniper with a rifle. Now he's got another victim lined up. Not just your anonymous New Yorker, but Liza. Now you can't call anybody or Ms. Minelli's dead meat and so am I. She's hostage in a phone booth right in the sniper's sights. But he says he'll talk to you and let her walk. I know it'll take balls to do this, but you're a fine and courageous newspaper woman...
M	STU	Hello? Hello? Either she's on her way over or she doesn't believe me.
M	VOICE	You weren't particularly convincing.
M	STU	I didn't really believe in what I was saying.
M	VOICE	Because you don't really believe my Remington is pointed at you?
M	STU	I do.
M	VOICE	You're ninety percent sure.
M	STU	At least ninety-five percent, easy.
M	VOICE	Let me erase all doubt.
M	STU	No. Don't shoot.
M	VOICE	Control yourself, Stu. Glance down at your chest. What do you see.
M	STU	Oh, my God. A dot. A fucking red dot.
M	VOICE	Like you've seen in the movies?
M	STU	The laser dot. Just before some poor bastard always gets blown away.
M	VOICE	Usually a supporting player. That lovely but by now generic special effect of the bullet piercing the forehead.
M	VOICE	This takes all the guesswork out of it. You know exactly where to expect it before I even tighten my finger on the trigger.
M	STU	Don't tighten. Don't even tickle that fucking finger.
M	VOICE	How about Geraldo? He's run his ass off to get in on this.
M	STU	You're talking about the old Geraldo. Look, I can try and reach cable NBC. They're hungry.
M	VOICE	I'm disappointed. I wanted to go first class.
M	STU	They do a great job. They'll haul a whole crew over to cover your surrender "live."
M	VOICE	I never expressed interest in giving myself up. There are so many other phone booths in the city. I'm just getting warmed up.
M	STU	That's entirely up to you. Your choice. I'm just trying to set you up with the proper communicator. I suppose Liza wasn't strong enough. I should've said Madonna.
M	VOICE	Now you're being creative.
M	LEON	Drag your baggy butt out of that booth. We got business to conduct out of there.
F	FELICIA	He been in there all day.
M	STU	I'm not through.
M	LEON	Hang up that receiver or I'll make you eat the fucking thing!
M	STU	Fuck off or I'll call a cop.
M	LEON	Do you see one around here? What you think I'm gonna be doing while you're waiting for a prowl car to get assigned? I'm about to cut you a second asshole if you don't vacate those premises.
M	STU	I can't.
F	FELICIA	He's got him a fucking cellular. What's he need to be on our booth for?
M	STU	I can't explain it.
M	LEON	I'm not interested in your explanations even if you had any.
M	LEON	If I flick this, I use it.
M	STU	I'll make it worth your while to go away. How much do you want?
M	LEON	Make me an offer.
M	STU	Thirty dollars. It's all I've got in cash. Take it and go.
M	LEON	You're offering to rent my phone booth? For how long?
M	STU	I don't know. For as long as it takes.
M	LEON	What's so special in there?
M	STU	Do you want the money?
M	LEON	Is that a genuine Rolex you've got on?
M	STU	Come on, man. That's my good watch.
M	LEON	That's what it's gonna take.
M	STU	Then here. Take the damn thing.
M	LEON	And the thirty!
M	STU	Take it all.
M	LEON	Now I'm satisfied. But you still got to deal with Felicia here. I believe you spoke harshly to her.
M	STU	I apologize.
M	LEON	And did her some injury.
M	STU	An accident. I'm sorry about that, too.
F	FELICIA	The man don't sound like he means it.
M	LEON	I agree. Why don't you hang up a minute so we can discuss this matter at length.
M	STU	It's long distance. I can't lose the call -- I might not get them back.
M	LEON	Do I have to rip that fucking phone out of there?
M	STU	That wouldn't be a good idea. Would it?
M	VOICE	Not at all.
M	STU	I gave you everything I've got.
M	LEON	That pinky ring looks attractive. Felicia might like that.
F	FELICIA	It might fit.
M	STU	You want the ring, you've got the ring. If I can get it off.
M	LEON	I can get it off you.
M	STU	Let go of me! It's coming loose. There. Okay, Felicia, with my deepest apologies. Goodbye now.
M	LEON	What's really going on in that booth -- that escapes the naked eye?
M	STU	Nothing. Talk. That's all.
M	LEON	That your connection on the end of the line? Or are you dealing?
M	STU	This has nothing to do with drugs.
M	LEON	You gotta be high on something to willingly divest yourself of your valuables -- just to maintain occupancy of a fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night.
M	STU	I knew it smelled for some reason.
M	LEON	You look like you're ready to piss yourself.
M	STU	Because I am.
M	LEON	Maybe if the city provided decent public toilets, folks wouldn't relieve themselves in the subway stations and phone booths!
M	STU	I'll take it up with the mayor.
M	LEON	Next thing you know you're gonna claim we mugged you -- took your billfold and watch.
M	STU	No, you didn't. It was a fair and equitable deal. You had territorial rights to this booth and I paid a license fee. Fair is fair. Now leave me in peace.
M	LEON	You sure you're alright? He don't look well.
F	FELICIA	Kind of pale. Even for a white man.
M	LEON	Jaundice they calls it. Probably advanced liver trouble. If it's cirrhosis, you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick.
M	STU	Thanks for your interest but I'm in perfect health.
F	FELICIA	So how come his hand is shaking?
M	LEON	The man is cracking up.
F	FELICIA	Lookit the sweat pouring off the sonofabitch. That's one sick mother you started up with, Leon!
M	LEON	Me? You're the one that brought me over and exposed me to all his germs.
M	STU	I'm terminal, okay? Now can I close the booth and continue my conversation?
M	LEON	I'm worried now it might be catching. All that money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and incurable disease.
M	STU	Fine. Give it back.
M	LEON	What good's that? We done touched it.
M	STU	Well go wash your hands.
M	LEON	Come on now. Own up to what you're carrying. Is it some of that sexually transmitted shit? Cause in that case, we can relax.
M	STU	I'm sick of you. Now get out of my face.
M	LEON	Here we's being solicitous as to your health and you respond by heaping abuse!
F	FELICIA	Whip his arrogant ass.
M	STU	Touch me and I'll throw up on you.
M	STU	You can see what I'm up against here.
M	VOICE	Want me to get rid of him for you?
M	STU	What do you have in mind?
M	VOICE	I'll think of something.
M	STU	God -- no. Don't. It's not necessary.
M	VOICE	You asked for my help.
M	STU	I'll handle it myself.
M	VOICE	You're not doing too well. I can settle it in a fraction of a second. Shall I demonstrate?
M	STU	No. For your own safety, mister, just walk away.
M	LEON	Now the man is turning aggressive... issuing threats upon my person.
M	STU	You're making this happen.
M	LEON	If you don't hang up and step out, I'm about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it.
M	STU	This isn't my fault. Stop that!
M	STU	The guy's insane!
M	VOICE	Only one way to stop a mad dog. Give me permission.
M	STU	I can't.
M	VOICE	If he forces you out of that booth, I've told you what to expect. You or him, Stu.
F	FELICIA	Don't cut yourself, honey.
M	DERELICT	Looks like the fucker is comin' loose.
M	STREET PERSON	Shove it out into the oncoming traffic.
M	DERELICT	What'll you bet the bus could knock that fifty feet?
M	STU	Hello? Hello?
M	VOICE	You're breaking up. We're about to be cut off.
M	STU	I can't help it!
M	VOICE	That counts as a hang-up.
M	STU	No. It can't. That's not fair.
M	VOICE	I can still make him stop. Say the word. Can you hear me?
M	STU	Yes.
M	STU	You did it!
M	VOICE	You said 'yes.'
M	STU	I said 'Yes, I can hear you.' Not 'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!'
M	VOICE	Don't try to renege on it. I was following orders.
M	STU	You're twisting it all around. I didn't do this!
F	FELICIA	I warned you not to cut yourself. Look at all that blood. He must've hit an artery.
F	FELICIA	Oh, Jesus. What is that? Talk to me! What happened?
M	DERELICT	Gunshot!
M	STREET PERSON	Yeah. Sucking chest wound right over the heart.
F	FELICIA	Somebody call an ambulance.
M	STREET PERSON	Call the meatwagon. He's fucked up.
F	FELICIA	You shut the fuck up!
F	FELICIA	Why did you do that to him?
M	STU	I didn't.
F	FELICIA	You all saw it! He shot my man without no provocation!
M	DERELICT	Yeah. Pumped one right into him at close range.
M	STU	How could I? I don't even have a gun. Look!
M	STREET PERSON	Everybody get the fuck back! They shoot one -- then they shoot everybody in sight! Kill all the fucking witnesses!
M	STU	Come back. You've got to see -- I'm not armed.
F	FELICIA	Hang up and dial 911. Get a doctor!
M	STU	I can't hang up. That's what this is all about.
F	FELICIA	You're gonna stand there and let him die?
M	STU	I can use this. Emergency. Yes. There's been a shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth -- on the corner. A man is down. What's the difference who I am? I don't want to be involved.
F	FELICIA	That's bullshit. He's the shooter. You're talking to the shooter.
M	STU	That wasn't nice.
F	FELICIA	Go ahead -- make a fucking run for it. I hope they gun you down -- like you did him!
M	STU	I'm not going anyplace. I'm staying right here in this booth. Unless you give me permission.
M	VOICE	You're attracting a lot of attention. I suppose when the police get there, you'll accuse me.
M	STU	What do you expect me to say?
M	VOICE	That's up to you. But any mention of me will not be appreciated.
M	STU	You mean...?
M	VOICE	You won't even get to finish your sentence. Oh look, that little red dot is dancing around all over you again. You saw how quickly it can happen. And how accurate I can be.
M	STU	They can't blame me -- I'm not armed.
M	VOICE	Who's going to believe that? With all those witnesses to the contrary.
M	STU	They can see with their own eyes.
M	VOICE	Remember to leave me out of it.
M	STU	How can I?
M	VOICE	You'll put the proper spin on it. Isn't that your specialty? Feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of truth -- and making it totally believable?
M	STU	This isn't a story. This is real. This is murder.
M	VOICE	If you'd only dealt with the man reasonably, shown him some respect, this might not have been necessary.
M	STU	I gave him my money, my watch...
M	VOICE	But not your respect. Which is what he required of you.
M	STU	He was a fucking thief.
M	VOICE	And now he's a fucking dead thief. Do you feel better about that?
M	STU	I don't feel a bit guilty. This is all your doing!
M	VOICE	Now you're being disrespectful of me. You never learn. Your job is to deal with people -- but you're not good at it.
M	STU	Hey, I'm not taking any more criticism from some lunatic sniper who gets his kicks killing strangers.
M	VOICE	You keep insisting I'm a stranger. Probably because you don't recognize the voice. But there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice. I might not even be a man. I might be one of those many women you've almost totally forgotten. One who doesn't forgive easily. One who wants to watch you squirm.
M	STU	You're a man. I know you're a man. Women don't kill with telescopic rifles. They stab you.
M	VOICE	You sound so sure of that. But you've never provoked any man as much as have the women in your life. And so many of them, Stu. Do you even remember their names?
M	STU	I've got no time to rehash my whole life. Oh my God! The cops are here.
F	FELICIA	That's him -- in the booth. He's got a gun!
M	SERGEANT	Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.
M	STU	They're ordering me to come out.
M	VOICE	I can see that. Ignore them.
M	STU	What if they open fire?
M	VOICE	They probably won't. Look across on the east side of the street. Do you see the tourist with the home video camera?
M	STU	What about him?
M	VOICE	He's going to keep the police on their best behavior. So long as you don't take what could be interpreted as hostile action, you'll be safe.
M	STU	You call this safe? Six cops with guns pointed my way?
M	VOICE	You want me to reduce them to three -- or two?
M	STU	Absolutely no more shooting. Now is that clear?
M	VOICE	You can always change your mind.
M	SERGEANT	You know the drill. Hands clasped behind the back of your neck -- moving slowly -- step out of the booth. If we see any sign of a weapon, we will respond.
M	STU	You won't, because there isn't any.
M	SERGEANT	I repeat. Raise your hands.
M	STU	I can't. I'm on a phone call.
M	CAPTAIN RAMEY	You have thirty seconds to comply.
M	STU	I told you. I'm busy. Come back later.
M	VOICE	Very good, Stu.
M	RAMEY	You've been given an order.
M	SERGEANT	We're dealing with a mental case. He's looking for us to kill him.
M	RAMEY	Well he's not getting his wish.
F	FELICIA	Tell me he's gonna be alright.
M	MEDIC	Step aside. Let us look at him.
M	MEDIC	Nothing we can do. Don't touch the body. They'll need it to mark the crime scene.
M	SERGEANT	Same corner as two weeks ago.
M	RAMEY	Maybe it's more than a coincidence. Cover me. I need to talk to him.
M	SERGEANT	You've got your vest on?
M	RAMEY	What do you think?
M	RAMEY	I'm not armed.
M	STU	Neither am I.
M	RAMEY	Yeah, sure. I need to know what happened.
M	STU	Can't talk about it.
M	RAMEY	Sure you can. My name's Ramey. Captain Ed Ramey. What's yours?
M	STU	Look, I don't want to be friends.
M	RAMEY	You look like you need a friend.
M	VOICE	Tell him you've already got a friend.
M	STU	I've got a friend, okay.
M	RAMEY	Is that who you're talking to on the phone?
M	STU	None of your business.
M	RAMEY	When somebody gets shot, it becomes my business. Let's not have anybody else killed. I want to hear your side of it.
M	STU	I've got no side of it.
M	VOICE	Don't worry, Stu. I've got him fixed right in my sights. I won't let him hurt you.
M	RAMEY	Has this happened to you before? The need to hurt someone? To put a bullet in them?
M	STU	You won't believe anything I say.
M	RAMEY	Try me.
M	STU	I couldn't shoot anybody. I'm not armed.
M	RAMEY	You're right. I don't believe you. What's that bulge in your pants pocket?
M	STU	That? That's my cellular.
M	RAMEY	A cellular? Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?
M	STU	Do you want to see it?
M	RAMEY	Don't reach for it, mister.
M	STU	Then how can I show it to you? I don't need to see it. I know what's there. All these witnesses saw you use it on him.
M	STREET PERSON	Damn straight!
M	DERELICT	Yeah! Shot him down like a dog!
M	STU	They're all lying. Nobody saw it because it didn't happen.
M	RAMEY	A man is dead but it didn't happen.
M	STU	Not on account of me! This is like some bad dream.
M	RAMEY	You're walking through a bad dream and you can't wake up. Do you want to wake up?
M	STU	I'm trying.
M	RAMEY	And in this dream, you killed that man. He was bothering you so you iced him.
M	STU	No.
M	RAMEY	Then who did?
M	VOICE	Don't tell him, Stu. Or it'll be the last thing he ever hears. His blood will be on your hands.
M	STU	I don't know.
M	RAMEY	But you saw it happen?
M	STU	Yes.
M	RAMEY	You were the closest one to him. You must've seen who did it.
M	STU	No.
M	RAMEY	We're trying to be honest with each other, aren't we?
M	STU	Not necessarily.
M	VOICE	I'm losing patience with this cop.
M	STU	I'm handling this.
M	RAMEY	Who do you keep talking to on the phone?
M	STU	Nobody. My psychiatrist.
M	VOICE	Excellent, Stu. You're getting good at this.
M	RAMEY	What's this doctor's name? It's important we know.
M	STU	He says not to tell you. It's privileged information.
M	VOICE	Damn good reply. Now you're having fun. Admit it.
M	STU	Whatever you say.
M	VOICE	Playing it so close to the edge. I'll bet you've never felt so alive. That's how I feel when I look through the sight and select somebody.
M	RAMEY	I respect your right to privacy. I've been to therapy myself. The department provides it. I know it's not good form for a cop to be admitting that, but...
M	VOICE	Tell him not to come any closer.
M	STU	Stop right there. Back up a few steps. Back where you were.
M	RAMEY	If it makes you more comfortable.
M	VOICE	Tell him to read you your rights.
M	STU	I want you to read me my rights and stop asking questions.
M	RAMEY	Al least tell me your first name.
M	STU	It's my right not to have any name.
M	RAMEY	No gun and no name. You're a highly underprivileged person.
M	VOICE	Demand a lawyer.
M	STU	And get me a lawyer, too. I want a lawyer brought down here to negotiate my surrender.
M	VOICE	Brilliant, Stu. Keep winging it.
M	RAMEY	It'll be hard to find a lawyer willing to risk his life. But if you hand over the gun...
M	STU	How can I when you won't let me take it out?
M	RAMEY	We'll take it out for you -- as soon as you exit the booth with your hands raised and...
M	STU	Now we're back to that again. It's always "Get out of the booth.' 'You can't stay in the booth.' Well, I like it in the fucking booth. It's my whole world now. It's my booth and I'm never coming out.
M	RAMEY	We're not about to force you because there could be a miscalculation and then we'd never find out why this happened.
M	STU	Why is it so important to know? The guy is dead. Isn't that enough? Knowing isn't going to make him alive again. So who gives a fuck!
M	RAMEY	It's what makes the job interesting. Finding out why. Something drove you to do this. You didn't go out today expecting this to happen. It was a nice day. You were out for a walk. And then suddenly it all changed.
M	STU	All I wanted was to make a phone call. One lousy phone call for thirty- five fucking cents.
M	VOICE	Careful, Stu. Don't volunteer too much.
M	RAMEY	You got some bad news on that call.
M	STU	The worst.
M	RAMEY	Something that pushed you over the edge?
M	STU	And I've been falling ever since.
M	RAMEY	Time to land.
M	STU	When you hit bottom, you die.
M	RAMEY	I'm your safety net.
M	STU	If I tell you what you want to know -- you'll die, too.
M	RAMEY	I'll go see about that lawyer.
M	STU	Now that's a good idea.
M	VOICE	He's lucky. I had him centered in my cross hairs. I really had to restrain myself.
M	VOICE	It's not the police. It's the media. You're news, Stuart.
M	VOICE	You've never gotten this much press for any of your clients. I'm making you a famous person.
M	STU	They're just hoping for coverage of me dying in the gutter.
M	VOICE	Their presence is putting the police on their continued best behavior.
M	STU	Those cops are just looking for any excuse.
M	VOICE	Then don't give them one.
M	VOICE	Who could it be?
M	STU	Kelly. She was worried about me.
M	VOICE	Maybe she's seen this on television. It must be on every channel by now. Breaking news.
M	STU	She doesn't watch daytime TV.
M	VOICE	One of the neighbors could've alerted her.
M	STU	Why are you saying this? You want me to reach in my pocket so you can see them open fire?
M	VOICE	That's an unwarranted accusation and very unbecoming in light of the good advice I've given in the past. Have I ever steered you wrong?
M	STU	God -- how I'd love to hear her voice.
M	VOICE	It might even be worth it. She's insistent, isn't she?
M	STU	If she knows I'm in trouble, she won't give up.
M	VOICE	Probably glued to the TV by now. I'm watching coverage on two stations now. Channel surfing. Well, there you are on two and four and five. Not any decent angles on you, though, stuck inside there.
M	VOICE	But if you'd take one or two steps outside and look up, I think they could get a clear picture of you.
M	STU	You said I'm not allowed to leave the booth.
M	VOICE	I might be willing to bend the rules and let you enjoy your moment of fame. Set the phone down without hanging up... and take a step or two outside. Just for a minute. Then come straight back in or I'll be forced to provide 'live' coverage that should rival the historic Zapruder footage. Nothing like an exploding head to excite viewer interest.
M	STU	No, thanks. I'll stay where I am.
M	VOICE	It was only a suggestion. Since you're convinced I'm going to plug you anyway, it can't matter much.
M	STU	If you shoot me, you give yourself away.
M	VOICE	Even without a muffler, they'd never hear the report with all this noise. Afterwards, it'd take them a good ten minutes to realize you weren't plugged by some overzealous officer. Then they'll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down here and do the SWAT team's job for them.
M	STU	You expected them to come. You had this all worked out.
M	VOICE	I write the scenario and you all play your parts -- as directed.
M	STU	Poor Kelly. What she must be going through.
M	VOICE	Why don't you tell her how you feel about her?
M	STU	I'd never get the words out. Not with fifteen or twenty rounds in me.
M	VOICE	You can't be certain they'd fire. They'd see it was only a phone.
M	STU	They wouldn't wait to see.
M	STU	Why doesn't she hang up?
M	STU	It's her! She's not calling me. She's over there.
M	VOICE	Is she?
M	STU	The blonde girl in the green jacket.
M	VOICE	Can't miss her. Very attractive, isn't she?
M	STU	She must've heard all the commotion and come downstairs.
M	STU	It's somebody else who knows my cell number. It's you!
M	VOICE	You continue to impress.
M	STU	Why is it so important that they kill me?
M	VOICE	Because that's how I win.
M	STU	This time you won't. If you want me dead, you'll have to do it yourself.
M	VOICE	Either way I can't lose.
M	STU	It's all a game to you -- because you're incapable of feelings. You're not even human.
M	VOICE	I pride myself on that. What's so great about being human? It's the lowest form of life on this planet and I've taken it upon myself to thin the herd.
M	STU	I quit. I'm not answering back any more. I won't hang up but I'm not playing.
M	VOICE	Stu? Stu, don't be that way. You're taking the pleasure out of it.
M	SERGEANT	This here's Helfand, of New York Telephone.
M	HELFAND	Glad to help out.
M	RAMEY	Have you got the number of that booth?
M	HELFAND	Sure do.
M	RAMEY	Can you tap into that call?
M	HELFAND	It can be done.
M	SERGEANT	But not without a warrant. You could be violating this psycho's civil rights. Especially if he's on the line with his fucking psychiatrist.
M	RAMEY	Shit. I don't want to blow this on a technicality. Tracing the call isn't any violation, is it?
M	SERGEANT	As long as we don't listen in.
M	RAMEY	Okay, we've got to know who he's talking to and their current location.
M	HELFAND	That I can handle. As long as they keep the circuit open.
M	RAMEY	I need the number and an address to go with it.
M	VOICE	Stuart, my friend. Do you want to see how close I can come without actually hitting you?
M	VOICE	May I call attention to the yellow pages?
M	VOICE	Hollow points are designed to break up on impact. It would've behaved differently if it had pierced your soft flesh. The pieces would've bounced around looking for a way out. That's where the real damage occurs -- finding an exit -- deflecting off all that bone...
M	VOICE	Still the silent treatment? My father used to dish that out when he chose to punish me. Not a word spoken -- one time for over a month. I'd try and goad him to acknowledge I existed, but he stared right through me. You're bringing back unhappy childhood, Stu. That's not wise.
M	VOICE	Since you're ignoring me, I'll focus on someone else. There she is -- nice and sharp. I can see the two little punctures in each earlobe and my God, what kind of a girl would have her nostril pierced?
M	STU	No!
M	VOICE	What was that? Louder, Stu. We must have a bad connection.
M	STU	Leave her out of it.
M	VOICE	I didn't expect her to show up here. But since she has -- I'll improvise.
M	STU	Don't. Please don't. I'm sorry. I'm talking to you again. I'll talk all you want!
M	VOICE	It's a bad dye job. The black roots are growing in and it makes her look cheap.
M	STU	I've screwed up her life enough already. Please don't hurt her.
M	VOICE	I don't necessarily have to kill her. I could be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation. Which part of her displeases you most? If she turns a bit more in profile, I'm accurate enough to remove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose. It's just cartilage. Any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking better than ever.
M	VOICE	You can see her talking to the police now. She's identifying herself as your wife. They're very interested in who you are. They're taking her over to see the officer in charge. What was his name?
F	KELLY	What do you mean psychiatrist? He doesn't see any psychiatrist.
M	RAMEY	Then who'd your husband be talking to?
F	KELLY	There was some guy that called the house this morning and said weird stuff to me.
M	RAMEY	Stu seems to be checking things out with this person.
F	KELLY	He hasn't got many friends -- I can tell you that.
M	RAMEY	Remain here, please. We may need you later.
F	KELLY	You won't hurt him?
M	RAMEY	We'll do our best not to.
M	VOICE	She won't even feel it when it happens.
M	STU	Take me instead.
M	VOICE	Don't distract me. Now's the time to be absolutely still. I have to hold my breath as I squeeze gently --
M	STU	No! I'm hanging up. That's it.
M	RAMEY	Shit. He hung up.
M	SERGEANT	Maybe they already traced it. Anyhow, it doesn't matter. Looks like he's coming out.
M	STU	I've giving myself up. Take me!
M	SWAT OFFICER	First the gun. We want to see you toss away your weapon!
M	STU	Shit. I can't.
M	SWAT OFFICER	Freeze where you are! Turn around and keep those hands clasped. Take him.
M	SERGEANT	What is going on with these fucking phone calls?
M	RAMEY	Hold your fire. Let him answer it.
M	SERGEANT	Are you nuts?
M	RAMEY	Let them talk. He's not going anywhere. He's going back inside the booth.
M	STU	Yeah?
M	STU	You got the wrong number. Hang up.
M	STU	Wrong number. Wrong number.
M	VOICE	Aw, relax, Stu. Only yanking your chain. Now can we start over?
M	STU	Those cops won't wait much longer.
M	VOICE	What else can they do? They can't afford to just shoot you like I can. Not with so much media coverage. Not unless you make some stupid aggressive move. The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up.
M	STU	Will you look at that? I must be going out over the network. Bet they're pre-empting usual programming.
M	VOICE	And just think -- if you survive this, your trial will be televised. And you can try and make the world believe I ever existed. I'd be your only defense.
M	STU	How are they gonna prove that I killed anybody when there's no gun?
M	VOICE	They'll plant one. The police aren't above that -- when they're desperate to convict.
M	STU	No, sir. No gun and I walk.
M	VOICE	Don't you think I took that into account? Am I a fool?
M	STU	What do you mean?
M	VOICE	Haven't I considered every eventuality? I knew they'd come and cordon off the block. And that there'd have to be a gun someplace.
M	STU	Where?
M	VOICE	It's a small booth, Stu. Have you checked every inch of it?
M	STU	It's not on the floor.
M	VOICE	Then what's left?
M	STU	Up above.
M	VOICE	Could be. Why don't you reach up there and lift the plastic sheet -- and feel around.
M	STU	If they see me reach for something, they could open fire.
M	VOICE	They could. But you have to know if it's there. Don't you?
M	STU	I totally don't give a shit.
M	VOICE	In a narrow space, tucked just to the left of the fluorescent bulb. You can almost see it outlined if you look closely.
M	STU	It doesn't matter. I know about ballistics. The slug in that dead guy came from your rifle, not any handgun.
M	VOICE	You saw how hollow points splinter on impact. There's nothing much for ballistics to match to. The same make .30 calibre bullets are in that handgun. The prosecution rests.
M	STU	There's no gun up there. I don't see a damn thing.
M	VOICE	Slide your finger up under the plastic and you'll feel the cold metal surface. There are four rounds left in it. Should you decide to shoot your way out.
M	STU	I could never shoot anybody.
M	VOICE	You could shoot me, Stu. You'd do that in a minute if you could.
M	STU	And I'd fucking love it!
M	VOICE	Now you're speaking from the heart. Come on, just lift the partition a few inches and feel what's there for you.
M	STU	I'm not getting my fingerprints on your fucking weapon. What about powder residue? How are they going to explain that to a jury?
M	VOICE	Do you think that'll matter with so many eye witnesses? Do it... or should I re-focus my attention on Kelly?
M	STU	No.
M	VOICE	You carefully distracted me from her before and I let you get away with it. But if you're not going to play fairly -- There she is again. So close I feel like I could touch her.
M	STU	Get off her!
M	VOICE	Then mind me when I speak.
M	STU	Look! I'm reaching up with my left hand. I'm pushing against the partition. It's giving. I'm feeling around with my fingertips. It's filthy up there.
M	STU	I'm -- touching something.
M	VOICE	One of the finest handguns Remington makes. Lightweight, efficient and highly accurate.
M	STU	I'm not picking it up.
M	VOICE	Not right now. But eventually...
M	STU	I wouldn't have a chance.
M	VOICE	I never said you would.
M	STU	I'm not insane.
M	VOICE	But you're getting there. It wouldn't take much.
M	STU	That won't happen.
M	VOICE	You could pull the gun down, shove it in your own mouth and jerk the trigger. That's another option.
M	STU	Why would I do that?
M	VOICE	To please me. And ensure that nothing happens to Kelly. I don't necessarily have to deal with her today in the midst of a crowd of cops. I can take her out any time I like. When she goes to pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in the morning. What is it -- a Jack Russell?
M	STU	Okay. I know you can do it. But don't talk about that. Please.
M	VOICE	I'd rather see you remembered as the gallant gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police -- than as a coward who sucked the barrel. I'm doing your PR for you. Creating a final image that'll endure. The outraged New Yorker who was pushed too far. When some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory, he retaliated. And when the forces of the law closed in, he was defiant... to the end.
M	STU	Like that nerdy sonofabitch who blew those three wiseass kids away on the subway?
M	VOICE	Exactly. Nobody minded that he was a sicko. He was living out a New Yorker's pet fantasy. Can you remember that movie where Peter Finch started screaming 'I'm not taking it anymore!' And everybody picked up on it.
M	STU	'I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking it anymore.'
M	VOICE	That was it. Poor Finch got himself an Oscar for that. But he was dead by then. I mean he really died. Maybe playing that part took too much out of him.
M	STU	'I'm not taking it anymore.' 'I'm not taking it anymore.'
M	VOICE	That's the way! Psyche yourself up. Everybody respects a man who fights back, even if he goes a little berserk in the process.
M	STU	Fighting back. That's what it's about.
M	VOICE	Exactly! We all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses. We all thought of doing that. But only he had the balls. The terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices. Maybe somebody will finally get the message. You can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you. I'm still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned. I could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second. Shall I?
M	STU	I'm on my knees begging you.
M	VOICE	Stand up, Stu. You're embarrassing yourself.
M	VOICE	Stu -- I want you back on your feet facing me. So you can see what I'm going to do to her.
M	VOICE	Be a man, Stuart. Don't let them see you like this. You're an embarrassment to me.
M	SERGEANT	Officer on east side of the street reports subject removed a dark metallic object from his pocket. We better move.
M	RAMEY	Hold all fire until you actually identify a weapon. We're doing this on fucking TV!
M	EMERGENCY OPERATOR	Police. Is this an emergency? Hello? Is someone on the line?
M	STU	You've made your point. Who's going to believe I've got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in a fucking phone booth at 45th and 8th?
M	VOICE	It took you a while to believe it yourself.
M	STU	If you'd put a bullet in that Captain Ramey, it would've been a different story -- but you were too wise to do that.
M	VOICE	Why don't you do it for me? Wave the old captain back over and get him nice and close and then use the handgun on him.
M	STU	Why me? You could pick off any of those cops from your window up there. Like you did that pimp. And that tourist last week. But this time you want me to do your killing for you.
M	VOICE	And you will! To save Kelly.
M	EMERGENCY OPERATOR	Can you speak up, sir? What is your name?
M	VOICE	That's better, Stu. Now turn around so I can see you.
M	STU	This booth. It's my whole world -- shrunk down to four feet by three feet. Not much bigger than the size of a coffin.
M	VOICE	They can put handles on the booth and bury you in it.
M	STU	When I saw you put that bullet into that black dude, I knew you'd never let me out of this phone booth alive.
M	VOICE	You're wasting my time. Reach up and take the gun.
M	STU	Let me see you first. What harm can that do you? You're in one of those windows. I've got to know which one.
M	VOICE	No need for that.
M	STU	Being so far, I could never identify you. I don't even want to.
M	VOICE	What is it then?
M	STU	Don't worry that I'd try to point you out. You'd shut me up with one of your .30 calibre hollow points before I could even raise a finger.
M	VOICE	Why does it matter so much?
M	STU	I want to see that you exist. Like God exists. It's not enough to believe. You want to see him -- just once -- even at a distance.
M	VOICE	And then you'd take the gun down. And use it. We have a deal on that?
M	STU	Show yourself to me and I'll take the gun down. I swear.
M	VOICE	I don't have to make deals. And you're irritating me by trying to negotiate. God doesn't have to prove anything. He just strikes you down when he gets in the mood.
M	STU	Stop! I won't ask to see you anymore.
M	VOICE	I'm glad that's settled. But look who else has showed up?
M	STU	Who?
M	VOICE	I guess she saw the coverage on TV and just couldn't keep away.
M	STU	What are you talking about?
M	VOICE	The 'hotel' just arrived. And a very beautiful little hotel she is. Actually, I'd classify her as more of a motel.
M	STU	Mavis? I don't see her.
M	VOICE	She's too far back behind the police line. But I've got a fine shot at her from up here.
M	STU	You don't even know what she looks like.
M	VOICE	You're in an enviable position now, Stu. You get to choose between them. Tell me which one.
M	STU	I can't.
M	VOICE	Which will it be? Kelly or Mavis? Or should I simply select one?
M	STU	I need time to think...
M	VOICE	You've got to be more in touch with your feelings. You said you love Kelly.
M	STU	I do.
M	VOICE	Then I'm doing you a favor putting you out of the way of temptation.
M	STU	It wasn't Mavis' fault. It was all my fault.
M	VOICE	Then take the third option. Reach above you and pick up the gun.
M	STU	You'll leave them both alone?
M	VOICE	There won't be much point in harming them without you around to impress.
M	STU	I'll do it.
M	VOICE	Let me see you do it.
M	STU	I need one minute. One last minute, please. Can you give me that?
M	VOICE	Don't tell me you're going to say your prayers?
M	STU	Something like that.
M	RAMEY	They should've traced the fucking call by now.
M	SERGEANT	There's something else coming in. A 911 operator says your name was mentioned by somebody that's still on the line. Somebody talking about a phone booth. And a sniper.
M	RAMEY	Patch me through. Hello, this is Captain Edward Ramey. What about that call?
M	EMERGENCY OPERATOR	The line is still open. It's originating from a booth at 45th and 8th.
M	RAMEY	We're there! Can you play me back your recording of the entire call?
M	EMERGENCY OPERATOR	I can't replay the tape while it's still running.
M	RAMEY	Then switch to another machine and play back what you've got.
M	EMERGENCY OPERATOR	It's awful faint. He's not talking directly into the receiver.
M	STU'S VOICE	'Who's going to believe I've got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in some fucking phone booth...'
M	TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN	Got what you wanted. The call's coming from up the street. The Hotel Broadway.
M	RAMEY	Have you got the room?
M	TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN	It's not that easy. Electronic switchboard.
M	RAMEY	Move your SWAT units to the hotel. No... wait. Any movement will alert the sniper. If he sees any of us withdraw, he may panic.
M	SERGEANT	There's another SWAT unit on the way.
M	RAMEY	Intercept them. Divert them to the hotel.
M	SERGEANT	It's done.
M	RAMEY	Send them in from the Forty-third Street side. I don't want any activity the sniper might catch sight of. He's probably high up and facing that booth. He's got to continue to believe our full attention is focused on the man inside -- whoever the hell that poor bastard is. Hello 911 operator, I missed some of that. Run it halfway back and repeat it.
M	STU'S VOICE (REPLAY)	'...Like you did that pimp. And that tourist last week. But this time you want me to do the killing for you...'
M	RAMEY	Jesus... he's a dead man.
M	VOICE	The police seem all excited about something, Stu.
M	STU	Are they? I wasn't looking.
M	VOICE	I can't wait any longer. Say amen, then reach up for the gun. When your hand comes down, I want to see it.
M	STU	I'm too afraid.
M	VOICE	For once, be brave. Surprise yourself.
M	STU	I'm shaking all over.
M	VOICE	Guys in combat situations even shit their pants. But they follow orders.
M	STU	As soon as the cops see a gun, they'll open fire.
M	VOICE	Then I'd advise you to fire first.
M	POLICE SNIPER	Give me the word.
M	VOICE	Hard part's over. Drop your arm and point it like you'd point your finger and squeeze.
M	STU	No. You do it. If you want me dead, then fucking murder me!
M	VOICE	Why must I keep invoking some poor girl's name every time we come to an impasse? I'm focused back on Kelly again. You're obviously not willing to trade your life for hers.
M	STU	I am! I'm doing it!
M	STU	There! You see it? They all see it.
M	STU	Where are you? Damn you!!
M	VOICE	Thanks for such an interesting afternoon.
M	RAMEY	Hello? This is Captain Ramey. Somebody talk to me.
M	SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE	Yeah. We took him out, Captain. Nobody else got hurt.
M	RAMEY	What's his condition?
M	SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE	Critical. The sonofabitch took two. Probably won't survive the ride.
M	RAMEY	Get a statement from him. I'll be right over.
M	MEDIC	Don't try to sit up.
M	STU	What was that?
M	RAMEY	Rubber bullet.
M	MEDIC	You'll have one hell of a nasty welt. Busted rib. Maybe a permanent scar there.
M	STU	It couldn't hurt much more if you really shot me.
M	RAMEY	Somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us.
M	STU	Did you get him?
M	RAMEY	Sure as hell did. Thanks to you.
M	STU	Still alive?
M	RAMEY	Barely.
M	MEDIC	We'll be giving him a hypo for the pain. It'll put him out for a while.
M	STU	It's okay. I'm not really shot.
F	KELLY	I was so afraid. I thought...
M	STU	I thought so, too. But we're going to be alright. Both of us.
F	KELLY	Remember how you swore up and down you'd get me on TV? Well, you did. I already got interviewed on Fox and Channel Eleven and they even want me on A.M. America tomorrow morning.
M	STU	Bet you didn't think I could deliver on that.
M	MEDIC	Will you please let go of him, Miss?
M	STU	No. No hypo. I want to see him first.
M	RAMEY	Relax. The guy's dying.
M	STU	That's why I've gotta talk to him. Please!
M	RAMEY	We'll see.
M	MEDIC	You can ride with him in the ambulance.
M	RAMEY	This is Ramey. Over. This is Ramey. Ten-Four.
M	RAMEY	Shit. Get everybody off this wavelength.
M	RAMEY	Hello. Hello! Pick up! Yeah, it's Ramey again. Can you hold the phone close enough so the perp can listen?
M	COP'S VOICE	He's not saying a word, Captain.
M	RAMEY	He's not about to talk to us. Maybe to him.
M	RAMEY	Forget that. Stand him up. Can you stand?
M	STU	I can try.
M	RAMEY	Help him over here.
M	RAMEY	Here. Speak up.
M	STU	It's me. Do you hear me? Answer me.
M	VOICE	Had to have the last word, Stu.
M	STU	I finally beat your ass. Admit it, you fuck.
M	VOICE	But you'll never forget me. I gave you the most thrilling day of your life. Say thanks.
M	STU	Now you're gonna die, you bastard.
M	VOICE	I lost a lot of blood. Don't you want to donate some for me? Then we'd really be part of each other.
M	STU	Hang on. I can't wait to see you at the hospital. So I can yank your fucking air tube out.
M	VOICE	Wish I could give you that pleasure. You deserve it. ...Only I'm out of time.
M	STU	What's your name? At least tell me who you are.
M	COP'S VOICE	He's gone.
M	RAMEY	Don't worry. We'll find out who he is. And why he picked you.
M	STU	No. You won't. What do you want to bet you won't?
M	STU	I'll spend my whole life trying to figure that out.
M	STU	Gotta sleep now. No phone calls...
