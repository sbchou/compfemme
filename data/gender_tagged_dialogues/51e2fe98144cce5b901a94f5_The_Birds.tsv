M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	MELANIE	Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Hello, Miss Daniels.
F	MELANIE	What do you suppose it is?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know.
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
F	MELANIE	You said three o'clock.
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	I know. Oh, I know. I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
F	MELANIE	Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
F	MELANIE	And he'll talk?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
F	MELANIE	Yes.
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Yes. Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
F	MELANIE	I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Oh. Oh, well, all right.
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
F	MELANIE	Well, all right, but...
M	MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)	Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's. It's past three, you know. Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait.
M	MITCH	I wonder if you could help me.
F	MELANIE	What?
M	MITCH	I said I wonder if you could help me.
F	MELANIE	Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
M	MITCH	Lovebirds.
F	MELANIE	Lovebirds, sir?
M	MITCH	Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
F	MELANIE	Well... yes, sir, there are.
M	MITCH	These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
F	MELANIE	I understand completely, sir.
M	MITCH	As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
F	MELANIE	No, of course not.
M	MITCH	Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
F	MELANIE	I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
M	MITCH	Aren't these lovebirds?
F	MELANIE	No, sir, those are... redbirds.
M	MITCH	The sign says strawberry finches.
F	MELANIE	Yes, we call them that too. Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
M	MITCH	Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
F	MELANIE	Doesn't what make me...?
M	MITCH	All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
F	MELANIE	Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
M	MITCH	I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
F	MELANIE	Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
M	MITCH	I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
F	MELANIE	Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
M	MITCH	Are they moulting now?
F	MELANIE	Some of them are.
M	MITCH	How can you tell?
F	MELANIE	Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
M	MITCH	Yes, I see. About those lovebirds, Miss...
F	MELANIE	Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
M	MITCH	All right. She smiles back.
M	MITCH	All right, may I see one, please?
F	MELANIE	Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.
F	MELANIE	Oh! Ohhhhh!
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the birds is loose!
M	MITCH	Shhh! Shhhh!
F	MELANIE	There we are!
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
M	MITCH	Back into your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels.
F	MELANIE	What did you say?
M	MITCH	I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
F	MELANIE	But how... how do you know my name?
M	MITCH	A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
F	MELANIE	Hey, wait a minute!
F	MELANIE	I don't know you.
M	MITCH	Ahhh, but I know you.
F	MELANIE	How?
M	MITCH	We met in court.
F	MELANIE	We never met in court or anyplace else.
M	MITCH	That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
F	MELANIE	When?
M	MITCH	Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
F	MELANIE	I didn't break that window!
M	MITCH	No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
F	MELANIE	What are you? A policeman?
M	MITCH	I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
F	MELANIE	What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
M	MITCH	Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
F	MELANIE	You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
M	MITCH	Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
F	MELANIE	I think you're a louse.
M	MITCH	I am. Good day. Madam.
F	MELANIE	And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
M	MITCH	I'll find something else. See you in court some day.
F	MELANIE	That... that... who was that?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	I have no idea.
F	MELANIE	Have you got a pencil?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	What? Oh, yes, certainly.
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
F	MELANIE	No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Yes, certainly.
F	MELANIE	Do you have any lovebirds?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
F	MELANIE	How soon?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	Well... well, how soon would you want them?
F	MELANIE	Immediately. Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
M	MRS. MACGRUDER	I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
F	MELANIE	That would be just fine. Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me. No, this is a small one. Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you? Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six. Yes, a California plate. No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office? Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
F	MELANIE	Now. What time tomorrow morning?
M	MAN'S VOICE	Miss...? She stops, distressed.
M	MAN	Is that for Mitch Brenner?
F	MELANIE	Yes.
M	MAN	He's not home.
F	MELANIE	That's all right.
M	MAN	He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
F	MELANIE	Monday?
M	MAN	Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
F	MELANIE	Well, I...
F	MELANIE	Well, where did he go?
M	MAN	Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
F	MELANIE	Bodega Bay? Where's that?
M	MAN	Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
F	MELANIE	Sixty... Oh.
M	MAN	About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
F	MELANIE	Oh.
M	MAN	I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
F	MELANIE	Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
M	MAN	I'm awfully sorry.
F	MELANIE	Oh, shut up!
F	MELANIE	Good morning.
M	CLERK	Morning.
F	MELANIE	I wonder if you could help me.
M	CLERK	Try my best.
F	MELANIE	I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
M	CLERK	Yep.
F	MELANIE	Do you know him?
M	CLERK	Yep.
F	MELANIE	Where does he live?
M	CLERK	Right here. Bodega Bay.
F	MELANIE	Yes, but where?
M	CLERK	Right across the bay there.
F	MELANIE	Where?
M	CLERK	See where I'm pointing?
F	MELANIE	Yes?
M	CLERK (O.S.)	See them two big trees across there?
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	Yes?
M	CLERK (O.S.)	And the white house?
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	That's where the Brenners live.
F	MELANIE	The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
M	CLERK	Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
F	MELANIE	The two kids?
M	CLERK	Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
F	MELANIE	I see. How do I get down there?
M	CLERK	Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
F	MELANIE	The front door. Isn't there a back road I can take?
M	CLERK	Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
F	MELANIE	You see, I wanted to surprise them.
M	CLERK	Mmmm.
F	MELANIE	I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
M	CLERK	Mmmm.
F	MELANIE	It's a surprise, you see.
M	CLERK	Mmmmmm. 'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
F	MELANIE	Where would I get a boat?
M	CLERK	Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
F	MELANIE	Of course.
M	CLERK	D'you want me to order one for you?
F	MELANIE	Thank you.
M	CLERK	What name?
F	MELANIE	Daniels.
M	CLERK	Okay.
F	MELANIE	I wonder if you could tell me...
M	CLERK	Yep?
F	MELANIE	The little girl's name.
M	CLERK	The little Brenner girl?
F	MELANIE	Yes.
M	CLERK	Alice, I think. Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
M	HARRY'S VOICE	What?
M	CLERK	The little Brenner girl.
M	HARRY'S VOICE	Lois!
M	CLERK	It's Alice, ain't it?
M	HARRY'S VOICE	No, it's Lois!
M	CLERK	It's Alice.
F	MELANIE	Are you sure?
M	CLERK	Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
F	MELANIE	I need her exact name, you see.
M	CLERK	That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
F	MELANIE	Yes?
M	CLERK	Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
F	MELANIE	Thank you.
M	CLERK	Yep. Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
F	MELANIE	Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
F	MELANIE	How much for the phone calls?
M	CLERK	It's nothing.
M	ANNIE'S VOICE	Yes? Who is it?
F	MELANIE	Me!
M	ANNIE'S VOICE	Who's me?
F	MELANIE	Miss Hayworth?
F	ANNIE	Yes?
F	MELANIE	I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
F	ANNIE	Yes?
F	MELANIE	The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
F	ANNIE	Cathy?
F	MELANIE	The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
F	ANNIE	That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
F	MELANIE	They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
F	ANNIE	Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place. Did you want to see Cathy about something?
F	MELANIE	Well... not exactly.
F	ANNIE	Are you a friend of Mitch's?
F	MELANIE	No, not really.
F	ANNIE	I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
F	MELANIE	It's a lovely garden.
F	ANNIE	Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time. There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay. Did you plan on staying long?
F	MELANIE	No. Just a few hours.
F	ANNIE	You're leaving after you see Cathy?
F	MELANIE	Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
F	ANNIE	Actually, it's none of my business.
F	ANNIE	I'd better get on my way. Thank you very much.
F	ANNIE	Not at all.
F	ANNIE	Did you drive up from San Francisco?
F	MELANIE	Yes.
F	ANNIE	It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
F	MELANIE	Yes.
F	ANNIE	I guess that's where everyone meets him.
F	MELANIE	Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss Hayworth.
F	ANNIE	Do I? No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid. Or maybe a closed one. Pretty. What are they?
F	MELANIE	Lovebirds.
F	ANNIE	Mmm. Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
F	MELANIE	Thank you.
M	MITCH	That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
F	MELANIE	What made it...
M	MITCH	It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
M	MITCH	Come on, let's take care of that.
M	FISHERMAN	What happened, Mitch?
M	MITCH	A gull hit her.
M	FISHERMAN	A what?
M	MITCH	Come on, we'd better go up to the restaurant.
M	MITCH	Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
M	DEKE	What happened?
M	MITCH	Young woman cut herself.
M	DEKE	Shall I call the doctor?
M	MITCH	I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
M	DEKE	You cut yourself outside, Miss?
M	MITCH	Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
M	DEKE	I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
M	MITCH	I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
M	DEKE	Well, you're the lawyer.
F	MELANIE	What's that?
M	MITCH	Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
F	MELANIE	So you're a lawyer.
M	MITCH	That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
F	MELANIE	Do you practice here?
M	MITCH	No, San Francisco. What are you...?
F	MELANIE	What kind of law?
M	MITCH	Criminal.
F	MELANIE	Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
M	MITCH	Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
F	MELANIE	Only violators and practical jokers.
F	MELANIE	That's right.
F	MELANIE	Ouch!
M	MITCH	I'm sorry. What are you doing up here?
F	MELANIE	Didn't you see the lovebirds?
M	MITCH	You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
F	MELANIE	To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
M	MITCH	What for?
F	MELANIE	To see a friend of mine. Will you please be careful?
M	MITCH	I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
F	MELANIE	Why...
M	MITCH	Yes?
F	MELANIE	Annie. Annie Hayworth.
M	MITCH	Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
F	MELANIE	Yes.
M	MITCH	How do you know Annie?
F	MELANIE	We... we went to school together. College.
M	MITCH	Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
F	MELANIE	Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
M	MITCH	I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
F	MELANIE	Oh, no you don't!
M	MITCH	It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
M	MITCH	Bend your head down. This little Band-Aid won't show.
M	MITCH	So you came up to see Annie, huh?
F	MELANIE	Yes.
M	MITCH	I don't believe you. I think you came up to see me.
F	MELANIE	Why would I want to see you, of all people?
M	MITCH	I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
F	MELANIE	It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
M	MITCH	You like me, huh?
F	MELANIE	I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
M	MITCH	What did it say?
F	MELANIE	None of your business. Am I still bleeding?
M	MITCH	Can't see a thing.
F	MELANIE	I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
M	MITCH	But you were coming up anyway, remember?
F	MELANIE	I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
M	MITCH	Right next to the one you already had.
F	MELANIE	Look, Mr. Brenner... Mitch?
F	LYDIA	I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
M	MITCH	I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
F	LYDIA	A what?
M	MITCH	Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
F	LYDIA	How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what?
M	MITCH	A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
F	LYDIA	Oh. I see.
M	MITCH	For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
F	LYDIA	Across at Brinkmeyer's.
M	MITCH	Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
M	MITCH	After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds. I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
F	LYDIA	You did say birds?
M	MITCH	Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
F	LYDIA	Lovebirds, I see.
M	MITCH	...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
F	MELANIE	Yes, but...
M	MITCH	You are, aren't you?
F	MELANIE	Certainly, but...
M	MITCH	Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
F	LYDIA	Seven o'clock, same as usual.
M	MITCH	I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
F	MELANIE	With... with Annie, of course.
M	MITCH	Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
F	MELANIE	Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
M	MITCH	You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
F	MELANIE	I'm sure.
M	MITCH	Seven o'clock then.
F	MELANIE	Maybe.
M	MITCH	We'll be waiting. How's your head now?
F	MELANIE	It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull hit me, that's all.
F	ANNIE	Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
F	MELANIE	Yes, I did.
F	MELANIE	I was wondering...
F	ANNIE	Yes?
F	MELANIE	That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
F	ANNIE	Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
F	MELANIE	I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
F	ANNIE	Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car?
F	ANNIE	It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
F	MELANIE	I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
F	ANNIE	Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
F	MELANIE	Yes. May I use your phone? I'd like to call home.
F	ANNIE	Why don't you come in then? I was just about to mix a martini.
F	ANNIE	Don't they ever stop migrating?
F	MELANIE	Hi!
F	CATHY	Hi!
F	CATHY	Miss Daniels?
F	MELANIE	Yes?
F	CATHY	They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
F	MELANIE	Well, I suppose...
M	MITCH	Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
F	MELANIE	Famished.
M	MITCH	Dinner's just about ready. We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
F	LYDIA	There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
M	MITCH	I don't know what good that'll do. Chickens won't eat.
F	LYDIA	He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
M	MITCH	Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
F	LYDIA	Whose side are you on?
M	MITCH	I'm simply quoting the law.
F	LYDIA	Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
F	LYDIA	This won't take a minute, Miss Dan... Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner. I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I? Fred, that feed you sold me is no good. The chicken feed. The three bags I brought.
F	LYDIA	Well, it's just no good. The chickens won't eat it. They're always hungry, Fred. I opened one of the sacks when I got home, and I poured it out for them, and they wouldn't touch it. Now you know chickens as well as I do, and when they won't eat, there's just something wrong with what they're being fed, that's all. No, they're not fussy chickens. Who? What's he got to do with it? Fred, I don't care how much feed you sold him. My chickens... He did? Dan Fawcett? Well, that only proves what I'm saying. The feed you sold us is... Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh- huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see him. You don't think there's something going around, do you? No, never. No, Fred, they don't seem sick at all. They just won't eat. Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get over to Dan's farm. Maybe he'll... mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred, thanks.
F	LYDIA	He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
F	CATHY	It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
F	LYDIA	No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
F	CATHY	I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
F	MELANIE	Your brother told me.
F	LYDIA	Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
F	MELANIE	No, not exactly.
F	CATHY	Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
F	LYDIA	Cathy!
F	CATHY	Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it. He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
F	LYDIA	In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
F	CATHY	Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods. He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it? I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
F	MELANIE	Why did he shoot her?
M	MITCH	He was watching a ball game on television.
F	MELANIE	What?
M	MITCH	His wife changed the channel.
F	CATHY	Is smoking fun?
F	MELANIE	Oh, I suppose so.
F	CATHY	Could I have a puff?
F	MELANIE	I don't think your mother would like that.
M	CATHY (O.S.)	Just a little one.
F	CATHY	Why, it's just like air, isn't it? When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
F	MELANIE	I know.
F	CATHY	Are you coming to my party?
F	MELANIE	I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
F	CATHY	Don't you like us?
F	MELANIE	Darling, of course I do!
F	CATHY	Don't you like Bodega Bay?
F	MELANIE	I don't know yet.
F	CATHY	Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
F	MELANIE	I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
F	CATHY	If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
F	CATHY	You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out where I'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother is going to say she has a headache and would I mind very much if she took me home. Then, when we get back here, all of the kids'll jump out! Won't you come? Won't you please come?
F	MELANIE	I don't think so, Cathy.
F	LYDIA	She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
M	MITCH	Yes, very.
F	LYDIA	And certainly pretty.
M	MITCH	Yes.
F	LYDIA	How long have you known her?
M	MITCH	I told you. We met yesterday.
F	LYDIA	In a bird shop.
M	MITCH	Yes.
F	LYDIA	She was selling birds.
M	MITCH	No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
F	LYDIA	But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
M	MITCH	Mother, where did you go to law school?
F	LYDIA	Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. She's very rich, isn't she?
M	MITCH	I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
F	LYDIA	You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
M	MITCH	I know, Mother.
F	LYDIA	She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
M	MITCH	Yes, Mother.
F	LYDIA	Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
M	MITCH	I know, Mother.
F	LYDIA	It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
M	MITCH	Mother?
F	LYDIA	Yes?
M	MITCH	I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
F	LYDIA	Well... So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
M	MITCH	I know exactly what I want, Mother.
M	MITCH	You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
F	MELANIE	Oh, yes.
F	MELANIE	Will I be seeing you again?
F	MELANIE	San Francisco's a long way from here.
M	MITCH	I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
F	MELANIE	How does Mother know what I like to do?
M	MITCH	I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
F	MELANIE	Oh. That. Rome.
M	MITCH	Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
F	MELANIE	In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
F	MELANIE	Without any clothes on?
F	MELANIE	With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...
M	MITCH	You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
F	MELANIE	I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
M	MITCH	The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
F	MELANIE	Yes, but...
M	MITCH	...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
F	MELANIE	Yes.
M	MITCH	...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
F	MELANIE	Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
M	MITCH	Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
F	MELANIE	No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.
M	MITCH	So you didn't go to school together.
F	MELANIE	No.
M	MITCH	And you didn't come up here to see her.
F	MELANIE	No.
M	MITCH	You were lying.
F	MELANIE	Yes, I was lying.
M	MITCH	Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
F	MELANIE	I wrote the letter.
M	MITCH	What did it say?
F	MELANIE	It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
M	MITCH	But you tore it up.
F	MELANIE	Yes.
M	MITCH	Why?
F	MELANIE	Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
M	MITCH	Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
F	MELANIE	I told you what happened in Rome!
M	MITCH	Do you expect me to believe...?
F	MELANIE	I don't give a damn what you believe!
M	MITCH	I'd still like to see you.
F	MELANIE	Why?
M	MITCH	I think it could be fun.
F	MELANIE	That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
M	MITCH	It is for me.
F	MELANIE	But not for me.
M	MITCH	What do you want ?
F	MELANIE	I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
F	ANNIE	Miss Daniels? Is that you?
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	Yes.
F	ANNIE	Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
F	MELANIE	No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
F	ANNIE	Would you like some brandy?
F	MELANIE	If you have some, I'd...
F	ANNIE	I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
F	MELANIE	No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
F	ANNIE	All right.
F	MELANIE	Thank you.
F	ANNIE	It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
F	ANNIE	Well, how'd your evening go?
F	ANNIE	Did you meet Lydia?
F	ANNIE	Or would you rather I changed the subject?
F	MELANIE	I think so.
F	ANNIE	How do you like our little hamlet?
F	MELANIE	I despise it.
F	ANNIE	Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
F	MELANIE	Where are you from originally, Annie?
F	ANNIE	San Francisco.
F	MELANIE	How'd you happen to come here?
F	ANNIE	Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
F	ANNIE	Look, I see no reason for being coy about this. It was Mitch Brenner.
F	ANNIE	I guess you knew that, anyway.
F	MELANIE	I suspected as much.
F	ANNIE	You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
F	MELANIE	Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
F	ANNIE	Isn't there? Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
F	MELANIE	What do you mean?
F	ANNIE	I think I'll have some of that, too. I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know. And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
F	MELANIE	When was this?
F	ANNIE	Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.
F	MELANIE	Different?
F	ANNIE	With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
F	MELANIE	A trifle.
F	ANNIE	Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
F	ANNIE	When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
F	MELANIE	And what had you done?
F	ANNIE	Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
F	MELANIE	Then what was it?
F	ANNIE	Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
F	MELANIE	Then why did she object to you?
F	ANNIE	Because she was afraid.
F	MELANIE	Afraid you'd take Mitch?
F	ANNIE	Afraid I'd give Mitch.
F	MELANIE	I don't understand.
F	ANNIE	Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
F	MELANIE	Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
F	ANNIE	No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see. She's only afraid of being abandoned.
F	MELANIE	Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
F	ANNIE	She already has a daughter.
F	MELANIE	What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
F	ANNIE	I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
F	MELANIE	I see.
F	ANNIE	So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
F	MELANIE	Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
F	ANNIE	You get straight to the point, don't you?
F	MELANIE	I'm sorry. Forgive me.
F	ANNIE	No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
F	MELANIE	I did.
F	ANNIE	Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time. That's the first reason.
F	MELANIE	And the second?
F	ANNIE	I wanted to be near Mitch. It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway. You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
F	ANNIE	Hello? Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't asleep. What is it? Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, hold on. It's Mitch. For you.
F	ANNIE	He's waiting.
F	MELANIE	Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, thank you. No, no trouble at all. I simply followed the road. It's a very bright night. What? Oh. Well, there's no need to apologize. I can understand... Well... That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry. I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get back to San Francisco. No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but... I see. I see. Well, if you really... All right. Yes, I'll be there. Good night, Mitch.
F	MELANIE	He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.
F	ANNIE	I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
F	MELANIE	It seems so pointless. I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day. My luggage.
F	ANNIE	Pretty. Did you get that at Brinkmeyer's?
F	MELANIE	Do you think I should go?
F	ANNIE	That's up to you.
F	MELANIE	It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
F	ANNIE	Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
F	MELANIE	Yes.
F	ANNIE	Then go.
F	MELANIE	Thank you, Annie.
F	ANNIE	Who can that be at this hour? Who is it? Is someone there?
F	ANNIE	Is anyone there?
F	MELANIE	Look.
F	ANNIE	Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
F	MELANIE	But... it isn't dark, Annie. There's a full moon.
F	MELANIE	I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
M	MITCH	I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
F	MELANIE	I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
M	MITCH	Cheers.
F	MELANIE	Cheers.
F	MELANIE	What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
M	MITCH	Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
F	MELANIE	Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
M	MITCH	You have a job?
F	MELANIE	I have several jobs.
M	MITCH	What do you do?
F	MELANIE	I do different things on different days.
M	MITCH	Like what?
F	MELANIE	On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
M	MITCH	Helping travelers.
F	MELANIE	Yes.
F	MELANIE	And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley. That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
M	MITCH	What about Thursdays and Fridays?
F	MELANIE	On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch. I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
M	MITCH	And Fridays? What do you do then?
F	MELANIE	Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.
M	MITCH	I'm glad you do.
F	MELANIE	Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
M	MITCH	What?
F	MELANIE	I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced. She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
M	MITCH	What'll it say?
F	MELANIE	You'll think me very bold, sir.
M	MITCH	No, tell me.
F	MELANIE	That's silly, isn't it? Teaching a bird to shock my aunt. That's just silly and childish. Maybe I ought to go join the other children.
F	ANNIE	All right then, here we go. Once! Twice! Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!
M	LITTLE BOY (O.S.)	Look! Look!
F	CATHY	No touching allowed!
M	MITCH	Are you all right?
F	MELANIE	Yes.
F	ANNIE	That's the darnest thing thing I've ever seen in my life.
F	LYDIA	Are they gone?
M	MITCH	They're gone, Mother.
F	LYDIA	Well... well, is everyone all right?
M	MITCH	I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
M	GIRL #3	Did you see them? They were hawks!
M	GIRL #4	They were bigger than hawks!
F	ANNIE	Children, they were only seagulls.
F	CATHY	They must have been after the food, Mother.
M	MITCH	They didn't touch anything.
F	ANNIE	Well, they're gone now, so... so let's... Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't you, Cathy?
M	GIRL #2	Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?
M	MITCH	You look a little shaken.
F	MELANIE	I... I am. Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now... Last night? What do you mean?
F	MELANIE	A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch... what's happening?
M	MITCH	I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
F	MELANIE	No, I have my things in the car.
M	MITCH	Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
M	MITCH	Do you want some mustard with this?
M	MELANIE (O.S.)	No, thank you.
F	CATHY	Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
M	MITCH	She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
F	CATHY	Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
M	MITCH	Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
F	CATHY	What's the matter with them?
F	LYDIA	What's the matter with all the birds?
F	LYDIA	Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm sure Miss Daniels wants to get on her way.
F	CATHY	I think you ought to stay the night, Melanie.
F	CATHY	We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
M	MITCH	That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
F	MELANIE	If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
F	LYDIA	Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
M	MITCH	Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
F	CATHY	Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
F	LYDIA	Yes, I did.
F	CATHY	Just listen to them!
M	MITCH	Some cream?
F	MELANIE	I'll get it.
F	MELANIE	Mitch...
F	MELANIE	Mitch!
M	MITCH	Get outside! Run!
M	MITCH (O.S.)	Mother!
M	MITCH	Cathy, get some matches!
F	MELANIE	Mitch! The curtains!
F	CATHY	It's working! The fire's working!
M	MALONE	That's a chimney swift, all right.
M	MITCH	We know what it is, Al.
M	MALONE	Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
M	MITCH	Not by the thousands.
M	MALONE	No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. Did you have a light burning or something.
M	MITCH	Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
M	MALONE	'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.
M	MITCH	What are we going to do about it, Al?
M	MALONE	I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
M	MITCH	Well... Well... these birds attacked us.
M	MALONE	What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
M	MITCH	All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
M	MALONE	My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
M	MALONE	Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there.
M	MITCH	These birds were...
M	MALONE	What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it.
F	LYDIA	Tell him about the party.
M	MITCH	That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
M	MALONE	Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?
M	MITCH	Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
M	MALONE	Yeah. Were the kids bothering them or something? 'Cause sometimes they'll do that, you know. If you make any kind of disturbance near them, they'll just come after you. I seen that plenty of times myself.
F	LYDIA	The children were playing a game, Al. Those gulls attacked without...
M	MALONE	Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty strong word, don't you think? I mean, birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason, you know what I mean? The kids just probably scared them, that's all.
F	LYDIA	These birds attacked!
M	MALONE	Well, what would you like me to do, Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on any suspicious birds in the area? Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't it?
M	MITCH	Does this room look silly?
M	MALONE	No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that. Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years. You want some help cleaning up?
M	MITCH	I can handle it myself.
F	MELANIE	I'll take Cathy up to bed.
M	MITCH	Are you staying?
F	MELANIE	I think I should, don't you?
F	MELANIE	I'll get my things from the car. Do you want to walk with me, Cathy?
M	MALONE	Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
M	MITCH	Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
M	MALONE	Goodnight, Lydia.
M	MALONE	Sure is peculiar, I got to say that for it.
M	LYDIA'S VOICE	Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to drop Cathy off now.
M	MITCH'S VOICE	Okay.
M	LYDIA'S VOICE	I'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm. Do you need anything in town?
M	MITCH'S VOICE	No.
F	MELANIE	Mitch?
F	MELANIE	Mitch?
F	MELANIE	Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.
M	MITCH	I wanted to change my shirt.
M	MITCH	It smelled of the fire.
F	MELANIE	It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now. I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
M	MITCH	Really? Tell me about it.
F	MELANIE	It's an uprising.
M	MITCH	Of birds?
F	MELANIE	Certainly, of birds.
F	MELANIE	It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
M	MITCH	Growing a beard...
F	MELANIE	Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
M	MITCH	So they united.
F	MELANIE	Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
M	MITCH	Well, they'll go along with anything.
F	MELANIE	Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
M	MITCH	Hear!
F	MELANIE	Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
M	MITCH	Hear, hear!
F	MELANIE	And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
M	MITCH	Take wing!
F	MELANIE	You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
M	MITCH	What it was, probably...
F	MELANIE	Mmm?
M	MITCH	They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
F	MELANIE	With my little sparrow leading team.
M	MITCH	It's so damn quiet out there.
F	MELANIE	It was like that yesterday.
M	MITCH	What do you mean?
F	MELANIE	After the gulls attacked.
M	MITCH	I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
F	MELANIE	It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
M	MITCH	No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
M	MITCH	...waving his little wings...
F	MELANIE	They were angry, Mitch. They came out of the chimney in fury. I had the feeling they wanted each and every one of us dead.
M	MITCH	Melanie, Melanie...
F	MELANIE	I'm frightened, Mitch.
M	MITCH	No, no...
F	MELANIE	I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
M	MITCH	Melanie...
F	MELANIE	...everything I know.
F	MELANIE	Oh damn it, why did you have to walk into that shop?
F	LYDIA	Dan?
F	LYDIA	Dan?
F	LYDIA	Hi, there!
F	LYDIA	Is Mr. Fawcett home?
M	FARMHAND	I think so, ma'm. His missus is in Santa Cruz, but he ought to be here.
F	LYDIA	Have you seen him this morning?
F	LYDIA	Thank you!
F	LYDIA	Here, chick, chick, chick, chick. Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
F	LYDIA	Dan?
F	LYDIA	Dan? Are you home?
F	LYDIA	Dan?
F	LYDIA	Dan?
F	LYDIA	Dan? Are you in there?
M	MITCH	What is it?
M	MITCH	That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while. Will you be all right here?
F	MELANIE	Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
F	MELANIE	Be careful. Please.
M	LYDIA (O.S.)	Mitch?
F	MELANIE	No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
F	LYDIA	Oh, thank you.
F	LYDIA	Where's Mitch?
F	MELANIE	Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
F	LYDIA	Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
F	MELANIE	He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
F	LYDIA	Then he saw.
F	MELANIE	He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
F	LYDIA	What good will they do?
F	LYDIA	Do you think Cathy's all right?
F	MELANIE	What?
F	LYDIA	Cathy. At the school.
F	MELANIE	Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
F	LYDIA	Do I sound foolish to you?
F	MELANIE	No.
F	LYDIA	I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face. They have such big windows at the school. All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
F	MELANIE	Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
F	LYDIA	I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
F	LYDIA	I lost my husband four years ago, you know. It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone. I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep. Do you think Cathy's all right?
F	MELANIE	Annie's there. She'll be all right.
F	LYDIA	I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children. When Frank died... You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
F	MELANIE	Yes.
F	LYDIA	I wish I could be that way.
F	LYDIA	I miss him. You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember. I miss talking to him. Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch... ...Mitch has his own life. I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
F	MELANIE	Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
F	LYDIA	No. No... don't go yet. I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
F	MELANIE	Why, Mrs. Brenner?
F	LYDIA	Because my son is... My son seems to be fond of you. And I... I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
F	MELANIE	Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
F	LYDIA	Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
F	MELANIE	And if you don't?
F	LYDIA	Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
F	MELANIE	I think it might also matter to Mitch.
F	LYDIA	Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do. I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man. But... You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone. I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset. I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
F	MELANIE	Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
F	LYDIA	I wish I were stronger. Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
F	MELANIE	Would you like me to go for her?
F	LYDIA	I couldn't ask you to.
F	MELANIE	I don't mind, really.
F	LYDIA	Would you? I'd feel so much better.
F	MELANIE	I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
F	LYDIA	Melanie?
F	LYDIA	Thank you for the tea.

F	ANNIE	We're not going outside until we quiet down. Ralph? Did you hear me?
F	ANNIE	All right now.
F	ANNIE	wh...?
F	MELANIE	Outside.
F	MELANIE	We've got to get the children out of here. These big windows... there's no way to board them up.
F	ANNIE	Quiet down, children! Quiet down!
F	ANNIE	Miss Daniels wants to see how we conduct ourselves during a fire drill. I'd like you to...
M	CHILDREN	A fire drill? This is our play period, Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz! Etc.
F	ANNIE	I'd like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be.
F	ANNIE	We're going to go out of the school now. Those of you who live nearby can go directly home. I want the rest of you to go down the hill, all the way to the hotel. Do you understand?
M	CHILDREN	All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do we...?
F	ANNIE	I want you to go as quietly as you can, not a sound, until I tell you to run. And then I want you to run as fast as you can. Does everyone understand? All right. John, would you lead the class, please?
F	MELANIE	Hurry!
F	MELANIE	Daddy, there were hundreds of them. No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying to tell you this as calmly as I know how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy. Just now. Not... fifteen minutes ago.
F	MELANIE	At the school. No, I don't. Just a minute. What's the name of the school?
M	DEKE	Just the Bodega Bay School. Help you, Mrs. Bundy?
M	MRS. BUNDY	I need some change, Mr. Carter.
F	MELANIE	The Bodega Bay School. Could you turn that down, please?
F	MELANIE	I don't know how many children. Thirty or forty. Yes.
F	MELANIE	No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
M	MRS. BUNDY	There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
F	MELANIE	They're different, Daddy. Thank you. I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them. Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right. No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope... I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
M	MRS. BUNDY	They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
F	MELANIE	Thank you. Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
M	DEKE	In the book right here, Miss.
M	DEKE	I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
M	MRS. BUNDY	I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
F	MELANIE	I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
M	MRS. BUNDY	Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
F	HELEN	Three Southern fried chicken, Sam. Baked potato on all of them.
F	MELANIE	Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please? Yes, I'll wait.
M	MRS. BUNDY	...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
M	DEKE	Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Impossible.
F	MELANIE	Mitch? I'm glad I caught you. Something terrible has happened.
M	DRUNK	It's the end of the world!
F	HELEN	What's this about the school?
M	DEKE	Bunch of crows attacked the school, Helen. It's the end of the world. "Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
F	HELEN	The Lord's not destroying anything, Jason.
M	DRUNK	"In all your dwelling places, the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be laid waste!" Ezekiel, Chapter six.
F	HELEN	"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink."
M	DRUNK	Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of the world.
F	MELANIE	Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
M	MRS. BUNDY	I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
F	MELANIE	These weren't a few birds.
M	DEKE	I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
M	MRS. BUNDY	The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
M	SHOLES	How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
M	MRS. BUNDY	Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
M	SHOLES	The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
F	MELANIE	Have you had trouble with gulls?
M	SHOLES	One of my boats did last week.
M	DEKE	This young lady got hit by a gull only Saturday.
M	SAM'S VOICE	Pick up the chicken.
F	HELEN	Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was crows. Deke, I'm still waiting for those Bloody Marys!
M	DEKE	Coming right up!
M	WOMAN	Could you ask them to lower their voices, please? They're frightening the children.
M	LITTLE GIRL	Timmy has a canary.
F	HELEN	That's nice. Are you Timmy?
M	LITTLE BOY	My cousin is Timmy.
M	SAM'S VOICE	A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized one of my boats. Practically tore of the skipper's arm.
F	HELEN	You're scaring the kids. Keep it low.
M	DEKE	You're scaring me, too. Are you trying to say all these... That sounds impossible, Sebastian.
M	SHOLES	I'm only telling you what happened to my boat.
M	MRS. BUNDY	The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
F	MELANIE	What were the crows after at the school?
M	MRS. BUNDY	What do you think they were after, Miss...?
F	MELANIE	Daniels. I think they were after the children.
M	MRS. BUNDY	For what purpose?
F	MELANIE	To... To kill them.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Why?
F	MELANIE	I don't know why.
M	MRS. BUNDY	I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
M	MRS. BUNDY	Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
F	MELANIE	No one called it a war!
M	SALESMAN	Scotch, light on the water.
M	MRS. BUNDY	You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
F	HELEN	Are you finished here, Sebastian?
M	SHOLES	Let me have some apple pie, Helen. Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
F	HELEN	One apple pie! You want more coffee?
M	SHOLES	No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
M	SALESMAN	Your captain should have shot at them.
M	SHOLES	What?
M	SALESMAN	Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are. If you ask me, we should wipe them all out. World would be better off without them.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Birds?
M	SALESMAN	Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
M	MRS. BUNDY	We need them.
M	SALESMAN	Not if they're starting a war.
M	MRS. BUNDY	They are incapable of organized warfare!
F	MELANIE	Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
M	MRS. BUNDY	I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
F	MELANIE	Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
M	MRS. BUNDY	Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
F	MELANIE	I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
M	SALESMAN	Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
M	MRS. BUNDY	That would hardly be possible.
M	DEKE	Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
M	MRS. BUNDY	Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
M	SALESMAN	Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
M	MRS. BUNDY	...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
M	DRUNK	It's the end of the world!
M	DEKE	Well, we seem to have more than our share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy. Maybe this young lady's right. Maybe they've all gone crazy.
F	HELEN	Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
M	SHOLES	No. Here's fine.
F	HELEN	Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
M	DEKE	Coming.
F	HELEN	Are we running a business here -- or a bird sanctuary?
M	SHOLES	Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Of course.
M	SHOLES	Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
M	DRUNK	Cockroaches! Urghh!
M	WOMAN	Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.
M	BOY	Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?
M	SHOLES	Maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this. Admittedly, a few birds acted strangely. That's no reason to believe...
F	MELANIE	This isn't a few birds! I keep telling you that! These are gulls and swifts and crows and...
M	MRS. BUNDY	And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
F	MELANIE	Maybe! Is it impossible?
M	MRS. BUNDY	Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable. Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
M	SHOLES	We couldn't. You're right, Mrs. Bundy.
M	WOMAN	Excuse me, may I have a check, please?
F	HELEN	Is everything all right, ma'am?
M	WOMAN	Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the road.
M	SAM	What's the matter? Something wrong out here?
M	DEKE	Nothing's wrong.
M	SAM	All this shouting.
M	MRS. BUNDY	We're fighting a war, Sam.
M	SAM	A war? Against who? Did the Russians...?
M	SHOLES	Against birds.
M	WOMAN	I'm glad you all think this is so amusing. You've frightened my children half out of their wits.
M	BOY	I'm not scared, Mommy.
M	WOMAN	Keep quiet. If that young lady saw an attack on the school, why won't you believe her?
M	SAM	What attack? Who attacked the school?
M	WOMAN	Birds did. Crows! And you're all sitting around here debating! What do you want them to do next? Crash through that window?
M	LITTLE GIRL	Mommy!
M	WOMAN	Quiet! Why don't you all get home? Lock your doors and windows! Put on your coats, children! What's the fastest road to San Francisco?
M	DEKE	The freeway, ma'am.
M	WOMAN	Where do I get it?
M	SALESMAN	I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
M	WOMAN	Then let's go. Now!
M	SALESMAN	I haven't finished my drink.
M	WOMAN	Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
M	BOY	I can't find my scarf.
M	WOMAN	Look in your sleeve!
M	MITCH	Melanie?
M	MITCH	I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
F	MELANIE	At Annie's house. She's all right.
M	SAM	Al, why aren't you over there where the attack was?
M	MALONE	Because I just got back from Dan Fawcett's place, that's why.
M	MITCH	He was killed last night. By birds.
M	MALONE	Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
M	MRS. BUNDY	What are the facts, Mr. Malone?
M	MALONE	Santa Rosa police think it was a felony murder. They think a burglar broke in and killed him.
M	WOMAN	Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
M	SALESMAN	Take it easy, lady. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
M	DRUNK	"Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow or read, yet your heavenly father feeds them."
M	WOMAN	I'll never feed another bird as long as I live!
M	SALESMAN	Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
M	WOMAN	Can't you please finish your drink?
M	MRS. BUNDY	That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
M	SALESMAN	They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
M	MRS. BUNDY	The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
M	WOMAN	I'm leaving! Are you coming?
M	SALESMAN	All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks. It's the end of the world.
M	SHOLES	Well, I'd better get back to the cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?
M	DEKE	Let's see. Scallops and coffee...
M	MITCH	Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.
M	MITCH	Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
M	SHOLES	No one ever said you were, Mitch.
M	MITCH	I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Ignore what? The bird war?
M	MITCH	Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, the bird plague, you can call it what you want to, they're out there massing someplace and they'll be back, you can count on that!
M	MRS. BUNDY	Ridiculous!
M	MITCH	Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home and polish your binoculars?
M	SAM	Go on, Mitch.
M	MITCH	If we don't do something now, if we don't get Bodega Bay on the move...
M	SHOLES	Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
M	MITCH	Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
M	SHOLES	No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
M	MITCH	It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
M	SHOLES	I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...
M	MITCH	Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
M	SHOLES	Help how? What do you want to do?
M	MITCH	I'm not sure, but...
M	SHOLES	If you don't even know what you want to do...
F	MELANIE	Listen to him, please.
M	SAM	You listen to him, Sebastian!
M	MITCH	I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
M	SHOLES	How?
M	MITCH	Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
M	DEKE	We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
M	MITCH	We'll make our own fog.
M	SHOLES	How do you plan to do that?
M	MITCH	With smoke.
M	MALONE	There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
M	MITCH	We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
M	DEKE	What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
M	MRS. BUNDY	Birds are not bad!
M	SHOLES	How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
M	MITCH	Can we go on living here otherwise?
M	SAM	It's worth a try, Sebastian.
F	MELANIE	Look!
M	DEKE	Gulls!
M	MITCH	They're back!
M	SHOLES	They're only the usual... What are you...
M	MITCH	Stay back in here.
F	MELANIE	Mitch...! Mitch!
M	WOMAN	Why are they doing it?! Why are they doing it...?!
M	MRS. BUNDY	why the birds could have gone berserk like this. This information should
M	MITCH	I think they're going.
M	MITCH	I think it's safe to get out now.
F	MELANIE	Don't let's take any chances.
M	MITCH	We've got to get Cathy.
M	MELANIE'S VOICE	Look... the crows again.
F	MELANIE	Careful, Mitch. The crows may be back in the play yard.
F	MELANIE	Mitch! Don't!
F	MELANIE	Please! Get Cathy! Let's get out of here!
F	MELANIE	Mitch, you can't leave her out there.
F	MELANIE	You drive, Mitch.
F	MELANIE	I don't think they're coming.
F	CATHY	On our way back from taking Michele home... we... we heard the explosion and went outside to... see what... what it was. All at once the... the birds were everywhere. All at once. She... she pushed me inside and... they covered her. Annie. She pushed me inside.
F	MELANIE	The town looks clear.
M	MITCH	The bay doesn't.
F	MELANIE	How long have they been gathering there?
M	MITCH	The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
F	MELANIE	I keep thinking of Annie.
M	MITCH	It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
F	MELANIE	Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
M	MITCH	It may not be last week again for a long long time.
F	MELANIE	Look. They're still coming.
M	MITCH	Do you want to try your father again?
F	MELANIE	I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
M	MITCH	Have we still got power?
F	MELANIE	Yes. I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
M	LYDIA (O.S.)	Mitch! I'm getting something on the radio!
F	LYDIA	I can't get any of the local stations. I think this is San Francisco.
M	ANNOUNCER	...would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project. A vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning.
M	ANNOUNCER	Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area. The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals unquote. In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town. On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that...
M	MITCH	Is that all? ...drew a standing ovation for the President. The Chief Executive, in discussing our relation to Europe and the rest of the world community said: "These various elements of our foreign policy lead as I have said to a single goal --
M	MITCH	We're going to need more wood for the fire. We can't let it go out.
M	ANNOUNCER	The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states. This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future -- a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age. We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our lifetime. But the quest is the great adventure of our century. We sometimes chafe at agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility. In assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did when I first took office. For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of...
F	LYDIA	Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
M	MITCH	I got them all, Mother.
F	LYDIA	When do you think they'll come?
M	MITCH	I don't know.
F	LYDIA	If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
M	MITCH	That's a chance we have to take.
F	LYDIA	Maybe we ought to leave.
M	MITCH	Not now. Not while they're massing out there.
F	LYDIA	When?
M	MITCH	I don't know when. We'll see what...
F	LYDIA	Where will we go?
M	MITCH	I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in.
F	LYDIA	What happens when we run out of wood?
M	MITCH	I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
F	LYDIA	You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
F	CATHY	Mother!
F	LYDIA	If your father were here...
M	MITCH	Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...
F	LYDIA	I'm sorry, Mitch.
M	MITCH	Let's get the wood. Why don't you make us all some coffee, Mother?
F	MELANIE	Where are they heading?
M	MITCH	Inland.
F	MELANIE	Santa Rosa?
M	MITCH	Maybe.
M	MITCH (O.S.)	Come on. Let's get this wood in.
F	MELANIE	That's the last of it.
F	LYDIA	Did you close the door?
F	MELANIE	And locked it.
F	CATHY	Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
F	LYDIA	No!
F	CATHY	Mom, they're in a cage!
F	LYDIA	They're birds!
M	MITCH	Let them stay in the other room.
F	CATHY	Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.
M	MITCH	I don't know, honey.
F	CATHY	Why are they trying to kill people?
M	MITCH	I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
F	LYDIA	Mitch...
M	MITCH	Shhh. Shhh.
F	CATHY	I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I want to throw...
F	MELANIE	I'll go with you.
F	MELANIE	When will they stop?
M	MITCH	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
F	MELANIE	What time is it?
M	MITCH	Almost two a.m.
F	MELANIE	You must be exhausted.
M	MITCH	How about you?
M	MITCH	I wonder if Cathy fed them.
M	MITCH	You should have left when you wanted to.
M	MITCH	You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
F	MELANIE	I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
M	MITCH	The power.
F	MELANIE	Mitch...
M	MITCH	Wait here. Don't move.
M	MITCH	We'd better light some of those lamps.
F	MELANIE	No... wait. Hold me.
M	MITCH	I think they're easing off.
F	MELANIE	Mitch?
F	MELANIE	Mitch?
M	MITCH (O.S.)	Melanie!
M	MITCH (O.S.)	Melanie, open the door!
M	LYDIA (O.S.)	Mitch, get her out of there!
M	MITCH (O.S.)	Melanie!
M	MITCH	Mother, get a rope!
F	LYDIA	Oh, my God, look at her!
M	MITCH	Get a rope!
M	MITCH	Mother! Hurry!
M	MITCH	Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
F	CATHY	Is she all right?
F	MELANIE	I'm... I'm....
M	MITCH	Just lie there and keep still.
F	LYDIA	Let me do that, Mitch.
M	MITCH	I can handle it.
F	LYDIA	I know you can. But I'd like to.
F	MELANIE	Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
F	LYDIA	Shhhh. Shhhh.
F	MELANIE	Please.
F	LYDIA	I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
M	MITCH	You're doing fine.
F	LYDIA	I mean. I want to...
F	CATHY	Listen!
F	LYDIA	They're gone. God have mercy, they're gone.
M	MITCH	They're gone. The same pattern.
F	LYDIA	But they'll be back.
M	MITCH	We won't be here.
F	LYDIA	Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
M	MITCH	I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
F	LYDIA	We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
M	MITCH	We have to try it. We can't stay here. Melanie needs help. Mother, the house won't take another attack.
F	LYDIA	If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
M	MITCH	They won't be.
F	LYDIA	If they are?
M	MITCH	We'll worry about that when we get there.
F	LYDIA	I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
M	MITCH	What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
F	LYDIA	I started to say... inside...
M	MITCH	You don't have to.
M	MITCH	I think we'd better get started.
F	CATHY	May I take them, Mitch?
F	CATHY	They haven't harmed anyone.
F	LYDIA	Take them.
M	MITCH	We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.
M	MITCH	Be careful with that door.
F	MELANIE	Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
M	MITCH	We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. Are you ready?
M	MITCH	All right. Here we go.
M	MITCH	Shhh. Shhhh.
F	CATHY	Mitch, let's turn back.
M	MITCH	Shhh. Shhhhh.
F	LYDIA	Mitch!
F	MELANIE	Can we turn back?
M	MITCH	I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
F	MELANIE	Then go ahead, Mitch.
M	MITCH	Here we go.
F	MELANIE	Mitch!
F	LYDIA	Dear God... dear God... please, please, what have we done? Please. Can't they leave us alone? LEAVE US ALONE!
F	LYDIA	We're losing them.
F	CATHY	Mitch? Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
M	MITCH	I think they'll be all right, honey.
M	MITCH	It looks... it looks clear up ahead.
