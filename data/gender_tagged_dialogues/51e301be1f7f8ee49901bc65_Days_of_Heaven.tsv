M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M		if I ever seen a tit, this here's a tit. You understand? Candy. My kid sister could do this one. Pure fucking candy'd melt in your hand. Don't take brains. Just a set of rocks. I told you this already.
M		you told me it was going to snow in the winter, I'd go out and bet against it. You know? is nothing, nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea.
M		all right, fine. Why should I be doing favors for a guy that isn't doing me any favors? I must be losing my grip. got to give it to you, though. Couple of guys look like you just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens. You ever get laid?
M		a lot of talk, I mean? 'Cause I'm beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up for a couple of bucks. It's clean, and you know what you're in for. the Collector's GANG swaggers around in the alley behind a textile plant. ONE of them has filed his teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them. ANOTHER wears big suspenders. and Bill appear to know one another.
M		Billy, you made a mistake. You made somebody mad. Nothing personal, okay? It's just gotta be done. You made a mistake. Happens in the best of families.
M		paid you everything I have. Search me. The rest he gets next week. what happens if I don't do this? I gotta leave town?
M		could do something, you know. You guys wanta do something to me, I know who to tell about it. You guys ought to think about that.
M		maybe already did something. Maybe that's why you're here, on account of you already done something.
M		haven't done anything.
M		you're all right, Billy. TEETH got nothing to worry about.
M		it out, Billy, all right? You know what can happen to a guy that doesn't wanta do what people tell him? You know. So don't give us a lot of trouble. You're liable to get everybody all pissed off. a busy man, checks his watch. NEW ANGLE puts his hand on the ground. Sam drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his gang. Bill sobs with pain. and Steve drag a safe by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill. Blackie walks behind.
M		know what I'm doing with my end? Buy a boat. Get that? I had a boat. I had a nice apartment, I had a boat. Margie don't like that. We got to have a house. "I can't afford no house," I said. She says, "Sell the boat." I didn't want to sell my boat. I didn't want to buy the house. I sell the boat, I buy the house. Nine years we had the house, eight of them she's after me, we should get another boat. I give up.
M		as always, I do all the work, you gripe about it. FOUR POLICEMEN surprise them from ambush. Bill lets go of the rope and starts to run. Steve does not give up immediately, however, and they shoot him down. Bill picks up Steve's gun and fires back. Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon bring to heel. The FOURTH stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he attends to Steve.
M	TIGHT ON STEVE	badly wounded, is about to die. Get out of here.
M		love you so much. Why didn't you run. Don't die. dies. Bullets kick up dust around him. He takes off running. One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder. a beautiful woman in her late twenties, attends to Bill's wounds in a big vaulted sewer. Her sister URSULA, a reckless girl of14, stands watch. shot the shit out of him. My brother. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. still, or I can't do anything.
M		love you, Abby. You're so good to me. Remember how much fun we had, on the roof... and Abby flirt on the root of a tenement, happily in love. The city stretches out behind them. lies shivering with fever. Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth. Ursula rolls paper flowers for extra change. even when you were sick and I was in the mill. works in the glow of a blast furnace. He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the workers. A pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his appearance. He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any better--like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim hopes for a better way of life. won't let you go back in the mill. People die in there. I'm a man, and I can look out for you. a railroad spur outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen from the tenders. going west. Things gotta be better out there. POLICEMAN, looking for Bill, roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live. Suddenly Bill runs out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full of water. you do? shrugs, then hits him again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun. Abby calls Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of their laundry off a clothesline. hop a freight train. CREDITS run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters. Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway. A blind man hawks stale bread. Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant. Laundry hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes. Police look for a thief under a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look. The CREDITS end. and Bill sit atop a train racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle.
M		like the sunshine. does. laugh. She is dressed in men's clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap. They are sharing a bottle of wine.
M		never wanted to fall in love with you. asked you to. draws her toward him. She pulls away.
M		the matter? A while ago you said I was irresistible. I still am.
M		was then. pushes her nose up against his chest and sniffs around.
M		playing mousie again?
M		love how nice and hard your shoulders are. And your hair is light. You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night.
M		love it when you've been drinking.
M		not greasy, Bill. You have any idea what that means?
M		of. share the boxcar with a crowd of other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill gestures out at the landscape. at all that space. Oweee! We should've done this a long time ago. It's just us and the road now, Abby. all still together, though. That's all I care about. train slows down to take on water. The hands jump off. Each carries his "bindle"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on hand to greet them.
M		room! Oweee! Give me a chance and I'm going to dance! struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known that he was born to greater things.
M	NEW ANGLE	comes upon a BIG MAN whose face is covered with blood.
M		very good. Where you from, mister?
M	MAN	
M		to see the other guy. helps him to his feet and dusts him off. A TOUGH walks up.
M		doing this shit? keep it moving.
M		yeah? Who're you? Tough hits Bill across the head with his ax handle.
M		is Morrison. looks around to see whether Abby has seen this. She hasn't. He walks dizzily off down the tracks. NEW ANGLE takes Abby by the arm. happened to your ear? is a sultry beauty--emancipated, full of bright hopes and a zest for life. Her costume does not fool the men. Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently. FOREMEN of the surrounding farms wait by their wagons to carry the workers off. A flag pole is planted by each wagon. Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a blackboard. a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a megaphone. In the background a NEWCOMER to the harvest talks with a VETERAN.
M		Four more and I'm leaving. much you paying?
M		can make three dollars a day, he wants to work.
M		you kidding? mills around. They have no choice but to accept his offer. steps up. Benson takes her for a young man.
M		ever sacked before? nods. Note: the following seven lines of dialogue between the NEWCOMER and the VETERAN runs concurrent with the previous six lines of dialogue between Benson and Bill and Abby. In the original script they are typed in two columns running side-by-side down the page. the pussy up there? good. Where you from? the pussy up there? guys tough out here? so tough. How about up there? that? year. waves her on. Abby nods at Ursula.
M		making a mistake, you pass this kid up.
M		on. snaps his fingers at her. Bill climbs up ahead of the women. Anger makes him extremely polite.
M		don't need to say it like that. ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first. wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a "bonanza" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill. wagons pass under a large arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished kingdom. Goats peer down from on top. looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows. the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, "The Belvedere" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all. white picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell. drift over the hills like boats on the ocean. Bill shouts at the nearest one. Beevo! TIGHT ON CHUCK ARTUNOV, the owner--a man of great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor--stands on the front porch of the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals. drops the hands off at the dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a ceiling of exposed joists. Ursula sees Chuck watching them. place is that? owner's. Don't none of you go up around his place. First one that does is fired. I'm warning you right now. the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn. and Bill slip off to share a cigarette. Ursula tags behind. lifts a big rock. Abby applauds. Ursula kneels down behind Abby pushes him over backwards. lands in a straw pile. TIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL takes Abby by the hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her across the chest. giggles her consent. He crushes her in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets her go. She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication. looks deeply into Abby's eyes by the light of a lantern that night. They have made a shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood like children.
M		all I've got, Abby. No, really, everything I ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you.
M		know. laugh. He bends to kiss her. She pulls away.
M		I think you don't like men.
M		individuals? Very seldom. kisses him lovingly. sun peers over the horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.
M		that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth." harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer.
M	TIGHT ON WHEAT	looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper. He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard. sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness: snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk. pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix. OTHER FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES SIGNALMAN with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work. and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or "shocks." cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb. is well turned out, in a boater and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a picnic. too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring. While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker. plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat. follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it. Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged.
M	CHUCK AND BENSON	shivers through the clouds along the horizon. Chuck looks concerned. Benson consults a windsock. miss us. must be having trouble over there, though. passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields. One so beautiful is unprecedented.
M		didn't know we had any women on.
M		thought she was a boy. Should I get rid of her? MONTAGE COOK stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole. Ursula bounds through the wheat blowing a horn. consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air. faces black with chaff, the hands fall out in silence. They shuffle across the field toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid being spiked by the stubble. COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses. The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby. is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.
M		sister keep you warm at night? throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt. and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon. Demoralized, Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water. Bill inspects them anxiously. They are swollen and cracked from the morning's work.
M		ran a stubble under my nail.
M		you ever learn how to take care of yourself? I told you to keep the gloves on. What can I do if you don't listen? presses her wrists against his cheek, ashamed that he can do nothing to shield her from such indignities. In the b.g. a MAN with a fungo bat hits flies to SOME MEN with baseball gloves.
M		can't keep on like this. else can we do? nods at the others.
M		if they can, I can too. bunch? Don't compare yourself to them. flexes her fingers. They seem lame.
M		drop off this weak. I can make enough for us both. It was a crime to bring you out here. Somebody like you. now, what I'm doing, I'm just dragging you down. you should go back to Chicago. We've got enough for a ticket, and I can send you what I make. seems a little surprised when she does not reject this idea out of hand. Perhaps he fears that if she ever did go back, he might never see her again. the matter? begins to cry. He takes her in his arms.
M		know how you feel, honey. Things won't always be this way. I promise. ABBY AND BILL - CHUCK'S POV men knock out their pipes as Benson's whistle summons them back to their stations. tockl Tick tock! Nothing moving but the clock! pulls Abby to her feet. He sees the Dutchman he fought with and shoots him the finger. better be careful. him? He's just a. sack of shit. it! He's liable to see you.

M	TIGHT ON CHUCK	looks on. Something about her captivates hint, not so much her beauty--which only makes her seem beyond his reach--as the way she takes it utterly for granted. work goes on through the afternoon. The pace is stern and incessant, and for a reason: a storm could rise at any moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up. A series of dissolves gives the sense of many days passing. moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up.Animals--snakes and gophers, rabbits and foxes--dart through the field into the deep of the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the reapers make their rounds.

Thousands of shocks stretch out in the distance. Benson comes up behind her, making a spray of the stalks that she missed.

A few stay up late to shoot dice in the back of a wagon. and Bill have laid their bedrolls out by a stack away from the others. A fire burns nearby. Abby look at the stars. Bill shines his shoes. The straw is fragrant as thyme.

Despite Benson's warning a team of Percherons breaks free. Threshing, the separating of the wheat from the chaff, has begun. foot belts connect the tractors to the separating machines, huge rattletrap devices that shell the wheat out at deafening volume. Benson tosses bundles down the hissing maw, squirts oil into the gears, tightens belts, chews out a MAN who's sliced a hand on the driveshaft, etc. works on the straw pile at the back of the machine, in a soft rain of chaff, spreading it out with a pitchfork. helps stoke the tractor with coal and water.

SERIES OF ANGLES - FESTIVITIES - DUSKU are feats of strength and prowess as workers from the many fields of the bonanza join to celebrate the harvest home: boxing, wrestling, barrel jumping, rooster bouts, bear hugs, "Crack the Whip" and nut fights. Two tractors, joined by a heavy chain, vie to see which can outpull the other. Chuck lifts the back wheel of the separator off the ground; Benson replies by holding an anvil at arm's length; they tease each other about showing off. A GYMNAST does flips.

BILL AND ABBY - DUSKI finds Abby sitting off by herself, wanting no part of the festivities. This is the first time since their arrival in Texas we have seen her wearing a dress.
M		Jim, look at this. My first ice cream in six months. And the lady even asks do I want sprinkles on top, thank you. Big, deep dish of ice cream. You couldn't pay me to leave this place, Got you one, too. You should've heard the line I had to give her, though. Oowee!

Chuck hesitates, but only to suggest he still has the prudence he long since has abandoned. work for them, too. bonfire burns like a huge eye in the vat of the prairie night. The band strikes up a reel. and Abby lead the dancing off, as though to celebrate their agreement. Their giant shadows dance with them. Soon the other harvesters join in. TIGHT ON BILL - DUSKU watches Abby dance--it almost seems in farewell to their innocence. After a moment he turns off into the night.I effigy is held over the flame at the end of a pole until it catches fire. The harvesters prance around in the dark, trading it from hand to hand. MUSICIANS, drunk and happy, bow their hearts out. TIGHT ON BILL - DAWN the others pursue their merriment, Bill walks the fields by himself, trembling with grief and indecision. Dawn is breaking. The eastern sky glows like a forge. Suddenly he comes upon a wolf. He catches his breath. wolf stares back at him for a moment, then turns and pads off into the stubble. the next morning the HARVESTERS wander by the hundreds down to the railroad tracks to catch a train for the North, where the crops are just now coming into maturity. A subtle feeling of sadness pervades the group. Bill gives his sword cane away to a MAN who seems to have admired it. The MAN offers him money, but he declines it. says goodbye to her favorite, a redhead named JOHN. She is hoarse, as always. don't you come with us?
M		won't let me. So when am I going to see you again? in Cheyenne. nods okay. They both know they will never see each other again. On a sudden impulse she gives him a love note. this? takes it back immediately, but he snatches it away from her and, after a brief, giggling scuffle, hops aboard the train, now picking up speed. Ursula runs along behind, cursing and throwing rocks at him.

M		just about done with this. what's next? nothing else you want done? that I can think of. Not right now. Carter, the housekeeper, steps out on the porch and pours a bucket of milk into a cream separator. about the cream? takes care of that. nods at Miss Carter, who conspicuously lets the screen door clap shut as she goes back inside. She misses no opportunity to express her disdain for these newcomers. and Benson are the only employees seen at the Belvedere. Several dozen others have stayed on after the harvest but they keep to their quarters down at the dorm.
M		mean I'm done for today? else might come up. truth, Chuck does not want to see Abby degraded by menial labor, considering her more a guest than an employee. They look at each other. Abby does not know quite what to make of him

M		they could make stick. problem has always been not having the education. I bullshitted way into school. They gave me a test. It was ridiculous. I got in fights. Ended up paying for a window. They threw me out. Don't blame them either. Still, I wanted to make something of myself. I mean, guys look at across a desk, you know what they're thinking. So I went in mill. Couldn't wait to get in there. Begin at seven, got to have a smile on your face. Didn't work out, though. No matter what you do, sometimes just don't go right. It gets to you after a while. It gives you that feeling, "Oh hell, what's the use?" dad told me, forget what the people around you are doing. You got enough to worry about without considering what somebody else does. Otherwise you get fouled up. He used to say (tapping his temple) you got is this." Only one day you wake up, find you're not the smartest guy in the world, never going to come up with the big score. I really believed when I was growing up that somehow I would. I worked like a bastard in that mill. I felt all right about it, though. I felt that somewhere along the line somebody would see I had that special gleam. "Hey, you, come over here." So then I'd go. are silent for a moment.

She turns on her heel and leaves.U sits down feeling misunderstood and abused. Does she think all this pleases him? out for a stroll with Abby and Ursula, shows them a fairy ring--a colony of mushrooms growing in a circle thirty feet across.
M		heard you farmers were big and dumb. You aren't so big. Where do they learn how to? so darling! Can you eat them? nods. Abby snaps the mushrooms off flush at the ground. The music underscores this moment. She smiles at Chuck as she eats the dark earthy flesh. pitch rocks at a post and exchange intimacies. Abby has grown more lively.

A cottonwood tree rises against the cold blue sky, still as a statue. TIGHT ON BOOK - FLASHBACK hand turns the pages of a book from Chuck's childhood. The text and VOICE reading it are in Russian, the picture of Russian wood folk and animals. father rushes around marking off his property with stakes. ten years old, scours up the blade of a scythe.

BILL'S POV AND TIGHT ON BILL the distance he sees Chuck put his arm on Abby's waist and whisper something in her ear. This intimacy rubs him the wrong way. He gives his clubs to Ursula and starts after them. finds them in the kitchen. Chuck goes into the other room to look for something. Abby lifts the cigarette out of Bill's mouth, takes a drag and does a French inhale. Bill kisses her. all bad, are they?
M		met a few I was wrong on, then. they hear Chuck's footsteps. They pull back just in time, Abby returning the cigarette to him behind her back. They chat as though nothing had happened.

He snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back. they walk into the living room. ever see anybody out here? after harvest. often do you get into town? or twice a year.

M		not? I'm just seeing what kind of material it's made of. spoonful. walks around absentmindedly, inspecting Chuck's things, stealing whatever catches his fancy. A book, a paperweight, a bell--things he does not really want and has no use for. His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse these little sins. Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a candlestick. the candlestick? shrugs. Bill gives Abby a cold look and goes outside. a strange one.
M		he named his shoes like they were pets. It was a joke, I guess. drops the candlestick down the well, stands for a moment, then punches the bucket with his fist. He looks up. Benson has seen him. the saplings thrash in the wind. wakes up with a gasp. the matter? had a dream. about? something after you? forgot it already. camera falls through the clouds as though in a lost fragment of Abby's dreams. sulks by the barn.

It just might work out better is all. Less friction. believe me, then. You shouldn't. But why not check it out, sir? Hire a detective in Chicago. It won't cost much. What's there to lose? brow darkens as Benson goes on. For a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke up. Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge it.
M		talking about my wife. so Chuck, too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme. I better pack my things. turns and walks off. Chuck watches him go, ashamed at himself. What has this man done but a friend's duty? sits at the dresser in the master bedroom. Bill walks in through the door and tries Chuck's hat on for size.

M		didn't come back to make trouble for you. I guess we were fooling other to think it could last. I mean, What was I offering youanyhow? A ride to the bottom. Looking at you now, in the right clothes and everything, I see how crazy I was and--well, I understand. It's okay. I sort of cut my own throat, actually. eyes close and her legs give in. Bill lets her go and backs off a step in surprise. She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance. TIGHT ON BILL taken by surprise, goes up and kneels down beside her. He looks to see that she is okay. He picks a fox-tail out of her hair. Her dress has worked up toward her knees. He pulls it back down. He wants to caress face but hesitates.

He kisses her neck and leads her toward the front door.
M	CRANE TO CHUCK	camera rises to the uppermost story of the Belvedere. Chuck has seen them. Hot tears leap to his eyes. Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such intimacies between them. Now it all looks different. CHUCK'S POVS (HIGH ANGLES) looks around at his estate--his barn, his auto, his great house and his granary. None of them is any consolation now. Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in some time long past. notices Chuck watching her outside the bedroom door.

M		been looking for you. I have to take off again, real soon here, and... puts a hand on Bill's shoulder, stopping him. They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on. Bill seems puzzled. walks out into the deep of his fields. The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in. He sits down and rests his head against a powerless to think. The wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads. puts his hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a wounded animal. He could not himself quite say what it is that he knows. that afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the bonanza. We do not see where they come from. They seem to appear out of nowhere, unnoticed. Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn. Chuck lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed.

They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own. by little they gather in numbers. Ursula first sees one on the drainboard. She swats it with a newspaper. Others sprout up. One by one she picks them up with a tongs and drops them into the stove. This method too slow. She begins to use her fingers. She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she understands this is futile. At last claustro-phobia seizes her. She spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight. the bedroom overhead, Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another. She jumps out of bed and goes to the window. The locusts pelt against the pane like shot. She throws the bolt. Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass. She jumps back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in. They are free to enter. they are everywhere: on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of clothing. Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration. TIGHT ON CHUCK - SLOW MOTION asleep in the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion. His hair is seething with them. hits the bonanza.

When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry bareness. vanes of the wind generator begin gently to stir. Little by little the wind picks up. A dust devil spins across the yard. The grass lists by the well. A power line moans. the sun dips below the horizon, the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a procession of Army ants. The roar of their wings is deafening. The air hisses and pops with their electric frenzy.

A MAN with an abacus keeps track of what each is owed. SAME FIELDS - NIGHT wind has picked up.

M		you doing? Watch it! What're you, crazy? There's a chance, don't you see? goes to his horse. Bill grabs him by the sleeve. Does he really mean to set the fields on fire? Chuck pushes him aside. Bill, frantic, turns to the others for support.

Suddenly Bill turns and takes off running. Chuck swings at him with the lantern. Bill escapes behind the building wall of flame that springs up between them. whirr of the locusts stops for a moment--they seem at times to have a collective mind--then, just as mysteriously, resumes. Chuck! leaps on his horse. She tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot. Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his stirrup. He eludes them and rides off after Bill, leaving a slash of flame behind him in the grain. They tear off their coats to swat it out, in vain--already it stretches a hundred yards.
