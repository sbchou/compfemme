M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	First Draft	"We each owe a death, there are no exceptions..."
M	WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)	You love your sister? You make any noise, know what happens?
M	BRAD	Old fuck.
M	PAUL	Oh, my...
M	BRAD	Out for a little stroll, Paulie?
M	PAUL	Let go...
M	BRAD	What's with this poncho you got on, huh? This isn't yours.
M	PAUL	I got it off the wall there. There's a whole row of them.
M	BRAD	But not for you, Paulie, that's the thing. Those are for the staff.
M	PAUL	I just borrowed it. Don't see what harm it does.
M	BRAD	It's not about harm, it's about rules. You probably don't think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore, but that's just not true.
M	PAUL	I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
M	BRAD	You got no business up in those woods anyway, especially in the rain. What if you fall and bust a hip, huh? Who you think's gonna have to hoss your sorry old bacon back down here? Me, that's who.
M	PAUL	You're hurting me!
M	BRAD	What do you do up there, anyway? You're too old to go jerk off, so what do you do?
M	PAUL	Nothing. I just walk, that's all, I like to walk!
M	BRAD	Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see.
M	ELAINE (O.S.)	Paul?
F	ELAINE	I saw you coming back, thought you'd like some tea. Are you coming in?
M	PAUL	Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting. About the weather. I think we're through now.
M	BRAD	Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em you're having senile delusions. Who you think they'll believe?
M	PETE	Why we always watch this crap?
M	ELDERLY LADY #1	It's interesting.
M	PETE	Interesting? Bunch'a inbred trailer trash, all they ever talk about is fucking...
F	ELAINE	We should report him.
M	PAUL	That might just provoke him all the more, make things worse for everybody.
F	ELAINE	It's not everybody he has it in for, Paul. It's you. What did you do to provoke him in the first place? Nothing. He's just an abusive bully, and should be made to stop.
M	PAUL	Ellie, please...
M	ELDERLY LADIES	...no, the Movie Classic channel is further down...past the Home Shopping...keep going...
M	ELDERLY LADY #2	Oh! This is wonderful...
M	FRED ASTAIRE	Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my heart beat so that I can hardly speak...
F	ELAINE	Paul? What is it?
F	ELAINE	Paul...my God...
M	ORDERLY	What is it? What's wrong?
M	PAUL	It's okay...I'll be okay...
M	BRAD	S'matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo- hoo? Something nasty happen?
F	ELAINE	Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly fine without your help, thank you.
M	PAUL	I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you, whether you want it to or not. It's silly.
F	ELAINE	Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?
M	PAUL	I haven't spoken of these things in a long time, Ellie. Over sixty years.
F	ELAINE	Paul. I'm your friend.
M	PAUL	Yes. Yes you are.
M	PAUL	I ever tell you I was a prison guard during the depression?
F	ELAINE	You've mentioned it.
M	PAUL	Did I mention I was in charge of death row? That I supervised all the executions?
M	PAUL	They usually call death row the Last Mile, but we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded limes. We had the electric chair then. Old Sparky, we called it. I've lived a lot of years, Ellie, but 1935 takes the prize. That was the year I had the worst urinary infection of my life. That was also the year of John Coffey, and the two dead girls...
M	BRUTAL	Paul? Prisoner.
M	PAUL (O.S.)	Christ. Gimme a minute.
M	BRUTAL	You all right in there?
M	PAUL (O.S.)	For a man pissing razor blades.
M	BRUTAL	You should'a took the day off, gone to see the doctor.
M	PAUL	With a new arrival? You know better. Besides, it's not as bad as it was. I think it's clearing up.
F	DEL	New boy coming in, boss?
M	PAUL	Never you mind, Del, you just keep your nose quietly on your business.
M	BRUTAL	Damn, they're riding on the axle. What'd they do, bust the springs?
M	BRUTAL	Paul? You might wanna reconsider getting in the cell with this guy?
M	PAUL	Why's that?
M	BRUTAL	He's enormous.
M	PAUL	Can't be bigger than you.
M	PERCY	Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!
M	PAUL	Jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell's he yelling about?
M	PERCY	Dead man walking!
M	PERCY	Dead man walking! Dead man--
M	PAUL	Percy, that's enough.
M	BRUTAL	You sure you wanna be in there with him?
M	PAUL	Am I gonna have trouble with you, big boy?
M	PAUL	Percy. They're moving house over in the infirmary. Why don't you go see if they could use some help?
M	PERCY	They got all the men they need.
M	PAUL	Why don't you just go make sure? I don't care where you go, Percy, as long as it's not here at this very moment.
F	DEL	OWW, GOD, HE BUS' MY FINGERS!
M	PERCY	Wiped that grin off your shitpoke face, didn't I
M	PAUL	Goddamn it, Percy! Get the hell off my block!
F	DEL	Oww, damn, boss, he done bus' my fingers for true...
M	PAUL	We'll get it looked at, Del, now keep yourself quiet like I said!
M	PAUL	If I let Harry take those chains off you, you gonna be nice?
M	PAUL	Your name is John Coffey.
M	COFFEY	Yes, sir, boss, like the drink, only not spelt the same.
M	PAUL	So you can spell, can you?
M	PAUL	My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr. Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr. Stanton...those gentlemen there. This isn't like the rest of the prison. It's a quiet place, we like to keep it that way.
M	COFFEY	It weren't me making all the noise, boss.
M	PAUL	You having a joke on me, John Coffey?
M	COFFEY	No, sir.
M	PAUL	Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you. If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day.
M	We might even play some music on	the radio from time to time. Questions?
M	COFFEY	Do you leave a light on after bedtime?
M	COFFEY	Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes. If it's a strange place.
M	PAUL	It's pretty bright in here all night long. We keep half the lights burning in the corridor.
M	COFFEY	Cor'der.
M	PAUL	Right out there.
M	COFFEY	Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to take it back, but it was too late.
M	PAUL	Dean, run Delacroix up to the infirmary and see if his fingers are broken.
M	BRUTAL	Course they're broken, I heard the damn bones crack. Goddamn Percy.
M	HARRY	You hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in?
M	PAUL	How could I miss it, Harry? The whole prison heard.
M	BRUTAL	You'll probably have to answer for sending him off the Mile. He's gonna cause you trouble over this, you mark me.
M	PAUL	I'll chew that food when I have to. Right now I wanna hear about the new inmate...aside from how big he is, okay?
M	BRUTAL	Monstrous big. Damn.
M	PAUL	Seems meek enough. Looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute.
M	HARRY	Imbecile or not, he deserves to fry for what he done. Here...
M	HARRY	...make your blood curdle.
M	KLAUS	WHAT? GOD SAKES, WHAT?
F	MARJORIE	THE GIRLS! THE GIRLS ARE GONE!
M	HOWIE	Papa! Papa, look! The blood!
M	KLAUS	Oh my God.
M	KLAUS	GODDAMN IT, WOMAN, GET ON THE PHONE NOW! YOU TELL 'EM WE HEADED WEST! MIND WHAT I'M SAYING! WEST, Y'HEAR?
F	MARJORIE	Central! Central, are you on the line? Oh, God, please, somebody took my little girls...
M	McGEE	I WANT ALL THE WEAPONS UNLOADED, Y'HEAR? TAKE OUT YOUR SHELLS, I WON'T HAVE A MAN SHOT BY ACCIDENT TODAY! BOBO, WHERE THEM DOGS?
M	KLAUS	Oh, Lord, this belongs to my Katie...
M	PAUL	Jesus.
M	McGEE	Mister.
M	McGEE	Mister? Can you hear me? You have a name?
M	COFFEY	John Coffey. Like the drink, only not spelt the same.
M	McGEE	What happened here, John Coffey? You want to tell me that?
M	COFFEY	I couldn't help it. I tried to take it back, but it was too late.
M	McGEE	Boy, you are under arrest for murder.
M	HAL	I interrupt?
M	PAUL	I'm just about done.
M	PAUL	How's that pretty gal of yours?
M	HAL	Melinda's not so well, Paul. Not so well at all. Got laid up with another headache yesterday. Worst one yet. She's also developed this weakness in her right hand.
M	PAUL	Doctor still think it's migraines?
M	HAL	I'll be taking her up to Indianola next day or so for some tests. Had X-rays and the like. She is scared to death. Truth to tell, so am I.
M	PAUL	If it's something they can see with an X-ray, maybe it's something they can fix.
M	HAL	Maybe.
M	HAL	This just came in. D.O.E. on Bitterbuck.
M	PAUL	You didn't come all the way down here just to hand me a D.O.E.
M	HAL	No. I had an angry call from the state capital about twenty minutes ago. Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block.
M	PAUL	It is.
M	HAL	I'm sure you had reason, but like it or not, the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew, and his name happens to be Percy Wetmore. I need to tell you how this lays out?
M	PAUL	Little Percy called his aunt and squealed like a schoolroom sissy. He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance? Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.
M	HAL	I didn't hear that part. I'm sure she didn't either.
M	PAUL	The man is mean, careless, and stupid. Bad combination in a place like this. Sooner or later, he's gonna get somebody hurt. Or worse.
M	HAL	You and Brutus Howell will make sure that doesn't happen.
M	PAUL	Easy enough to say. We can't watch him every minute, Hal.
M	HAL	Stick with it. May not be much longer. I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge.
M	PAUL	The mental hospital?
M	HAL	Administration job. Better pay.
M	PAUL	Then why's he still here? He could get that application pushed through...hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants.
M	PAUL	Tell you what I think. I think he just wants to see one cook up close.
M	HAL	Well, he'll get his chance then, won't he? Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on. In the meantime, you'll keep the peace.
M	PAUL	Of course.
M	HAL	Thank you, Paul.
M	PAUL	You give Melinda my love, okay? I bet that X-ray turns out to be nothing at all.
F	JAN	Paul?
M	PAUL	Hey, you. Music too loud?
F	JAN	No. There's just this big empty spot in the bed where my husband usually sleeps.
M	PAUL	He said to tell you he's having a little trouble with that tonight.
F	JAN	Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is that what's got you up?
M	PAUL	Yeah, that. Things.
F	JAN	Things.
M	PAUL	Got a new inmate today. Big, simple-minded fella.
F	JAN	Do I want to hear what he did?
M	PAUL	No. One sleepless member of this family's enough. The things that happen in this world. It's a wonder God allows it.
F	JAN	Why don't you come to bed? I've got something to help you sleep, and you can have all you want.
M	PAUL	Don't I wish. I've still got something wrong with my waterworks, I don't want to pass it on.
F	JAN	You see Doc Sadler yet?
M	PAUL	No, because he'll want me to take sulfa tablets and I'll spend the rest of the week puking in every corner of my office. It'll run its course all by itself, thank you very much for your concern.
F	JAN	Poor old guy...
M	BRUTAL (O.S.)	Paul? Dean?
M	BRUTAL	I guess the legislature loosened those purse-strings enough to hire on a new guard. Look again. He's right there.
M	PAUL	He's doing a cell check.
M	DEAN	It ain't normal for a mouse to come up on people that way. Maybe it's rabid.
M	BRUTAL	Oh, my Christ. The big mouse expert. The Mouse Man. You see it foaming at the mouth, Mouse Man?
M	DEAN	I don't see its mouth at all.
M	DEAN	Aw, Brutal, no! We'll be hip-deep in mice around here...
M	BRUTAL	I just wanna see what he'll do. In the interests of science, like.
M	DEAN	He's in the damn restraint room. You know he's gonna be chewing the padding out of walls and making himself a nice little nest.
M	PAUL	All right. Let's get the damn mouse.
M	COFFEY	Saw me a mouse go by.
M	PAUL	It was a dream. Go back to sleep.
M	COFFEY	Weren't no dream. It was a mouse all right.
M	PAUL	Can't put anything over on you.
M	PAUL	Dean, watch the door. He tries to get past you, whack him.
M	DEAN	Brutal or the mouse?
M	BRUTAL	Har har, Mouse Man.
M	PAUL	You let him get past you.
M	DEAN	No I didn't, I was here all the time!
M	BRUTAL	Then where the hell is he?
M	BRUTAL	Three grown men. Outsmarted by a mouse.
M	DEAN	Well, bright side is, all this commotion probably scared him off for good.
M	PAUL	Yeah, that's right. That's the last we'll see of him...
M	PAUL	You little son of a bitch.
M	HARRY	Well, I'll be damned. There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged. I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.
M	BILL	That's a goddamn mouse.
M	HARRY	Yeah. Brute said he was in here last night begging for food, came right up to the desk.
M	BILL	My ass. Give him some room, Percy, see what he does.
M	HARRY	Brave little bastard, gotta give him that.
M	BILL	Here, lemme try.
M	BILL	Maybe he's full.
M	HARRY	Maybe he knows you're just a floater. Gotta be an E Block regular to feed the E Block mouse, don'cha know...
M	HARRY	I was just kidding ab--
M	PERCY	FUCK!
M	PERCY	I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DISEASED HEAD OFF, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT!
M	HARRY	Percy met your mouse.
M	PERCY	It's in here somewhere! I'm gonna squish the little son of a bitch!
M	BRUTAL	Percy, we already tried that--
M	PERCY	What? Whad'ja say?
M	BRUTAL	I said--
M	BRUTAL	--uh, knock yourself out. Hope you nail the bastard.
M	BRUTAL	Gosh. Ain't in there, huh? Don't that beat the mousie band?
M	PAUL	Percy. You want to think about what you were doing just now.
M	PERCY	I know what I was doing. Trying to get the mouse. You blind?
M	HARRY	You also scared the living crap out of me and Bill. And them.
M	PERCY	So what? They aren't in cradle- school, case you didn't notice... ...although you treat them that way half the time.
M	BRUTAL	We don't scare 'em any more than we have to, Percy. They're under enough strain as it is.
M	PAUL	Men under strain can snap. Hurt themselves. Hurt others. That's why our job is talking, not yelling. You'll do better to think of this place like an intensive care ward in a hospital--
M	PERCY	I think of it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in. That's all. Anybody doesn't like it can kiss my ass. How's that sit?
M	PERCY	Try it. You'll be on the bread lines before the week is out.
M	PAUL	We all know who your connections are, Percy... ...but you ever threaten a man on this block again, we're all gonna have a go. Job be damned.
M	PERCY	Big talk. You done?
M	PAUL	Get all this shit back in the restraint room. You're cluttering up my Mile.
M	COFFEY	Saw me a mouse go by.
M	PAUL	Arlen? Your daughter and her family are here.
M	PAUL	Let's move. I want at least two rehearsals before he gets back.
M	TOOT	Sittin' down, sittin' down, rehearsing now! Everybody settle!
M	PAUL	Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.
M	TOOT	I'm steppin' forward, I'm steppin' forward, I'm steppin' forward...
M	PAUL	Is his head properly shaved?
M	DEAN	No, it's dandruffy and it smells.
M	PAUL	I'll take that for a yes. All right, Arlen, let's go.
M	TOOT	I'm walkin' the Mile, I'm walkin' the Mile, I'm walkin' the Mile...
M	TOOT	I'm prayin', I'm prayin', I'm prayin'. The Lord is my shepherd, so on an' so forth...
M	PAUL	Toot, you have to wait till I tell you to pray. Okay, pray.
M	TOOT	Still prayin', still prayin'...
M	HARRY	Paul, we're not gonna have some Cherokee medicine man in here whoopin' and hollerin' and shaking his dick, are we?
M	PAUL	Well, actually--
M	TOOT	Still prayin', prayin', gettin' right with Jesus...
M	HARRY	Do it quietly, you old gink!
M	PAUL	As I was saying, I don't believe they actually shake their dicks, Harry. Be that as it may, Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian, so we got Reverend Schuster coming in.
M	DEAN	Oh, he's good. Fast, too. Doesn't get 'em worked up.
M	PAUL	On your feet, Toot. You've prayed enough for one day.
M	TOOT	Gettin' to my feet, walkin' again, walkin' on the Green Mile...
M	PERCY	What do I do?
M	PAUL	Watch and learn.
M	TOOT	Sittin' down, sittin' down, takin' a seat in Old Sparky's lap...
M	TOOT	Gettin' clamped, gettin' clamped, gettin'--ow, shit, watch the skin!
M	BRUTAL	Roll on one.
M	VAN HAY	"Roll on one" means I turn the generator up full. You'll see the lights go brighter in half the prison...
M	BRUTAL	Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state.
M	Do you have anything to say before	the sentence is carried out?
M	TOOT	Yeah! I want a fried chicken dinner with gravy on the taters, I want to shit in your hat, and I got to have Mae West sit on my face, because I am one horny motherfucker!
M	PAUL	Shut up, Brutal. That goes for everybody. I want quiet in here. Toot, another remark like that, I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real.
M	BRUTAL	It was pretty funny.
M	PAUL	That's why I don't like it. Tomorrow night we're doing this for real. I don't want somebody remembering a stupid joke like that and getting going again. Ever try not laughing in church once something funny gets stuck in your head. Same goddamn thing.
M	BRUTAL	Sorry, Paul. You're right. Let's keep going. Harry...
M	PERCY	What's with the sponge?
M	VAN HAY	You soak it in brine, get it good and wet. Conducts the electricity directly to the brain, fast like a bullet. You don't ever want to throw the switch on a man without that.
M	BRUTAL	Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead, in accordance with the state law. God have mercy on your soul. Roll on two.
M	VAN HAY	And that's that.
M	TOOT	Now I'm fryin'! Fryin'! Geeaaah! Fryin' like a done tom turkey!
M	BRUTAL	One of the witnesses showed up a day early.
M	PAUL	All right, let's go again and do it right this time! Get that idiot out of the chair...
M	BITTERBUCK	You think if a man sincerely repents on what he done wrong, he might get to go back to the time that was happiest for him and live there forever? Could that be what heaven is like?
M	PAUL	I just about believe that very thing.
M	BITTERBUCK	Had me a young wife when I was eighteen. Spent our first summer in the mountains. Made love every night. She'd just lie there after, bare-breasted in the firelight, and we'd talk sometimes till the sun come up. That was my best time.
M	PAUL	It'll be fine. You'll do fine.
M	BRUTAL	Roll on two.
M	BRUTAL	Again.
M	PERCY	Adios, Chief. Drop us a card from hell, let us know if it's hot enough.
M	BRUTAL	He's paid what he's owed. He's square with the house again, so keep your goddamn hands off him.
M	PERCY	What's up his ass?
M	PAUL	You, Percy. Always you.
M	PERCY	You gotta hate the new boy? That the way it is around here?
M	PAUL	Why not just move on? Go to Briar Ridge. Yeah, I know about it. Sounds like a good job.
M	PERCY	I might take it, too. Soon as you put me out front.
M	PERCY	You heard me. I want Brutal's spot for the next execution.
M	PAUL	What's with you? Seeing a man die isn't enough? You gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook?
M	PERCY	I wanna be out front, is all. Just one time. Then you'll be rid of me.
M	PAUL	If I say no?
M	PERCY	I might just stick around for good, make me a career of this.
M	COFFEY	Del?
M	PAUL	Delacroix? That you?
M	PAUL	You are not gonna believe this.
F	DEL	Look! I done tame me dat mouse!
M	PAUL	We see that.
F	DEL	Watch dis! Watch what he do!
F	DEL	Ain't he sumpthin now? Ain't Mr. Jingles smart?
M	PAUL	Mr. Jingles?
F	DEL	Dat his name. He whisper it in my ear. Cap'n, can I have a box for my mouse so he can sleep in here wi' me?
M	PAUL	I notice your English gets better when you want something.
F	DEL	Wanna see what else he can do? Watch, watch, watch...
F	DEL	We play fetch, Mr. Jingles? We play fetch?
F	DEL	He fetch it ever' time. Smart as hell, ain't he? We do da trick again, watch, watch, watch...
M	BRUTAL	Who's training who here?
M	COFFEY	That's some smart mouse, Del. Like he's a circus mouse or something.
F	DEL	A circus mouse! Dat jus' what he is, too! A circus mouse! I get outta here, he make me rich, see if he don't!
M	PERCY	Well, well. Looks like you found yourself a new friend, Eddie.
F	DEL	Don' hurt him, 'kay? 'kay?
M	PERCY	That the one I chased?
M	PAUL	Yes, that's the one. Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.
M	PERCY	Is that so?
M	PAUL	Del was just asking for a box. He thinks the mouse will sleep in it, I guess. That he might keep it for a pet. What do you think?
M	PERCY	I think it'll shit up his nose some night and run away, but I guess that's Del's lookout. We oughtta find a cigar box. Get some cotton batting from he dispensary to line it with. That should do real nice.
M	PAUL	Man said get a cigar box.
M	PAUL	Hal? You wanted to see me?
M	HAL	Yeah. Paul. Close the door.
M	HAL	Uh. So you know. You got a new prisoner coming in tomorrow. William Wharton. Young kid. Wild as hell, judging from this...
M	HAL	...been rambling all over the state last few years, causing all kinds of trouble. Finally hit big time. Killed three people in a holdup, including a pregnant woman. Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed on his left arm...bad news all around...
M	PAUL	Hal?
M	HAL	It's a tumor, Paul. A brain tumor.
M	HAL	They got X-ray pictures of it. It's the size of a lemon, they said, and way down deep inside where they can't operate. They say she'll be dead by Christmas. I haven't told her. I can't think how. For the life of me, Paul, I can't think how to tell my wife she's going to die.
M	PAUL	...oh God...oh God...
M	PAUL	I'm going.
F	JAN	What?
M	PAUL	To the doctor. I'm going. Today. Just as soon as we get the new inmate squares away.
F	JAN	That bad?
M	PAUL	Oh yeah.
M	HARRY	Boy's doped to the gills. Dean, hand me them clothes...
M	HARRY	William Wharton! Hey! I'm talking to you! Put these clothes on!
M	PERCY	Hellraiser, huh? Looks more like a limp noodle to me. Hey! Hey, you!
M	PERCY	You been declared competent! Know what that means? Mean's you're gonna ride the lightning, son!
M	PERCY	Bzzzzzzzzt-zap! Just like that! How's it feel to know you're gonna die with your knees bent?
M	DEAN	C'mon, Percy, give us a hand.
F	DEL	Don' look so good, boss. Look like you runnin' you a fever.
M	COFFEY (O.S.)	Boss Edgecomb? Needs ta see you down here, boss.
M	PAUL	Got things to tend to just now, John Coffey. You be still in your cell now, y'hear? Bitterbuck's...
M	COFFEY	Careful.
M	COFFEY	Careful. Careful.
M	BILLY	Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!
M	BILLY	WHOOOEE, BOYS! AIN'T THIS A PARTY, NOW? IS IT, OR WHAT?
M	PAUL	LET HIM GO!
M	BILLY	G'WAN, SHOOT! SEE WHO YA HIT!
M	PAUL	HIT HIM, PERCY! GODDAMN IT, HIT HIM!
M	BILLY	C'MON, PERCY, HIT ME! HIT ME, YOU LIMP NOODLE, HIT ME! YEEHAWWW!
M	BILLY	Big fucker. Snuck up on me. No fair.
M	BRUTAL	Breathe...breathe...that's it...
M	HARRY	We thought he was doped. Didn't we? Didn't we all of us think he was doped?
M	PAUL	You didn't ask? I guess that's not a mistake you'll be need to make again anytime soon, is it?
M	PAUL	Grab his arms! You too, Percy! Percy, goddamn it, get your feet out of cement and help us out here!
M	PAUL	Get Dean looked at right away, make sure he's all right. warden for me. Start off by saying the situation is under control-- it's not a story, he won't appreciate you drawing out the suspense.
M	BRUTAL	What about you? You look about ready to collapse.
M	PAUL	I've got the Mile till you all get back. Go on now. Boss? Needs ta see ya down here.
M	PAUL	This is not a good time, John Coffey. Not a good time at all.
M	COFFEY (O.S.)	But I needs ta see ya, boss. I needs ta talk t'ya.
M	COFFEY	Closer.
M	PAUL	I'm alone here right now, John. Figure this is close enough.
M	COFFEY	Boss, please. I got to whisper in your ear.
F	DEL	Boss? You know you not s'pose to do dat.
M	PAUL	Mind your business, Del. What do you want, John Coffey?
M	COFFEY	Just to help.
M	PAUL	What are you...doing?
F	DEL	HELP! JOHN COFFEY'S KILLING BOSS EDGECOMB! HELP!
M	PAUL	Del, Chrissake, settle down, I'm fine...
M	PAUL	John? John, what's wrong?
M	PAUL	What did you do, big boy? What did you do to me?
M	COFFEY	I helped it. Didn't I help it?
M	PAUL	Yes, but...how?
M	COFFEY	Just took it back, is all. Awful tired now, boss. Dog tired.
F	DEL	What dat man do to you? He throw some gris-gris on you? You look diff'int! Even walk diff'int. Like y'all better!
M	PAUL	You're imagining thing. Lie down, Del. Get you some rest.
F	JAN	Hi, honey. How are you feeling?
M	PAUL	Um...not too bad.
F	JAN	What did the doctor say?
M	PAUL	Oh, you know doctors. Gobble-de- gook mostly.
F	JAN	Paul? What are you doing?
M	PAUL	What's it feel like?
F	JAN	I know what it feels like...it feels great...but...Paul...
F	JAN	Those must've been some pills.
F	JAN	Paul? Not that I'm complaining. But we haven't gone four times in one night since we were nineteen. You wanna tell me just what the hell's going on?
M	PAUL	Well...thing is...I never actually got to the doctor yesterday...
M	PAUL	Brutal? Listen...I'm thinking of taking the morning off sick. You cover the fort for me? That's swell. Thanks. Yeah, I'm sure I'll feel better. Okay.
F	JAN	You sure you ought to do this?
M	PAUL	I'm not sure what I'm sure of.
F	CYNTHIA	I offer you a cold drink?
M	PAUL	Yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be fine. Thank you.
M	PAUL	Mr. Hammersmith. Your office said I'd find you at home today. I hope I'm not troubling you.
M	BURT	That depends, Mr.--?
M	PAUL	Paul Edgecomb. I'm the E Block superintendant at Cold Mountain.
M	BURT	The Green Mile. I've heard of it. Lost a few clients your way.
M	PAUL	That's why I'm here. I'd like to ask you about one of them.
M	BURT	Which client? Now you got my curiosity aroused.
M	PAUL	John Coffey.
M	BURT	Ah, Coffey. He causing you problems?
M	PAUL	No, can't say he is. He doesn't like the dark. He cries on occasion. Other than that...
M	BURT	Cries, does he? Well, he's got a lot to cry about, I'd say. You know what he did.
M	PAUL	I read the court transcripts.
M	PAUL	Thank you, Missus.
F	CYNTHIA	My pleasure. Kids! Lunch is about ready! Y'all come on up!
M	BURT	What exactly are you trying to find out? Satisfy my curiosity, I'll see if I can satisfy yours.
M	PAUL	I've wondered if he ever did anything like that before.
M	BURT	Why? Has he said anything?
M	PAUL	No. But a man who does a thing like that has often developed a taste for it over time. Occurred to me it might be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out. A man his size, and colored to boot, can't be that hard to trace.
M	BURT	You'd think so, but you'd be wrong. Believe me, we tried. It's like he dropped out of the sky.
M	PAUL	How do you explain that?
M	BURT	We're in a Depression. A third of the country's out of work.
M	People are drifting by the	thousands, looking for work, looking for that greener grass. Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't get noticed everywhere he goes... not until he kills a couple of little girls.
M	PAUL	He's...strange, I admit. But there doesn't seem to be any real violence in him. I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith. I deal with 'em day in and day out.
M	BURT	You didn't come up here to ask me whether he might have killed before. You came up here to see if I think he did it at all. That's it, isn't it?
M	PAUL	Do you?
M	BURT	One seldom sees a less ambiguous case. He was found with the victims in his arms. Blurted out a confession right then and there.
M	PAUL	Yet you defended him.
M	BURT	Everyone is entitled to a defense.
F	CYNTHIA	Kids! Lunch!
M	BURT	Y'all listen to your Momma, now!
M	BURT	Tell you something. You listen close, too, because it might be something you need to know.
M	PAUL	I'm listening.
M	BURT	We had us a dog. No particular breed, but gentle. Ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick. Just a sweet mongrel, you know the kind. In many way, a good mongrel dog is like you negro. You get to know it, and often you get to love it. It is of no particular use, but you keep it around because you think it loves you. If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never have to find out any different. My wife and I were not so lucky. Caleb. Come here for a second.
M	BURT	Please, son.
M	BURT	He has the one eye. I suppose he's lucky not to be blind. We get down on our knees and thank God for that much at least. Right Caleb? Okay, go on in now.
M	BURT	That dog attacked my boy for no reason. Just got it into his mind one day. Same with John Coffey. He was sorry afterwards, of that I have no doubt...but those little girls stayed raped and murdered nonetheless. Maybe he's never done it before--my dog never bit before, but I didn't concern myself with that. I went out there with my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out.
M	PAUL	I'm sorry for your trouble.
M	BURT	I'm as enlightened as the next man, Mr. Edgecomb. I would not bring back slavery for all the tea in China. I believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem. But we have to remember that the negro will bite if he gets the chance, just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its mind to do so. Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is. Don't you doubt it, and don't you turn your back on him. You might get away with it once or even a hundred times...but in the end...
M	BURT	You understand?
M	BURT	I'm gonna have to tear that old doghouse down one of these days.
M	PAUL	No, it's not for you.
F	DEL	Oh. Oh my.
M	COFFEY	I'm smelling me some cornbread.
M	PAUL	It's from my missus. She wanted to thank you.
M	COFFEY	Thank me for what?
M	PAUL	You know. For helping me.
M	COFFEY	Helping you with what?
M	COFFEY	Ohhh. Was your missus pleased?
M	PAUL	Several times.
M	COFFEY	This all for me?
F	DEL	Oh my. John, I can smell it from here. I surely can.
M	COFFEY	Can I give some to Del?
M	PAUL	It's yours, John. You do with it as you please.
M	COFFEY	Here's for Del and Mr. Jingles then.
M	BILLY	Hey! What about me? I'm'a get some too, ain't I
M	PAUL	It's yours, John. As you please.
M	COFFEY	Well. Fine. I think I'll keep the rest, then.
M	PAUL	Courtesy of the gentleman across the way.
F	DEL	Oh, John. So very fine of you. So very kind. Mr. Jingles t'ank you.
M	COFFEY	...wel'cm...
M	BILLY	Hey! What about me? Don't you hold out on me, ya big dummy nigger!
M	PAUL	You'll keep a civil tongue on my block.
M	PAUL	You get that one for free. But that's the last one.
M	BILLY	That's it? Just that little bitty one? Guess I'll have to pay out for the rest, huh?
M	BILLY	Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren't it? Oh, the look on your face!
M	HARRY	You believe this? Son of a bitch pissed on me!
M	BILLY	Hey, d'jall like that? I'm currently cooking some turds t'go with it! Nice soft ones! I'll have 'em out t'yall tomorrow!
M	PAUL	We've been looking to clear that room out anyway.
M	BILLY	Hey! Whassit now, movin' day? Y'all wanna come in and dust a little? Y'can shine my knob for me while yer at it!
M	BILLY	You can come in here on your legs, but you'll go out on your backs, Billy the Kid guarantee ya that. C'mon, fuckstick. No sneakin' up on me this time. We'll go man to man, see who's the better fel--
M	PAUL	C'mon, Wild Bill. Little walky walky.
M	BILLY	Don't you call me that! Wild Bill Hickock wasn't no range rider! He was just a bushwackin' John Law! Dumb sonovabitch sat with his back to the door and kilt by a drunk!
M	BRUTAL	Oh, my suds and body! A history lesson! You just never know what you're gonna get when you come to work everyday on the Green Mile. Thank you, Wild Bill.
M	BILLY	Oh, not in there! C'mon now, I'll be good! Honest Injun I will! No! No! Ummmmhhhh...urg...ah!
M	HARRY	Holy Christ, he's pitchin' a fit!
M	PAUL	He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this one.
M	BILLY	ALL I WANTED ME WAS A LITTLE CORNBREAD, YOU MUTHERFUCKERS!
M	BILLY	I learnt my lesson. I'll be good.
M	BILLY	Pssss. Hey. Give'ya nickel for that Moon Pie.
M	BILLY	Li'l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss, yassuh, howdoo you do?
M	BRUTAL	Hope your bags are packed.
M	PAUL	The Moon Pie thing was pretty original. Gotta give him that.
M	PAUL	Del, grab your things. Big day for you and Mr. Jingles.
F	DEL	Whatchoo talkin' bout?
M	PAUL	Important folks heard about your mouse, wanna see him perform. Not just guards, either. One of them's a politician all the way from the state capital, I believe.
F	DEL	You fellas comin'?
M	HARRY	We got other fish to fry just now, Del, but you knock 'em for a loop.
M	COFFEY	You knock 'em for a loop like Mr. Harry says, Del.
M	PAUL	Let's move along briskly, folks. There's not much time.
M	TOOT	I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin' down.
M	EARL	Been sweepin' floors here ten years, never had to wear no damn tie before.
M	BILL	You're a V.I.P. today, Earl, so just shut up.
F	DEL	Messieurs et mesdames! Bienvenue au cirque de mousie!
M	PERCY	Roll on two.
M	VAN HAY	That's that.
M	PAUL	Very good. Very professional.
M	PAUL	Well?
F	DEL	They love Mr. Jingles! They laugh and cheer and clap they hands!
M	PERCY	Well, that's just aces. Pop back in your cell, old-timer.
M	BRUTAL	Percy, you shit.
M	PERCY	Del! Hey, you numb wit, I didn't mean nothin' by it! You all ri--
M	BILLY	Ain't you sweet. Soft. Like a girl. I druther fuck your asshole than your sister's pussy, I think.
M	PAUL	Wharton!
M	BILLY	I let 'im go, I'us just playin' and I let 'im go! Never hurt a hair on his purty head! Your noodle ain't limp at all, loverboy! I think you sweet on ol' Billy the Kid... ...oooh, but smell you.
F	DEL	Lookit, he done piss his pants! Look what the big man done! He bus' other people wid 'is stick, mais oui some mauvais homme, but someone touch him, he make water in his pants jus' like a baby!
M	BRUTAL	Shut up, Del.
M	PERCY	You talk about this to anyone, I'll get you all fired. I swear that to God.
M	PAUL	What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile. Always has.
M	PERCY	You keep laughing, you French- fried faggot. You just keep laughing.
M	PAUL	What about Dean? He's got a little boy would love a pet mouse, I bet.
F	DEL	How could a boy be trust wid Mr. Jingles? Maybe forget to feed him. And how he keep up wid his trainin', just a boy, n'est-ce pas?
M	PAUL	All right, I'll take him.
F	DEL	T'ank you kindly, merci beaucoup, but you live out in the woods, and Mr. Jingles, he be scared to live out dans la foret.
M	PAUL	He whisper that in your ear?
M	BRUTAL	How about Mouseville?
F	DEL	Mouseville?
M	BRUTAL	Tourist attraction down in Florida. Tallahassee, I think. Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
M	PAUL	Yeah, that's right. Tallahassee. Just down the road apiece from the dog university.
M	BRUTAL	You think they'd take Mr. Jingles? You think he's got the stuff?
M	PAUL	Might. He's pretty smart.
F	DEL	Hey! What dis Mouseville?
M	BRUTAL	Tourist attraction, I said. They got this big tent you go into--
F	DEL	Like a cirque? You have to pay?
M	BRUTAL	You shittin' me? Course you pay. Dime a piece, two cents for the kids. And inside the tent there's this mouse city made out of boxes and toilet paper rolls...
M	BRUTAL	...plus they got the Mouseville All-Star Circus. There's mice that swing on trapeze, mice that roll barrels, mice that stack coins...
F	DEL	Dat's it! Dat's da place for Mr. Jingles! You gonna be a circus mouse after all! Gonna live in a mouse city down in Florida!
M	BRUTAL	Percy, no!
M	PERCY	Knew I'd get him sooner or later. Just a matter of time, really.
M	COFFEY	Give'm to me.
M	COFFEY	Give'm to me. Might still be time.
M	BRUTAL	What are you doing?
M	BRUTAL	Paul, what the hell--
F	DEL	Please, John. Oh Johnny, help him, please help him, s'il vous plait.
M	BRUTAL	Oh, dear Jesus. The tail. Look at the tail.
M	DEAN	What did you do?
M	COFFEY	I helped Del's mouse. He a circus mouse. Goan live in a mouse city down in...down in...
M	BRUTAL	Florida?
M	COFFEY	Boss Percy's bad. He mean. He step on Del's mouse. I took it back, though.
M	PAUL	Brute, come along with me. You fellas go on back to you cribbage game.
M	PERCY	Don't start in on me. It was just a mouse. Never belonged here in the first place.
M	PAUL	The mouse is fine. Just fine. You're no better at mouse-killing than anything else around here.
M	PERCY	You expect me to believe that? I heard the goddamn thing crunch.
M	PAUL	Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay? After all our talks about how we should keep the prisoners calm? Aren't you relieved?
M	PERCY	What kind of game is this?
M	PAUL	No game. See for yourself.
M	PERCY	You switched them! You switched them somehow, you bastards!
M	BRUTAL	I always keep a spare mouse in my wallet for occasions such as this.
M	PERCY	You're playing with me, the both of you! Just who the hell do you think you are--
M	PAUL	We're the people you work with, Percy, but not for long. I want your word.
M	PERCY	My word?
M	PAUL	I put you out front for Del, you put in your transfer to Briar Ridge the very next day.
M	PERCY	What if I just call up certain people and tell them you're harassing me? Bullying me?
M	PAUL	Go ahead. I promise you'll leave your share of blood on the floor.
M	PERCY	Over a mouse? You think anyone's gonna give two shits?
M	PAUL	No. But four men will swear you stood by while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean to death. About that people will care, Percy. Even your uncle the governor will care.
M	BRUTAL	Thing like that goes in your work record. Work record can follow a man around a long, long time.
M	PAUL	I put you out front, you put in your transfer. That's the deal.
M	PAUL	You make a promise to a man, you shake his hand.
F	DEL	Hey, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles.
M	PAUL	Eduard Delacroix, will you step forward?
F	DEL	Boss Edgecomb?
M	PAUL	Yes, Del?
F	DEL	Don' let nothin' happen to Mr. Jingles, okay?
F	DEL	Here, take him.
M	PAUL	Del. I can't have a mouse on my shoulder while...you know.
M	COFFEY	I'll take him, boss. Jus' for now. If Del don' mind.
F	DEL	Yeah, you take 'im, John. Take him til' dis foolishment done--bien! After, you take him down to Florida? To dat Mouseville?
M	BRUTAL	We'll do it together, most likely. Maybe take a little vacation time.
F	DEL	People pay a dime apiece to see him. Two cents for the kiddies. Ain't dat right, Boss Howell?
M	BRUTAL	That's right, Del.
F	DEL	You a good man, Boss Howell. You too, Boss Edgecomb. Wish I could'a met you bot' someplace else.
F	DEL	Au revoir, mon ami. Je t'aime, mon petit.
M	FAT LADY	Hope he's good and scared. Hope he knows the fires are stoked, and that Satan's imps are waiting.
M	PERCY	Roll on one.
M	COFFEY	You be still, Mr. Jingles. You be so quiet and so still.
M	PERCY	Eduard Delacroix, you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state. You have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
F	DEL	I sorry for what I do. I give anything to take it back, but I can't. God have mercy on me. Don' forget 'bout Mouseville.
M	PERCY	No such place. That's just a fairy tale these guys told you to keep you quiet. Just thought you should know, faggot.
M	PERCY	Electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead, in accordance with state law. God have mercy on your soul.
M	PERCY	Roll on two.
M	PAUL	It's dry!
M	PAUL	JACK!
M	BRUTAL	Don't you tell him to stop. Don't you do it. It's too late for that.
M	BILLY	HE'S COOKIN' NOW! THEY COOKIN' HIM GOOD! NEAR ABOUT DONE, I RECKON!
M	WITNESSES	What the hell's happening to him?...Are those clamps going to hold?...Christ, the smell!...Is this normal?
M	VAN HAY	SHOULD I KILL THE JUICE?
M	PAUL	NO! ROLL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ROLL!
M	PAUL	No water! No water! You crazy?
M	FAT LADY	Stop it, stop it, oh can't you see he's had enough?
M	HAL	Why don't you shut it down?
M	PAUL	He's still alive! You want me to shut down while he's still alive?
M	PAUL	You watch, you son of a bitch!
M	PAUL	Kill it!
M	BRUTAL	You do it. You're running the show, ain't you?
M	HAL	It's all right, folks, it's all under control. Just a power surge from the storm, that's all, nothing to worry about...
M	PAUL	Dean, get doc's stethoscope.
M	MAN	Oh my God! Is it always like this? Why didn't somebody tell me? I never would have come!
M	PERCY	I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet--
M	PAUL	Brutal, no!
M	BRUTAL	What do you mean, no? How can you say no? You saw what he did!
M	PAUL	Delacroix's dead, nothing can change that, and Percy's not worth it!
M	BRUTAL	So he just gets away with it? Is that how it works?
M	HAL	What the fuck was that? Jesus Christ, three witnesses puked all over the floor up there! And the smell! I got Van Hay to open both doors, but that smell won't come out for five damn years, that's what I'm betting! And that asshole Wharton is singing about it! I can hear him!
M	PAUL	Can he carry a tune, Hal?
M	HAL	Okay, boys. Okay. Now what the hell happened?
M	HAL	Percy? Something to say?
M	PERCY	I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet.
M	HAL	How many years you spend pissing on the toilet seat before somebody told you to put it up?
M	PAUL	Percy fucked up, Hal. Pure and simple.
M	HAL	Is that your official position?
M	PAUL	Don't you think it should be?
M	PAUL	He'll be putting in a transfer request to Briar Ridge tomorrow. Moving on to bigger and better things. Isn't that right, Percy?
M	HAL	You're a little asshole, and I don't like you a bit. Have that transfer request on my desk first thing.
M	BILLY	Barbecue! Me and you! Stinky, pinky, phew-phew-phew! Weren't Billy or Jilly or Hilly or Roy--it was a French-fried faggot named Delacroix!
M	PAUL	You're about ten seconds away from spending the rest of your life in the padded room.
M	COFFEY	Poor Del. Poor old Del.
M	PAUL	Yes. Poor old Del. John, are you okay?
M	COFFEY	I could feel it from here.
M	PAUL	What do you mean? You could hear it? Is that what you mean?
M	COFFEY	He's out of it now, though. He's the lucky one. No matter how it happened, Del's the lucky one.
M	PAUL	Where's Mr. Jingles?
M	COFFEY	Ran down there. Don't think he'll be back. Awful tired now, boss. Dog tired.
M	PAUL	Me too, John. Me too.
M	PAUL	I hate this.
F	JAN	I know.
M	HAL	She's having one of her good days. I thank God for that.
M	PAUL	What a bad day?
M	HAL	Sometimes she's...not herself anymore. She swears.
M	PAUL	Swears.
M	HAL	It just pops out, the most awful language you can imagine. She doesn't even know she's doing it. I didn't know she'd ever heard words like that...and to hear her say them in her sweet voice... I'm glad she's having a good day, Paul. I'm glad for you and Jan.
F	JAN	Honey? If you don't say what's on your mind, I'm afraid I'll have to smother you with a pillow.
M	PAUL	I'm thinking I love you. I'm thinking I don't know what I'd do if you were gone.
F	JAN	Oh.
M	PAUL	I'm also thinking I'd like to have the boys over tomorrow.
M	THE MEN	Ma'am, you sure know how to fry up some fine chicken...Brutal, don't hog the taters now...Try that corn yet? It's something special...
M	PAUL	You saw what he did with the mouse.
M	BRUTAL	I could'a gone the rest of the day without you bringing that up.
M	DEAN	I could'a gone the rest of the year.
M	PAUL	He did it to me too. He put his hands on me and took my bladder infection away.
F	JAN	When he came home, he was...all better.
M	DEAN	You're talking about an authentic healing. A praise-Jesus miracle.
M	PAUL	I am.
M	BRUTAL	If you say it, I accept it. But what's it got to do with us?
F	JAN	Melinda? Oh, Paul...
M	BRUTAL	Melinda? Melinda Moores?
F	JAN	You really think you can help her?
M	PAUL	It's not a bladder infection, or even a busted-up mouse. But there might be a chance.
M	HARRY	Hold on now. You're talking about our jobs. Sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock?
M	PAUL	Hal would never allow that. You know him, he wouldn't believe something unless it fell on him.
M	BRUTAL	So you're talking about taking John Coffey to her. That's more than just our jobs, Paul. Damn right. That's prison time if we get caught.
M	HARRY	Let's not discuss this like it's even an option. Brutal, help me out here...
M	BRUTAL	I'm sure she's a fine woman...
F	JAN	The finest.
M	PAUL	What's happening to her is an offense, Brutal. To the eyes and the ears and the heart.
M	BRUTAL	I have no doubt. But we don't know her like you and Jan do...do we?
M	PAUL	That's why it's a lot to ask.
M	HARRY	It is. Let's not forget Coffey's a murderer. What if he escapes? I'd hate losing my job or going to prison, but I'd hate having a dead child on my conscience even more.
M	PAUL	I don't think that'll happen... ...in fact, I don't think he did it at all.
M	PAUL	I just can't see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child.
M	DEAN	Well, that's a tender notion, but the man's on death row for the crime. Plus, he's huge. If he tried to get away, it'd take a lot of bullets to stop him.
M	BRUTAL	We'd all have shotguns in addition to sidearms. I'd insist on that. He tried anything, we'd have to take him down. You understand.
M	PAUL	I understand.
M	BRUTAL	So. Tell us what you had in mind.
M	BRUTAL	I was never here.
M	ORDERLY	Shit, for five bucks, you was never nowhere.
M	BRUTAL	Fellas thirsty? Fresh out of the icebox.
M	DEAN	Oh, thanks. That's swell.
M	HARRY	Yeah, hot in here.
M	BILLY	Hey. Hey, I'm'a get some too.
M	BRUTAL	My ass you get some too.
M	PAUL	You think you deserve any?
M	HARRY	Day report says he's been okay.
M	BILLY	Hell, yes, I been behaved. C'mon, now, don't be stingy hogs.
M	PAUL	You gonna stay behaved?
M	BILLY	C'mon, you clunk, gimme that.
M	PAUL	You promise me, or I'll drink it myself right here in front of you.
M	BILLY	C'mon now, don't be that way. I be good.
M	PAUL	Cup.
M	BILLY	We'll break out the fire hose and take it anyway. And you will have drunk your last R.C. cola. Unless they serve 'em down in hell.
M	PAUL	Anybody wants to back out, now's the time. After this, there's no turning back. So? We gonna do this?
M	COFFEY	Sure. I'd like to take a ride.
M	BRUTAL	Guess were all in.
M	PERCY	What is this?
M	PAUL	Payback.
M	PERCY	Let go of me! Let go!
M	PAUL	Settle down, Percy!
M	BRUTAL	Oooo, Poicy! What would your mother say?
M	PERCY	Let go, you ignoramus! I know people! Big people!
M	PAUL	So you've said. C'mon, stick out your arms like a good boy.
M	PERCY	I won't. And you can't make me.
M	BRUTAL	You're dead wrong about that, you know.
M	BRUTAL	You gonna put your arms up? I'll rip your ears off. Use 'em for tea caddies. You know I will.
M	PAUL	The man's ripping your ears off, Percy. I'd do as he says.
M	PERCY	Please, Paul. Don't put me in with Wild Bill. Please.
M	PAUL	You would think that.
M	BRUTAL	You'll get 'em back, don't worry.
M	PERCY	That's more than I can say about your jobs. All your jobs! You can't do this to me! You can't!
M	PAUL	Let you in on a little secret. We can and we are.
M	PAUL	You're going to have a few hours of quiet time now, so you can reflect on what you did to Del.
M	BRUTAL	If you get lonely, think about Olive Oyl... ...uk-uk-uk-uk!
M	PAUL	One more time--what do you say if somebody comes by?
M	DEAN	Coffey got upset, so we put him in the restraint room. They hear any noise, they'll think it's him.
M	COFFEY	We goan for the ride now?
M	PAUL	That's right.
M	PAUL	What about us?
M	DEAN	You're over in Admin, going over Del's file. Brutal and Harry are in the laundry doing their wash--
M	BILLY	Where you fink you're goin'?
M	COFFEY	You're a bad man.
M	BILLY	S'right, nigger. Bad as you'd want.
M	BILLY	Whooeee. Whole room's spinning. Like I'm shit-ass drunk. I have me some shine or what?
M	BILLY	Niggers oughtta have they own 'lectric chair. White man oughtn't havta sit in no nigger 'lectric chair, nossir...
M	COFFEY	He's a bad man.
M	COFFEY	They're still in there. Pieces of them, still in there. I hear them screaming.
M	PAUL	John, come along! Right now, y'hear? C'mon! Toward that door!
M	PAUL	Lie down on this. It'll be easier for you and no harder for us.
M	COFFEY	Say. This is fun.
M	COFFEY	Look, boss! It's Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair!
M	PAUL	Shhh. John, you have to be quiet now.
M	COFFEY	You see her? You see the lady?
M	BRUTAL	We see her, John.
M	PAUL	C'mon, big boy, keep moving.
M	BRUTAL	How far is it?
M	HARRY	Just up ahead...
M	COFFEY	Hey there, little firefly. Where's Mrs. Firefly this evening?
M	COFFEY	Oh, there you is. You come out to play too?
M	PAUL	They seem...drawn to you.
M	COFFEY	I love 'em, is why. They don't think no hurtful thoughts. They's just happy to be. Happy little lightning bugs...
M	PAUL	C'mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy.
M	PAUL	John? Do you know where we're taking you?
M	COFFEY	Help a lady?
M	PAUL	That's right. Help a lady. But how did you know?
M	COFFEY	Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I don't know much'a anything. Never have.
M	COFFEY	Bye, fireflies. Bye.
M	BRUTAL	We can still turn back.
M	COFFEY	Boss, look. Someone's up.
M	BRUTAL	This is a mistake. Christ, Paul, what were we thinking?
M	PAUL	Too late now. Harry, keep John here until we call you.
M	HAL	Who the hell goes there at two- thirty in the goddamn morning?
M	PAUL	Hal, it's us! It's Paul and Brutal--it's us!
M	HAL	Paul, what are you doing here at this hour? Jesus, it's not a lockdown, is it? Or a riot?
M	PAUL	Hal, God's sakes, take your finger off the trigger...
M	HAL	Are you hostages? Who's out there? Who's by that truck?
M	HAL	John Coffey! Halt! Halt right there or I shoot!
M	MELINDA (O.S.)	Hal? Who are you talking to, you fucking cocksucker?
M	PAUL	No one's hurt. We're here to help.
M	HAL	Help what? I don't understand. Is this a prison break?
M	PAUL	I can't explain what it is. You just have to trust me.
M	HAL	What do you...want?
F	MELINDA	Hal! Make them go away! No salesmen in the middle of the night! No Fuller brushes! No French knickers with come in the crotch! Tell them to take a flying fuck in a rolling d...d...
M	COFFEY	Just to help. Just to help, boss, that's all.
M	HAL	You can't. No one can.
M	HAL	Don't you go up there! Don't you do it!
M	COFFEY	Boss, you just be quiet now and let me be.
M	MELINDA (O.S.)	Stay out of here! Whoever you are, just stay out! I'm not dressed for visitors, you rat's asshole!
F	MELINDA	Oh, so big! Pull down your pants! Let's have a look!
F	MELINDA	Don't come near me, pigfucker.
F	MELINDA	Why do you have so many scars? Who hurt you so badly?
M	COFFEY	Don't hardly remember, ma'am.
F	MELINDA	What's your name?
M	COFFEY	John Coffey, ma'am. Like the drink, only not spelt the same.
M	COFFEY	Ma'am?
F	MELINDA	Yes, John Coffey?
M	COFFEY	I see it. I see it.
M	COFFEY	You be still now. You be so quiet and so still.
M	BRUTAL	John! Sick it up! Cough 'em out like you done before!
M	BRUTAL	He's choking! Whatever he sucked out of her, he's choking on it!
F	MELINDA	How did I get here? We were going to the hospital in Indianola, weren't we? We stopped and you bought me a packet of posies...
M	HAL	Shhh. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter anymore.
F	MELINDA	Did I have the X-ray? Did I
M	PAUL	Yes.
M	PAUL	It was clear. There was no tumor.
F	MELINDA	Who is that man?
M	PAUL	John? Can you turn around? Can you turn around and see this lady?
F	MELINDA	What's your name?
M	COFFEY	John Coffey, ma'am.
F	MELINDA	Like the drink, only not spelled the same.
M	COFFEY	No, ma'am. Not spelt the same at all.
M	HAL	Melly, no...
F	MELINDA	I dreamed of you. I dreamed you were wandering in the dark, and so was I. We found each other. We found each other in the dark.
F	MELINDA	It's St. Christopher. I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey, and wear it. He'll keep you safe. Please wear it for me.
M	COFFEY	Thank you, ma'am.
F	MELINDA	Thank you, John.
M	PAUL	C'mon, John, stay on your feet.
M	HARRY	Christ, he goes down, we'll need three mules and a crane to pick him up again...
M	BRUTAL	He'll never sit in Old Sparky. You know that, don't you? He swallowed that stuff for a reason. I give him a few days. One of us'll be doing a cell check and there he'll be. Dead on his bunk.
M	PAUL	If that's his choice, he's earned it. Let's get him back on the Mile.
M	DEAN	Am I glad to see you! You were gone so long! Wild Bill's making noises like he's gonna wake up... What the hell's wrong with him?
M	BRUTAL	He's hurting, Dean. Hurting bad.
M	PAUL	John, we're gonna set you on your bunk now. Ready?
M	DEAN	What about Mrs. Moores? Was it like the mouse? Was it a...you know...a miracle?
M	PAUL	Yes. Yes it was.
M	HARRY	Damn. I think we got away with it.
M	BRUTAL	We still gotta convince a certain somebody to keep his trap shut.
M	PAUL	Get his stuff.
M	PAUL	I want to talk, not shout. I take the tape off, you gonna be calm.
M	BRUTAL	My mother always said if you do it fast, it won't hurt so much.
M	BRUTAL	I guess she was wrong.
M	PERCY	Get me out of this nut-coat.
M	PAUL	In a minute.
M	PERCY	Now! Now! Right n--
M	PAUL	You shut up and listen. You deserved to be punished for what you did to Del. You'll accept it like a man, or we'll make you sorry you were ever born. We'll tell people how you sabotaged Del's execution--
M	PERCY	Sabotaged!
M	PAUL	--and how you pissed yourself like a frightened little girl. Yes, we'll talk, that's a given--but, Percy, mind me now...we'll also see you beaten within an inch of your life.
M	PAUL	We know people, too, are you so foolish you don't realize that? People with friends and loved ones doing time in this prison. People who'd be happy to amputate you nose or your penis just so someone they care about could get an extra three hours in the exercise yard every week. Let bygones be bygones. Nothing's hurt so far but your pride...and nobody need ever know about that except the people in this room.
M	BRUTAL	What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile. Always has.
M	PERCY	May I be let out of this coat now?
M	PERCY	My things?
M	PAUL	Think it over, Percy.
M	PERCY	Oh, I intend to. I intend to think about it very hard. Starting right now.
M	BRUTAL	He'll talk. Sooner or later.
M	PAUL	Easy, easy. You all right?
M	BILLY	What'a you looking at, you limp noodle? You wanna kiss my ass or suck my dick?
M	DEAN	Oh God, oh God, no...
M	COFFEY	Punished them bad men.
M	PAUL	Why Wild Bill? Why?
M	COFFEY	I saw in his heart. When he grab my arm, I saw what Wild Billy done. Saw plain as day. Can't hide what's in your heart.
M	PAUL	What? Saw what?
M	COFFEY	Take my hand, boss. You see for yourself.
M	BRUTAL	Paul, no!
M	COFFEY	My hand.
M	PAUL	No...please...
M	COFFEY	Gots to, boss. Gots to give you a little bit of myself. A gift, like. A gift of what's in me so you can see...
M	BILLY	You lover your sister? You make any noise, know what happens? I'll kill her instead of you. And if you make any noise, I'll kill her.
M	COFFEY	He kill 'em with they love. They love for each other. You see how it is?
M	COFFEY	That's how it is ever' day. That's how it is all over the worl'...
M	DEAN	...well, I dunno, he just snapped, I guess...
M	HARRY	...s'right, one minute he's fine, the next--blammo...
M	BRUTAL	...bastard grabbed him through the bars a few days back, scared the boy so bad he wet himself...
M	COP #1	Son! Son! Can you hear me?
M	COP #2	Speak up if you can hear us! We gotta ask you some questions!
M	MEDIC	I think this boy's cheese slid off his cracker.
M	HAL	I'll cover you as much as I can, even if it mean my job, but I have to know. Does this have anything to do with what happened at my house? Does it, Paul?
M	PAUL	No.
M	PAUL	It makes sense. I read the file. Hal even said it himself. Wharton rambled all over the state last few years, causing trouble. Hell, longer than that. Been at it since he was ten. Vandalism. Petty theft. Setting fires.
F	JAN	You saw him. You actually saw this Wild Bill person take those girls.
M	PAUL	Their father hired him on for a few days last spring, help repair the barn. Cheap labor, just another drifter...
M	BRUTAL	Only not.
M	PAUL	Sick bastard came back a month later, just before dawn. Took the girls...did what he did. Coffey found them afterwards and tried to help. It was too late.
F	JAN	Then you can stop it. The execution, I mean. Get Coffey a new trial.
M	PAUL	Based on what, honey? Some kind of magical vision I had?
F	JAN	Show this farmer--what's his name, Detterick?--show him a picture of Wild Bill. Why not? If Wharton was there...if the farmer can identify his picture and they know he was there...
M	BRUTAL	Him being there in May doesn't mean he came back and killed those girls in June. Even if he was committing other crimes.
M	PAUL	They got their killer as far as they're concerned.
M	Hell, Coffey's own lawyer would	come throw the switch if we let him.
F	JAN	Then lie.
M	PAUL	Lie? About what?
F	JAN	Tell them Wharton confessed to the crime. Brutus, you can back him up, say you heard it too. You can say that's what set Percy off. He shot Wharton because he couldn't stand thinking of what happened to those two little girls, it snapped his mind... ...what? What now?
M	DEAN	We never reported anything like that. We would've, too, everybody knows it. It's part of our job. Besides, confessing don't make it so. Slugs like Wild Bill lie about everything. Crimes they committed, women they had, even the weather.
F	JAN	But he was there! He painted their barn! He ate dinner with them!
M	PAUL	All the more reason he might take credit for the crime. He's gonna fry anyway, so why not boast?
F	JAN	All right. Then you've got to get John Coffey out on your own.
M	HARRY	Ma'am?
F	JAN	You did it once, didn't you? Only this time, don't bring him back.
M	DEAN	Ma'am, your son's grown up and moved away. My kids are just starting kindergarten. Will you be the one to explain to them why their daddy's in prison?
F	JAN	Work out a plan. Make it look like a real escape.
M	HARRY	Better be a plan an imbecile could dream up. Nobody'd believe it otherwise.
M	BRUTAL	Even if we did think of something, it wouldn't do any good.
F	JAN	Why not? Just why the hell not?
M	PAUL	Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch baldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself. How long you think it'd be before he was recaptured? Two hours? Six?
F	JAN	Do you mean to kill him, you cowards? Do you?
F	JAN	Don't touch me! Next week this time you'll be a murderer, no better than that man Wharton, so don't touch me!
F	JAN	I'm so sorry I called you a coward. I feel worse about that than anything I've ever said to you in our whole marriage.
M	PAUL	Even that time we went camping and you called me Old Stinky Sam?
F	JAN	Does Hal know? That Coffey's innocent, I mean? Can he help? Does he have the influence to do something about this?
M	PAUL	No.
F	JAN	Then don't tell him. If he can't help, don't tell him. Ever.
M	PAUL	I won't.
F	JAN	There's no way out of this for you, is there?
M	PAUL	No. I've been thinking about it, too, believe me. Tell you the truth, honey. I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of, but this is the first time I've ever felt in real danger of hell.
F	JAN	Hell? Oh Paul... Talk to him. Talk to John. Find out what he wants.
M	COFFEY	Hello, boss.
M	PAUL	Hello, John.
M	PAUL	I guess you know we're coming down to it now. Another couple of days. Is there anything special you'd like for dinner that night? We can rustle you up most anything.
M	COFFEY	Meatloaf be nice. Mashed taters with gravy. Okra, maybe. I's not picky.
M	PAUL	What about a preacher? Someone you could say a little prayer with?
M	COFFEY	Don't want no preacher. You can say a prayer, if you want. I could get kneebound with you, I guess.
M	PAUL	Me?
M	PAUL	S'pose I could, if it came to that.
M	PAUL	John, I have to ask you something very important right now.
M	COFFEY	I know what you gonna say. You don' have to say it.
M	PAUL	I do. I do have to. John, tell me what you want me to do. You want me to take you out of here? Just let you run away? See how far you can get?
M	COFFEY	Why would you do such a foolish thing?
M	PAUL	I stand before God, and He asks me why did I kill one of his true miracles, what am I gonna say? That is was my job? My job?
M	COFFEY	You tell God the Father it was a kindness you done. I know you hurtin' and worryin', I can feel it on you, but you oughtta quit on it now. Because I want it over and done. I do.
M	COFFEY	I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. Tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. and hear in the world ever' day. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. Can you understand?
M	PAUL	Yes, John. I think I can.
M	BRUTAL	There must be something we can do for you, John. There must be something you want.
M	COFFEY	I ain't never seen me a flicker show.
M	FRED ASTAIRE	Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak...
M	COFFEY	Why, they's angels. Angels. Just like up in heaven...
M	COFFEY	I be all right, fellas. This here's the hard part. I be all right in a little while.
M	PAUL	John, I should have that just for now. I'll give it back after.
M	COFFEY	You know, I fell asleep this afternoon and had me a dream. I dreamed about Del's mouse.
M	PAUL	Did you, John?
M	COFFEY	I dreamed he got down to that place Boss Howell talked about, that Mouseville place. I dreamed there was kids, and how they laughed at his tricks! My!
M	COFFEY	I dreamed those two little blonde- headed girls were there. They 'us laughing, too. I put my arms around 'em and sat 'em on my knees, and there 'us no blood comin' outta their hair and they 'us fine. We all watch Mr. Jingles roll that spool, and how we did laugh. Fit to bus', we was.
M	PAUL	What should we pray for, John?
M	COFFEY	Strength?
M	PAUL	God, please help us finish what we've started, and please welcome this man, John Coffey--like the drink, but not spelled the same-- into heaven and give him peace. Please help us to see him off the best we can and let nothing go wrong. Amen.
M	COFFEY	I know a prayer I once heard. Can I say it?
M	PAUL	You go right ahead, John. Take all the time you need.
M	COFFEY	Baby Jesus, meek and mild, pray for me...
M	KATHE AND CORA	...and every child. Be my strength, be my friend...
M	COFFEY	...be with me until the end. Amen.
F	MARJORIE	Die slow, you bastard.
M	COFFEY	They's a lot of folks here hate me. A lot. I can feel it. Like bees stinging me. It hurts.
M	BRUTAL	Feel how we feel, then. We don't hate you--can you feel that?
F	MARJORIE	Kill him twice, you boys! You go on and kill that raping baby- killer twice, that'd be fine!
M	PAUL	Wipe you face before you stand up, Dean.
M	PAUL	Roll on one.
F	MARJORIE	Does it hurt yet? I hope it does! I hope it hurts like hell!
M	PAUL	John Coffey...you have been condemned to die in the electric chair by a jury of your peers...sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state. Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
M	COFFEY	I'm sorry for what I am.
F	MARJORIE	You ought to be! Oh, you monster, you damn well ought to be!
M	COFFEY	Please, boss, don't put that thing over my face. Don't put me in the dark, I's afraid of the dark.
M	PAUL	All right, John.
M	COFFEY	...heaven...I'm in heaven... heaven...heaven...heaven...
M	BRUTAL	Paul. You have to say it. You have to give the order.
M	COFFEY	He kill 'em with they love. That's how it is ever' day. All over the worl'...
M	PAUL	Roll on two.
M	PAUL	That was the last execution I ever took part in. Just couldn't do it anymore after that. Brutal either. We both transferred out, took jobs with Boys' Correctional. That was all right. Catch 'em young, that became my motto. Might even have done some good.
M	PAUL	You don't believe me.
F	ELAINE	I don't imagine you would lie to me, Paul. It's just that...
M	PAUL	...It's quite a story.
F	ELAINE	Yes. Quite a story. One thing I don't understand. You said you and Jan had a grownup son in 1935. Is that right? But if that's true...
M	PAUL	The math doesn't work, does it?
M	PAUL	You feel up to a walk?
M	PAUL	There. It's in there.
F	ELAINE	Paul? This thing you want to show me. Is it scary?
M	PAUL	Scary? No. Not really.
M	PAUL	There.
M	PAUL	Hey. Wake up, old boy. Wake up.
F	ELAINE	Paul? It isn't...it can't be...
M	PAUL	Come over here, boy. Come on over her and see this lady.
F	ELAINE	That can't be Mr. Jingles.
M	PAUL	Messieurs et mesdames. Beinvenue au cirque du mousie.
F	ELAINE	Oh, Paul. Don't make him do it again. I can't bear to watch.
M	PAUL	But he loves it so much.
M	PAUL	This isn't exactly the Mouseville we had in mind...but we make do, don't we, old fella?
M	BRAD (O.S.)	As I live and breathe!
M	BRAD	Fooled you, didn't I Got yourself a little love nest here, I see...
M	BRAD	...what the fuck? Is that a mouse?
M	PAUL	Don't hurt him, okay? Okay?
M	BRAD	It's a goddamn mouse, y'old fool, they carry all kind'a disease...
M	BRAD	...now step aside.
M	PAUL	You leave him alone, Percy! You leave him alone, or by God I'll--
M	BRAD	Who you calling Percy? Name's Brad, you senile fucker. And I'm gonna nail that mouse, you can take that to the everfucking bank.
F	ELAINE	How dare you? Get out!
M	BRAD	Piss off, you wrinkeldy old bitch. Me and Paulie are talking.
F	ELAINE	His name is Mr. Edgecomb. If you ever call him Paulie again, your days of employment at Georgia Pines will end.
M	BRAD	Who the hell you think you are?
F	ELAINE	I am the grandmother of the man who is currently Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives. A man who loves his relatives, Mr. Dolan. All it would take is a phone call.
F	ELAINE	At first I thought I'd let you be. I'm old, and that seemed easiest. But when my friends are threatened and abused, I do not let it be. Now get out, or you won't work another day here. Not another hour. I swear it.
M	BRAD	Don't know what you're getting so het up about. Just a damn mouse.
F	ELAINE	Get out, you ignorant man. What little mind you have is ugly and misdirected.
M	BRAD	Don't bother coming back here tomorrow...Mr. Edgecomb Gonna be a new lock on this door. This is off-limits to residents, no matter what Mrs. My Shit Don't Stink has to say about it.
F	ELAINE	Little trick I learned from Percy Wetmore.
M	PAUL	Is your grandson really Speaker of the House?
F	ELAINE	He is.
M	PAUL	You gonna thank the lady? She just saved your old mousie hide.
M	PAUL	I think Mr. Jingles happened by accident. I think when we electrocuted Del, and it all went so badly...well, John could feel it, you know...and I think a tiny part of whatever was inside of him just leapt out... Me, I was no accident. John had to give me a little part of himself...a gift, like...so I could see for myself what Wild Bill had done. When John did that, a part of whatever power worked through him spilled into me.
F	ELAINE	He...what? Infected you with life?
M	PAUL	That's as good a word as any. He infected us both, didn't he, Mr. Jingles. With life. I'm a hundred and five years old, Elaine. I was forty the year John Coffey walked the Green Mile.
F	ELAINE	...oh my God...
M	PAUL	I haven't even had a cold since 1935. I've had to watch my friends and loved ones die off through the years...Hal and Melinda...Brutus Howell...my wife...my son... ...and you, Elaine. You'd die, too, and my curse is knowing I'll be there to see it...
M	PAUL (V.O.)	...that's my punishment, you see? My punishment for letting John Coffey ride the lightning...for killing a miracle of God...
M	PAUL (V.O.)	...you'll be gone, like all the others, and I'll have to stay...
M	PAUL (V.O.)	I'll die eventually, I imagine. I have no illusions of immortality. But I will have wished for death long before death finds me.
M	PAUL (V.O.)	In truth, I wish for it already.
M	PAUL	Mr. Jingles?
M	PAUL	Where you been, boy? I've been worried about you. You hungry?
M	PAUL (V.O.)	I lie in bed most nights, thinking about it. And I wait...
M	PAUL (V.O.)	I think about all the people I've loved, now long gone. and how I lost her so many years ago. I think about all of us walking our own Green Mile, each in our own time. But one thought, more than any other, keeps me awake most nights... ...if he could make a mouse live so long, how much longer do I have?
M	PAUL (V.O.)	We each owe a death, there are no exceptions, but sometimes, oh God, the Green Mile is so long...
