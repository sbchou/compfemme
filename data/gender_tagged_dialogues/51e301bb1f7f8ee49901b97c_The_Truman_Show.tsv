M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	"One doesn't discover new lands	without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time."
F	TRUMAN	Shit!
M	FATHER	Truman! Truman! Stop!
M	FATHER	Come down now!
M	FATHER	No!
F	TRUMAN	Why? What's there?
M	FATHER	Nothing's there. It's the same as this. Come down, please!
M	FATHER	I told you to stay close. Don't ever leave my sight again. You gotta know your limitations. You could've been washed away by the tide.
F	TRUMAN	Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald".
M	VENDOR	We ran out.
F	TRUMAN	Thanks anyway.
M	DOUGLAS	I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.
M	SISTER	Tell the class what a chiropractor does, Douglas.
M	DOUGLAS	He helps people by fixing their backs, Sister Olivia.
M	SISTER	That's right, Douglas. Perhaps I'll be your first patient.
M	SISTER	What about you, Truman?
F	TRUMAN	I want to be an explorer ...like Magellan.
M	SISTER	No one's going to pay you to do that, Truman. Besides, you're too late. There's nothing left to explore.
F	TRUMAN	...okay, okay, let's call it what it is... I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance is death insurance...you just gotta ask yourself two questions...one, in the event of your death, will anyone experience financial loss?...and two, do you care?
F	TRUMAN	Hold on will ya? This's no good. Lumps all drownings together. I need drownings broken down by category.
F	TRUMAN	...just think about what I've been saying and lemme...hello?...
F	TRUMAN	Can you connect me with directory inquiries in Sydney, Australia? ...er, yes. Do you have a listing for a Lauren Powers... ...nothing listed?...what about a Sylvia Powers...nothing? Thanks...
M	TYRONE	How's it goin', Truman?
F	TRUMAN	Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
M	TYRONE	Good. Good.
F	TRUMAN	Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
M	TYRONE	I'd ask for identification.
M	FEMALE CASHIER	He's right there. You're supposed to pay when he's here.
M	MALE CUSTOMER	He never notices.
M	TYRONE	Hold on, Truman. I got somethin' to show ya.
M	TYRONE	The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese navigator, huh? I know you love this like me.
F	TRUMAN	Not me. You got the wrong man.
M	TYRONE	See ya tomorrow, Truman.
M	CHRISTOF	You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road? They're pulling out a body. You know you shouldn't look, but you do.
M	MAN	Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough insurance.
F	TRUMAN	...this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable - when will death occur? Could be a week, a month, a year. Could happen today...A sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella...No way you can guard against that kinda thing, no way at all...
M	LAWRENCE	Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in Stapleton I need you to cloes by four.
F	TRUMAN	Stapleton on Staten Island?
M	LAWRENCE	You know another one?
F	TRUMAN	I can't do it.
M	LAWRENCE	A half hour across the bay. Sea air. Do you good.
F	TRUMAN	No, I... ...I got an appointment uptown.
M	LAWRENCE	This is a sure thing. They're upping our quota. You need this.
F	TRUMAN	Let's go further, daddy! Let's go further!
M	FATHER	It's getting late, Truman.
F	TRUMAN	Please!...
M	COMMUTER 1	I can't believe he's taking the long way.
M	COMMUTER 2	He'll never make it.
F	TRUMAN	I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.
M	CONCIERGE	You from the insurance company? You missed him.
F	TRUMAN	When will he be back?
M	CONCIERGE	Vacation. Two months. He waited as long as he could. You was supposed to be here by four.
M	YOUTH 1	You wanna read to me?
M	YOUTH 1	You wannna read to me?
M	YOUTH 2	My friend asked you a question.
M	WOMAN	Please...
M	YOUTH 2	Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.
M	YOUTH 1	We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby. Don't you wanna know how it ends?
M	WOMAN	Help!! Please, help!!
M	WOMAN	Thanks.
M	WOMAN	He did nothing.
M	YOUTH 1	Physical violence paralyzes him. Always has.
F	MERYL	I got it free with the tune-up.
F	MERYL	You missed a section.
F	TRUMAN	Do they hurt?
F	MERYL	I was afraid I'd seize up during cross. One of the keys kept sticking.
F	TRUMAN	Is he gonna take the stand?
F	MERYL	No point. Two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs.
F	MERYL	You gonna eat before you leave?
F	TRUMAN	I'll get something out.
F	MERYL	Did something happen today?
F	TRUMAN	What could happen?
F	MARLON	Ouch. Whose nuts were those?
F	TRUMAN	Mine.
F	TRUMAN	I gotta get out, Marlon.
F	MARLON	Yeah? Outta what?
F	TRUMAN	Outta my job, outta Queens...out!
F	MARLON	Outta your job? What the hell's wrong with your job? You gotta great job. You gotta desk job. I'd kill for a desk job.
F	MARLON	Sonofabitch.
F	TRUMAN	It doesn't mean anything.
F	MARLON	Nothing means anything. Try stocking vending machines for a living. My biggest decision of the day is whether the Almond Joys look better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.
F	TRUMAN	I gotta get out.
F	MARLON	Sure and go where?
F	TRUMAN	Australia.
F	MARLON	No shit. Where is Australia exactly? Near England?
F	TRUMAN	See here, this is Queens. All the way round here, Australia. You can't get any further away before you start coming back. Y'know, there're still places in Australia where no human being has ever set foot.
F	MARLON	So when are you leaving?
F	TRUMAN	It's not that simple. Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about that. I just gotta move slow. Pick a moment. Bonus time's just around the corner. Soon as I get a retaining wall built on the back of the house I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone. Up and away on that big steel bird. I'm going, don't you worry about that.
F	MARLON	I never knew anybody who got out.
F	TRUMAN	Tick-fucking-tock. That's the fucking problem, Marlon. I'm thirty-four. I'm older than Jesus Christ.
F	TRUMAN	Where do the dreams go, Marlon?
F	MARLON	You win.
F	TRUMAN	I'm serious. Where do the dreams go?
F	MARLON	They're still there. Just buried under what we settled for.
F	TRUMAN	You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
F	MARLON	Sure. It's halogen. You oughta report it. You coming for a drink?
F	TRUMAN	I can't tonight.
F	TRUMAN	I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
F	MERYL	What are you doing? Come to bed.
F	TRUMAN	I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
F	MERYL	Oh. God, everytime you and Marlon--
F	TRUMAN	--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
F	MERYL	And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
F	TRUMAN	Maybe I feel like a teenager.
F	TRUMAN	Meryl, it'd be an adventure.
F	MERYL	We said we'd try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
F	TRUMAN	That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.
F	MERYL	You want to be an explorer? You mean like all the other great explorers from Queens? You don't even have a passport, Truman. I bet you don't even know how to get one.
F	MERYL	This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
M	GUARD 1	How can they have a child?
M	GUARD 2	It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
M	GUARD 1	Why not?
M	GUARD 2	You think she'd go through with it? Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
F	TRUMAN	Daddy!!...Daddy!!...
M	OLD WOMAN 1	It left him with more than his obvious fear of the water. It's as if he felt his father had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed never to repeat the mistake. He was never the same curious little boy again.
M	OLD WOMAN 2	We're all born with a pound of cocaine up our nose. By the time we're eleven it runs out.
M	OLD WOMAN 1	Half the people I knew named their babies after him.
F	TRUMAN	Daddy...
F	TRUMAN	Hey, stop! Stop!!
M	ATTENDANT	Hey!
F	TRUMAN	Two, four, oh, six.
F	TRUMAN	Outta the way! Outta the way!
M	ATTENDANT	What the fuck are you trying to pull?!
F	TRUMAN	I'm sorry! I'm sorry! No harm done! No harm done!
M	ATTENDANT	I oughta fuck you up!
M	ATTENDANT	Get the fuck outta here.
F	MARLON	What're you doing? The man told you there's no such bus.
F	TRUMAN	He's lying. Two, four, oh, six was definitely the number.
F	TRUMAN	I never believed he was dead.
F	MARLON	C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find a body. You know what the currents are like in that water.
F	TRUMAN	You had to see his face when that wave hit. He wasn't scared Marion. It was like he was expecting it, waiting for it. He knew it was coming.
F	MARLON	Why would he fake it? He's not Elvis Presley.
F	TRUMAN	You know what was really strange about today? An old woman with a little dog and a businessman, walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork. They force him onto a bus against his will, a bus that doesn't normally stop outside my building. And when I'm giving chase, the bus never makes another stop and I get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure I never catch up with it.
F	MARLON	Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and the buses and the cars? What are you saying, the entire population of Lower Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding out that your father staged his death to pursue a life as a street person? Oh yeah, that makes sense.
F	TRUMAN	You think I imagined it, don't you?
F	MARLON	I think you're missing your dad. The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?
F	MARLON	You got sand in your cuffs.
F	TRUMAN	Maybe you're right. If only the old woman hadn't left her dog behind.
M	RAQUEL	Don't you dare go in. Truman. I just got her off to sleep.
F	TRUMAN	It was Dad. I swear.
M	RAQUEL	Well, the next time he shows up. bring him over. Until then, I'm not saying a word about this to Mom and neither are you.
F	TRUMAN	If it wasn't him, it was his twin. Can you think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?
M	RACQUEL	I know a reason he'd want to hide from you. Look at how you treat us. You live ten minutes away, we hardly see you from year to year and then you turn up with this story so insane you don't even believe it yourself. Haven't you hurt her enough, Truman? She already blames you.
F	TRUMAN	I was seven years old!
M	RAQUEL	But you're here and he's not. Has it really taken you this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?
F	TRUMAN	I'm telling you he's alive!
M	RAQUEL	And I'm telling you he's fish food!
M	CHRISTOF	You did well.
F	CHLOE	We've tightened security.
F	CHLOE	Why would he do this to us?
M	CHRISTOF	Old age. Sentiment. You play someone's father all those years, you are someone's father...He sees the way Truman is. He feels responsible.
M	YOUNG CHRISTOF	...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...
M	YOUNG CHRISTOF	The freak wave will strike from the starboard side. Remember, you don't go to the diver. The diver goes to you.
M	YOUNG CHRISTOF	...Good! Good!...of course, on the day you only surface once you're safely beyond the cove...Try it one more time...You okay?
F	MERYL	What're you doing out here?
F	TRUMAN	Fixing the mower.
F	MERYL	Your sister called. She was worried about you.
F	TRUMAN	I saw my father on State Street dressed as a homeless man.
F	MERYL	I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.
F	TRUMAN	What do you want?
F	MERYL	I made macaroni.
F	TRUMAN	I gotta go out. About a replacement... ...mower blade. ...west on Atlantic...he's making a right on Woodhaven...
M	MALE VOICE (from radio)	...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's on the move again, passing the Burger King...
M	MALE VOICE	...something's wrong. Change frequencies...
M	VERONICA	Hey, Truman! Where you bin? You bin cheatin' on me? VERONICA Bout time you got this thing cleaned. Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady wear it.
M	VERONICA	God, do they still make this stuff? What's the Sell-By Date?
F	CHLOE	...you see him messing with the antenna...what did you think would happen?..."lapse of concentration", is that what you call it? I call it amateur-hour... In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to do it over.
F	CHLOE	You think this is funny?
M	CHRISTOF	The mask has slipped before. Everything can be explained.
M	CHRISTOF	What's dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the girl.
M	VERONICA	Like I say, I don't normally do this. I gotta charge extra.
M	CHRISTOF (V.O.)	He's re-created the event on and off for a number of years. We've never understood what prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy to approach her in the first place...
M	CHRISTOF (V.O.)	We'd noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought he'd say anything. She was a year older, wrote poetry, way out of his league...
F	TRUMAN	
M	GIRLFRIEND 1	See you in class.
F	TRUMAN	Lauren, right?
M	LAUREN	No.
F	TRUMAN	Look. I was wonder--
M	LAUREN	--I can't go out with you.
F	TRUMAN	I haven't asked you yet.
M	LAUREN	Well when you do, that's my answer. I'm sorry. It's not up to me.
F	TRUMAN	Why, you married?
F	TRUMAN	I'm not asking you to have my children, just a pizza. How about Saturday?
M	LAUREN	No.
F	TRUMAN	Friday?
M	LAUREN	Now.
F	TRUMAN	Right now? We got finals.
M	LAUREN	If we don't go now, it won't happen.
M	LAUREN	Well, what do you want to do?
M	CHRISTOF (V.O.)	We knew we were taking a risk. She hadn't been properly coached, but we were torn... He'd summoned the courage to make the approach...We wanted to reward that. Of course she took full advantage...
M	LAUREN	I never knew this place existed.
M	LAUREN	Come on! Come on! It's wonderful!
F	TRUMAN	I...I can't.
M	LAUREN	That's right. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
F	TRUMAN	Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about. Has someone been talking to you?
M	LAUREN	Get me out of here. I don't want to be here.
F	TRUMAN	What are you talking about? Lauren! Lauren!
M	LAUREN	My name's not Lauren! It's Sylvia!
M	SYLVIA	In a minute someone's going to come and stop me talking to you.
F	TRUMAN	Who? There's no one around.
M	SYLVIA	You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan. And your teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore." And all the other kids laughed. And you sat down.
F	TRUMAN	How do you know about that?
M	SYLVIA	It doesn't matter. You've forgotten about that boy, Truman. You got scared. Just because something happens, doesn't mean you can't take another chance in your life.
F	TRUMAN	I don't understand.
M	SYLVIA	There isn't much time. Just listen. Everybody's pretending Truman. Everybody but you. Look at that project. You think anybody lives there? It's all for you, Truman. A show. The eyes are everywhere.
F	TRUMAN	Eyes? Where?
M	SYLVIA	Everywhere, disguised...Truman, they're going to fill your head with lies. You've got to make yourself deaf, you understand? When you're afraid the most, it means you're on the right track. Trust that boy. Promise me you'll do that?
M	SYLVIA	I told you, Truman!
F	TRUMAN	Hey!
M	MAN	Get in the car, Lauren!
F	TRUMAN	Who are you?!
M	MAN	I'm her father!
M	SYLVIA	No he's not! He's just saying that! Does he look anything like me?!
F	TRUMAN	Shut your mouth!
F	TRUMAN	Leave her alone!
M	MAN	I told you not to come here anymore! Which one are you?
M	SYLVIA	Don't listen to him, Truman. Make yourself deaf. Come find me.
M	MAN	Don't bother! We're moving to Australia. New York's done something to her head.
M	CHRISTOF (V.O.)	Why did he say Australia? Why couldn't he have said New Jersey?
M	VERONICA	You want me to do it again? I think I could do it better.
F	TRUMAN	No...thank you.
F	TRUMAN	Veronica, what do you know for sure?
M	VERONICA	For sure? The nuns at my school, they used to say, "The whole of life is faith."
M	VERONICA	On the house.
M	CHRISTOF (V.O.)	We removed all physical trace of her but we couldn't erase the memory...
M	CHRISTOF (V.O.)	When he decided to go after Sylvia, we were forced to intervene once again...
F	TRUMAN	I've got something to tell you, Sis.
M	RAQUEL	I've got something to tell you too.
F	TRUMAN	I'm going to Australia.
M	RAQUEL	Mom's real sick.
M	WAITRESS	She was willing to lose him if it meant he could find himself. Never mind.
M	SECURITY GUARD 1	Can I help?
F	TRUMAN	I have an appointment at, er...Diamond Enterprises.
M	SECURITY GUARD 1	They went bust.
M	SECURITY GUARD 1	You gotta leave.
F	TRUMAN	What're they doing?
M	SECURITY GUARD 2	You gotta leave.
F	TRUMAN	Just tell me what the hell's going on?
M	SECURITY GUARD 1	We're re-modelling.
F	TRUMAN	Like fuck! What're they doing?
F	TRUMAN	You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!
M	SECURITY GUARD 2	Investigate what? You're trespassing!
M	OFFICIAL	You can't--
F	TRUMAN	--I know.
F	TRUMAN	You ever been into the AMT Building?
M	LAWRENCE	Not since they begun reconstruction. What're you doing with that?
F	TRUMAN	I'm going to visit a site.
M	LAWRENCE	What for?
F	TRUMAN	Because I never do.
M	LAWRENCE	That's why we got adjusters.
F	TRUMAN	You got a problem with me going?
M	LAWRENCE	I got a problem with you not doing your job, Burbank. You already screwed up once this week.
F	TRUMAN	Let me worry about that.
M	LAWRENCE	680 West 89th.
M	MOVER 1	Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!
F	TRUMAN	Is there another way? Can't you get around this?
F	TRUMAN	When was the fire?
M	BOY	Week ago.
F	TRUMAN	How come it's still smoking?
M	BOY	Started up again. Kids.
F	TRUMAN	Says here it burnt to the ground.
M	BOY	Wishful thinking maybe?
F	TRUMAN	Someone send you to tell me all this?
M	BOY	You the one askin' questions.
M	CHRISTOF	...Everybody stay focused...remember who you are...
M	CHRISTOF	Damn!
F	TRUMAN	Small world.
M	JOGGER 1	Excuse me.
F	TRUMAN	You don't remember? Two days ago I gave you my meatball sandwich in the park. You were in a wheelchair. Same sneakers.
F	TRUMAN	A miracle!
M	JOGGER 2	Get the hell outta here.
F	TRUMAN	Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.
F	MARLON	Truman! Sorry, I'm up against it today.
F	TRUMAN	I've fallen over something, Marlon. Something to do with my Dad. I think.
F	MARLON	Are you okay? You look like shit.
F	TRUMAN	It's big, Marlon. You wouldn't believe who's in on it.
F	MARLON	In on what?
F	TRUMAN	There's no point trying to show you, they cover their tracks too well. But I've been going into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta
F	MARLON	Something's definitely in the air. My last delivery, a kid got crushed to death. tilting a vending machine. They won't even let me take the rest of the day off.
F	TRUMAN	Do it, anyway.
F	TRUMAN	I'm deadly serious. Marlon. We can't talk here. I'm being followed.
F	MARLON	Who?
F	TRUMAN	I don't know. They look just like regular people. But I've been writing down numbers - license plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same
F	MARLON	Is someone leanin' on you, Tru? Cos I got some friends here, they owe me. We can lean back. Is he one of them?
F	TRUMAN	I don't know. Could be. One thing's certain. The key is spontoneity. Be unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get outta here. Can you come with me?
F	MARLON	Christ, Truman. You're gonna get both our asses fired.
F	MARLON	Where're we going?
F	TRUMAN	The beach.
M	CHRISTOF	I can't believe how much he's shoved down. That he sensed the significance at aged seven and clung to it so fiercely.
M	CHRISTOF	You remember, Moses, it used to end right there, before the expansion.
M	ROMAN	Christof, the cracks are starting to show.
M	CHRISTOF	I'll paper over them.
F	CHLOE	Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and recovered.
M	ROMAN	No, not like this. It's compromised. Becoming unwatchable.
M	CHRISTOF	Fear? Doubt? Is that what you have trouble watching? Perhaps you don't like watching yourself.
M	MOSES	Why don't you two wait outside?
M	CHRISTOF	He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all. We'll get him back on.
M	MOSES	You know why they're so nervous. The birth of Truman's child is going to double revenue. For God's sake don't let him upstage you. You've been grooming a successor.
M	CHRISTOF	He's not ready.
M	MOSES	Him or you?
M	CHRISTOF	You can't pull him back in without me. He's just acting out of character.
M	MOSES	What if he's in character? What if he's starting to act in character at last? Have you ever considered that?
F	MARLON	What're we doing here, Truman?
F	TRUMAN	This is where it started.
F	MARLON	Where what started?
F	TRUMAN	Things. Things that don't fit. Loose threads. False steps. Slips of the tongue.
F	MARLON	Make sense, Truman. You going religious on me?
F	TRUMAN	My father didn't want me to see what was over here. Whatever it was, it's gone now. I never shoulda listened to him that day. I knew it was wrong.
F	TRUMAN	There were a hundred people on the beach that day. Everybody knew what was going on except me.
F	MARLON	I don't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you?
F	TRUMAN	Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else. A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a copy of Time Magazine. The week before an ad said, "Next Week: Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".
F	TRUMAN	A guy with the same name as me in Time Magazine. It ain't a common name so I looked out for it. But the day it came out, every newstand was sold out. No library had it. I even wrote off for a back-issue. Never seen a copy to this day.
F	TRUMAN	Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something?
F	MARLON	A coincidence. Haven't you ever heard of a coincidence?
F	TRUMAN	I'm a walking coincidence. I can't count 'em. No something's happening, Marlon. I've got to get to the bottom of it.
F	MARLON	Of what?! Why're you doing this to yourself?
F	TRUMAN	I'm scared, Marlon. I'm as scared as hell. But I've never felt more alive. It's just like she said.
F	MARLON	Who?
F	TRUMAN	It doesn't matter. She was too beautiful for here.
F	TRUMAN	Can you lend me some money? A hundred bucks.
F	MARLON	All I got on me is the takings from the machines. Why do you need it?
F	TRUMAN	I'm going away for a while.
F	MERYL	What's going on, Truman? You're not yourself.
F	TRUMAN	Maybe you just don't know me very well.
F	MERYL	We could do it right here, like we used to.
M	NARRATOR	Travelling Down Under? Global Travel is turning rates to Australia upside down. Round Trip to Sydney only $829. One way, $465. Global Travel at Broadway and 44th...
F	TRUMAN	Lemme go to the bathroom.
F	MERYL	Don't be too long.
M	CHRISTOF	What happened overnight?
F	CHLOE	He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.
M	CHRISTOF	God, that thing of his must be psychic. He didn't masturbate?
F	CHLOE	Not for the last two inonths.
F	MERYL	Aren't you gonna be late?
F	TRUMAN	I got a call in the area. What's the case? Anything interesting?
F	MERYL	Rape on the subway.
F	MERYL	They're guilty as hell but they'll walk. No witnesses. Her word against theirs. Maybe we could meet for lunch today.
M	SECURITY GUARD	You a witness?
F	TRUMAN	Er, yes... No, no I'm not.
M	SECURITY GUARD	Closed session.
F	TRUMAN	I wanna book a flight to Australia.
M	AGENT	Where exactly?
F	TRUMAN	Australia.
M	AGENT	Where in Australia? What city?
F	TRUMAN	Sorry, Sydney. Sydney, Australia. That's right.
M	AGENT	For how many?
F	TRUMAN	One.
M	AGENT	When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, that you do lose a day on the way there?
F	TRUMAN	Today.
M	AGENT	I'm sorry. I don't have anything for a week.
F	TRUMAN	A week.
M	AGENT	It's the busy season.
F	TRUMAN	You sure you're not trying to keep me here? You are a travel agent, aren't you? Your job is to help people travel, not keep 'em where they are. Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?
M	AGENT	I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Australia tomorrow. But you wouldn't want to do that.
F	TRUMAN	Why wouldn't I?
M	AGENT	I thought you were in a hurry.
F	TRUMAN	That's right.
M	AGENT	You want to book the flight?
F	TRUMAN	You were expecting me, weren't you?
M	AGENT	It's non-refundable.
M	PROD. MANAGER	Happy?
M	CHRISTOF	Can we contain him long enough?
M	PROD. MANAGER	I think so.
M	PROD. MANAGER	He flies at night. Thick cloud cover to disorient him. Hopefully we'll knock him out with complimentary cocktails, pull the shades down during the movies. He'll never know.
F	CHLOE	Why go to all the trouble?
M	CHRISTOF	He believes she has the answer.
F	CHLOE	Why not just tell him she's dead?
M	CHRISTOF	It's too late for that. That won't satisfy him. He's going to have to find out for himself. See it with his own eyes. Right now he needs something genuine. Even if we have to fake it.
M	"Please accept my resignation from	American Life & Accident, Inc. to take effect immediately.
F	TRUMAN	"Yours truly..." You spell "truly" "l...y" or "e...l...y"?
M	INSURANCE AGENT	I always write "Yours faithfully..."
M	LAWRENCE	Where the hell have you been, Burbank? What the hell's going on?
F	TRUMAN	That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.
F	TRUMAN	I was just about to resign. Isn't that a laugh? I just realized there's nothing to resign from, is there?
M	LAWRENCE	Listen, don't bother with the resignation. Just get the fuck outta here.
F	TRUMAN	Why're you all pretending? Huh? What is this a front for? Why aren't I in on the joke? Was I away that day?!
F	TRUMAN	I'm talking to you! Who am I?!
M	LAWRENCE	You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.
F	TRUMAN	"Security! I'm calling Security".
F	TRUMAN	You don't believe a single word you're saying! None of you do! You hear me?!
M	SIMEON	...and back to the close-up...
F	CHLOE	Do you think he sees the entry?
M	OPERATOR	Hard to tell.
M	CHRISTOF	Why don't we ask him?
F	CHLOE	I don't know how it got there! Enhance. of the experiences of Truman Burbank
F	TRUMAN	Say my name or I'll smash its head open.
F	TRUMAN	Say my name!
M	YOUNG MOTHER	Please, give him to me...
F	TRUMAN	Say my name! You know my name! Say it!
M	YOUNG MOTHER	I don't know you.
F	TRUMAN	I mean it! I'm ready to do it! What's my name?!!
F	TRUMAN	This is your last chance!
F	TRUMAN	What...is...my...name?!
M	YOUNG MOTHER	Thank you, Truman.
F	TRUMAN	See that car way down there? I bet it's a Suburu station wagon.
F	TRUMAN	I predict the next four cars will be a white Honda Civic, a blue and white Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing, a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle.
F	TRUMAN	There's the Honda...the Dodge...here comes the dented Beetle...
F	TRUMAN	Look, damn you!
F	MERYL	Where's the motorcycle?
F	TRUMAN	Don't you want to know how I did that? Maybe you already know. Is that it?
F	MERYL	Where have you been? I've been calling you all day.
F	TRUMAN	Have you been concerned, Meryl? Nice name. "Meryl". I always liked it.
F	MERYL	Nice of you to say so after eight years.
F	TRUMAN	Actress's name, isn't it? What's your real name?
F	MERYL	Oh, God. What's got into you?
F	TRUMAN	Take a break. Meryl I know.
F	MERYL	I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me...
F	TRUMAN	Drop it, I said. It's over.
F	MERYL	...we need more charcoal.
F	TRUMAN	Shut up!
F	MERYL	I'm gonna take a shower.
F	TRUMAN	No. We're going for a drive.
F	MERYL	What?!
F	TRUMAN	For years I've been saying I want to go some place, well now I'm ready to go. Let's just jump in the car and go.
F	TRUMAN	I thought maybe, Atlantic City.
F	MERYL	You hate gambling.
F	TRUMAN	That's right. I do, don't I?
F	MERYL	So why do you wanna go?
F	TRUMAN	Cos I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it? Cos you're curious. I haven't been curious since I was seven years old, y'know that? Back then you'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place. How long to take Atlantic City out of mothballs?
M	SIMEON	We could be up and running...three hours maybe.
M	CHRISTOF	Give me a number five gridlock on the Jersey Turnpike.
F	TRUMAN	So much traffic, this time of day. Does that strike you as peculiar?
F	TRUMAN	Look at them. You believe they're fighting? I don't believe it. Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic?
F	TRUMAN	Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
F	MERYL	You blaming me for the traffic?
F	TRUMAN	Should I?
F	MERYL	You've never been on this road before. You don't know what it's like.
F	TRUMAN	That's true. We could be stuck here for hours. Could be like this all the way to Atlantic City.
F	MERYL	What the hell are you doing?
F	TRUMAN	You're right. Let's go back. I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.
F	MERYL	Would you please slow down, Truman?
F	MERYL	Truman, that was the turnoff!
F	TRUMAN	I've changed my mind again. What's Maine like this time of year?! I've never been to Maine. Or let's just see where the road takes us.
F	MERYL	Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
F	TRUMAN	I think I'd like a little company.
M	CHRISTOF	What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"? Keep them together.
M	SIMEON	They're rusty. We can't keep up. We don't know where he's going any more.
F	CHLOE	Oncoming is very thin.
F	TRUMAN	Look down there, Meryl!...No cars! I don't run into traffic. The traffic follows me around. We're in a moving pack, don't you see?
M	CHRISTOF	He's so close! It's tantilizing!
F	CHLOE	You want to pull him over?
M	CHRISTOF	No police. Not yet. We shadow him. We don't want him to panic.
F	CHLOE	He's trying to outrun the traffic.
M	CHRISTOF	He's trying to outrun the world. Keep him on this route. Are we ready?
F	TRUMAN	It's hard to go places, isn't it?
F	MERYL	There's been an accident, Truman. We have to go back.
F	TRUMAN	No. There's no accident. It'S just more stalling.
F	TRUMAN	What's going on?
M	OFFICER	Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.
F	TRUMAN	Is there any way around?
M	OFFICER	The whole area's being evacuated. A precaution.
F	MERYL	Truman!! Come back!!
M	CHRISTOF	Did he see it?
F	CHLOE	I don't think so.
F	MERYL	Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
F	TRUMAN	Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
F	MERYL	That's not true.
F	TRUMAN	Don't lie to me!
F	TRUMAN	Tell me what's happening?!
F	MERYL	I thought you knew everything. What could I tell you?
F	TRUMAN	You're part of this, aren't you?!
F	MERYL	Truman, you're scaring me!
F	TRUMAN	No, you're scaring me, Meryl!
F	TRUMAN	Stop this now or I kill your leading lady. I know you can hear me.
M	ROMAN	Get somebody in there!
M	CHRISTOF	No.
M	SIMEON	She's in trouble! We've got to help her!
M	CHRISTOF (O.C.)	He's bluffing. Call his bluff.
F	MERYL	Do something...
F	TRUMAN	Who are you talking to?!
F	MERYL	You're the one talking to the walls!
F	TRUMAN	No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? I swear I'll kill you, if you don't tell me.
F	TRUMAN	How could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me?!
F	TRUMAN	You have any idea what it's like to drown?
F	MERYL	Truman, stop it! Don't let him do it!
F	TRUMAN	I'll kill her!
F	TRUMAN	Right on time. Cops must be telepathic.
F	TRUMAN	Damn!
F	TRUMAN	Stay where you are or I'll kill her!
M	MARLON (O.C.)	Truman? It's me, Marlon.
F	MERYL	They were going to let him kill me!
F	TRUMAN	People know who I am, my every move, complete strangers know my name. Even when there's no one around, I feel the eyes on me.
F	MARLON	I was in the bank today. The Federal on Lewis. A clerk was talking about somebody named Truman messing with her baby. Is that the stranger you're talking about?
F	TRUMAN	No. No. I've never seen her before. I know you already think I'm going out of my mind but I genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow. Everybody seems to be in on it.
F	MARLON	It's a lot of world for one man. You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
F	TRUMAN	That's just it. I think I am somebody.
F	MARLON	I used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room, thinking of ways to fuck me up.
F	TRUMAN	Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes I think it's for real.
F	MARLON	Tru, we've known each other since before we could get a hard-on.
F	MARLON	The only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other's test papers. Jesus, they were identical. I always liked that, because whatever the answer was, we was right together and we was wrong together.
F	MARLON	The only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent together and I wet myself but you never told anyone. I was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didn't talk to me for a month over that and I didn't blame you because you've been more of a brother to me than he's ever been. And I never shoulda let my Goddam father talk me into that.
F	MARLON	I know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Freemont Street all night and dream they would. We all let opportunities pass us by, none of us asks for the dance as often as we should. I know that feeling when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else. But, well, the point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you.
M	CHRISTOF	...and the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you...
F	MARLON	And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it cos there is no it.
F	MARLON	I can't thank you enough. I don't know what happened. He was so close. It threw me. I'm indebted. You are watching "Truman - Total Record Of A Human Life". Everything that occurs here is real. There are no re-creations or interruptions. Due to the live and unedited nature of the program, viewer discretion is advised.
M	INTERVIEWER	Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have been a more momentous week in the show's history. I'm your host, Michael Conners, and this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the forum where we discuss and analyze recent events with the show's award-winning creator and producer, Christof. I remind viewers that as this is a living history, it is our practise to keep the image of Truman on screen at all times. Welcome.
M	CHRISTOF	Thank you.
M	INTERVIEWER	Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in ratings over the last few days, how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?
M	CHRISTOF	Ratings have never been our primary goal. I imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment. However I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.
M	INTERVIEWER	But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
M	CHRISTOF	It has to be the reality.
M	CHRISTOF	We've become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts. no cue cards. It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine. That's how he can support an entire channel.
M	INTERVIEWER	A window onto the human condition?
M	CHRISTOF	I prefer to think of it as a mirror. Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
M	INTERVIEWER	But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
M	CHRISTOF	We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
M	INTERVIEWER	Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
M	INTERVIEWER	Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.
M	MALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)	Hello?
M	INTERVIEWER	You're on, caller. Go ahead.
M	MALE CALLER 1	Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you.
M	CHRISTOF	Thank you.
M	MALE CALLER 1	Truman has never been closer. The way he looked directly at us, spoke to us for the first time. Do you think he'll ever work it out?
M	CHRISTOF	I don't believe so. Not now. He tested his world, as we all do at certain times, and eventually it passed the test. You have to understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world he occupies his only frame of reference. No, for him to come even this close to the truth is a remarkable testament to his instincts.
M	INTERVIEWER	Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk".
M	MALE CALLER 2 (O.C.)	How much of a strain has the last few days placed on the actors?
M	CHRISTOF	Working on "Truman" has always been a huge commitment for an actor, not just in terms of separation from friends and family, but since Truman essentially drives the plot, it's a never-ending improvisation. Recent events have raised the pressure but also the prestige.
M	INTERVIEWER	Of course Truman has always been very much in on casting.
M	CHRISTOF	As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family. Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
M	INTERVIEWER	Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned videographer, Christof.
M	MALE CALLER 3 (O.C.)	Christof. I've admired your work my whole life, although I can't say I've seen it all.
M	CHRISTOF	Who can?
M	MALE CALLER 3	Can you settle an argument for me? What's the longest time Truman has been off-camera?
M	CHRISTOF	In his entire life, forty-two minutes. A technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of that time. The remainder generally results from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman would stray out of range of our cameras.
M	INTERVIEWER	The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them. Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk".
M	FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)	How can you say Truman lives a life like any other?
M	CHRISTOF	I believe that to be so. I often feel the only difference between Truman's life and our own is that his is being more thoroughly documented. --He's not a performer. He's a prisoner.
M	CHRISTOF	--He can leave at any time. If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he were absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him. I think what really distresses you, caller, is that ultimately he prefers the comfort of his "cell"--
M	FEMALE CALLER 1	--No, you're wrong! He'll prove you wrong! He can still do it!
M	CHRISTOF	Do I know you, caller? Your voice sounds familiar.
M	INTERVIEWER	Recording a human life from birth to death, that's still the intention? You still believe Truman has more to contribute?
M	CHRISTOF	More than ever. By unwittingly allowing us to witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing us to evaluate our own lives. He gives us hope.
M	INTERVIEWER	Let's take another call. London, England you're on "Tru Talk".
M	FEMALE CALLER 2	By definition Truman has to be free of censorship, but has the recent violence and profanity caused a problem for the sponsors...?
M	CHRISTOF (O.C.)	What are you looking for?
F	CHLOE	He was premature, wasn't he?
M	CHRISTOF	Only by two weeks.
F	CHLOE	Curious even then? Like he couldn't wait to get started?
M	CHRISTOF	His eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
F	CHLOE	What was it like, the first show?
M	CHRISTOF	The ultimate live television. In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
F	CHLOE	Is it true what you said...on the show tonight? About letting him go if he wanted it badly enough. Would you really do that?
M	CHRISTOF	It won't come to that.
M	CHRISTOF	I hope we've got fresh extras.
F	CHLOE	The rotation was made this morning.
M	CHRISTOF	I don't like the couple with the baby. They'd never be together.
M	CHRISTOF	Who's doing wardrobe? I keep seeing the same wardrobe...
M	CHRISTOF (O.C.)	...everybody back to One...
M	CHRISTOF (O.C.)	...and, action background...
M	CHRISTOF (O.C.)	...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog... let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept together...everybody look like you've got places to go...
M	CHRISTOF	I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.
M	CHRISTOF	...Bodycam Two...
M	CHRISTOF	...streetlight eight...
M	CHRISTOF	...ready, Car-Cam One. Go to One...
M	CHRISTOF	...and cut to interior...
M	CHRISTOF	...looser...
M	CHRISTOF	...and action, Vivien... Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.
M	CHRISTOF	Damn, she missed her mark! Why do we bother with walk-throughs if nobody pays attention? Give me a two-shot of Truman and Vivien...go to the master ...hold the elevators... Vivien, press the elevator button again ...and make sure you catch his eye this time...
M	CHRISTOF	Good! Perfect! Cut to the interior...
M	CHRISTOF	...and Lawrence...
M	CHRISTOF	...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...
M	LAWRENCE	I wouldn't kick her out of bed.
M	CHRISTOF	Regrettably, I have to inform you that Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.
M	CHRISTOF	I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.
M	CHRISTOF	Her separation from Truman will be orchestrated over the summer. However, I'm pleased to announce that television's first on-air conception will still take place. You witnessed the initial contact this morning. You all know Claudia from her work in theatre. Thankfully, Truman doesn't.
M	CHRISTOF	This is a copy of Claudia's back story. Her character's name will be Vivien. She's the new adjuster at the office.
M	CHRISTOF	We intend to entice Truman into the affair as soon as possible. Claudia will make her advance at the seminar Truman's attending next week. Details are in your schedules. I'm sure you'll all make Claudia welcome.
F	MARLON	Question is, will Truman make her welcome?
M	CHRISTOF	I don't have to tell you, how critical the next few weeks will be. This takes us into the next generation. When Truman's child is born, the network will be switching to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.
F	VIVIEN	What happens when Truman and the baby are both on camera together?
M	CHRISTOF	There will simply be duplicate coverage.
F	VIVIEN	Let's just hope we don't have twins.
F	CHLOE	When Truman dies do we go back to the single channel?
M	BARMAN	What's he doing in there?
M	PATRON	Meryl's at her mom's. Maybe he's got an urge.
M	WAITRESS	What's with the coat?
M	BARMAN	Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized.
M	PATRON	Nervous.
M	BARMAN	Oh God, he never bought nothing.
M	WOMAN	Give him a break. It's taken him thirty- four years to get the nerve to go in there.
M	SIMEON	...Ready two. Go to two.
M	SIMEON	And back to the medium.
M	SIMEON	...and wide...
M	OPERATOR	Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?
M	SIMEON	That loser pays our salary.
M	OPERATOR	He's given up on himself again.
M	SIMEON	Who cares? Makes life easier for us. He is what he is.
M	CHRISTOF	When did he start sleeping like that?
M	SIMEON	About the time Meryl left.
M	CHRISTOF	Is that the best shot we can get?
M	SIMEON	What's to see?
M	CHRISTOF	What happened to the room?
M	SIMEON	He started to reorganize. I was going to call you. But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
M	CHRISTOF	I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's insurance convention.
M	CHRISTOF	Give me a shot from his wedding band.
M	SIMEON	He took it off.
M	CHRISTOF	Why is he so still? He's too still.
M	CHRISTOF	Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.
M	CHRISTOF	Give me a preview. An ECU on his torso.
M	CHRISTOF	Phone him.
M	CHRI STOF	Wrong number.
M	CHRISTOF	He didn't drink tonight? No pills?
M	CHRISTOF	Hang up!
M	CHRISTOF	Get Marlon over there.
F	CHLOE	Under what pretext?
M	CHRISTOF	Any fucking pretext!
F	MARLON	Tru!..Tru!..
F	MARLON	I'm comin' in, Tru!
M	CHRISTOF	Cut transmission.
M	CHRISTOF	I said, "Cut"!
M	CHRISTOF	There. Freeze...Zoom into the chair...
M	CHRISTOF	Enhance.
M	CHRISTOF	He wasn't making a mess. He was engineering a blind spot.
F	CHLOE	How does he know where the cameras are?
M	CHRI STOF	I don't know. All I know is we've been filming a blow-up doll for the last three hours.
M	SIMEON	We've declared a curfew. Only the extras required for the search are on the set. Everyone else is at first positions.
M	CHRISTOF	All prop cars accounted for?
M	SIMEON	He has to be on foot. He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.
F	CHLOE	The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug if we don't make a statement within the next hour. The media is in a feeding frenzy. The phone
M	POLICE OFFICER	Any sign of him?
F	TRUMAN	Not yet.
M	POLICE OFFICER	Take it easy.
M	MOSES	Rumors are circulating he's dead.
M	ROMAN	The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.
M	CHRISTOF	Why? We're getting higher ratings for that graphic than any time in the series.
F	CHLOE	When we flush him out how do we explain this?
M	CHRISTOF	We tell him the truth.
M	CHRISTOF	We're making a movie.
M	SIMEON	We'll get him on this next sweep.
M	CHRISTOF	What have we missed?
M	SIMEON	It's just a matter of time.
M	CHRISTOF	No. We've missed something.
M	SYLVIA	You remember when you were a little boy...
M	SYLVIA	...Trust that boy...
M	CHRISTOF	Trust that boy... We're not watching the sea.
M	SIMEON	Why would we?
M	CHRISTOF	Sweep the harbor.
M	SIMEON	That's him!
M	CHRISTOF	Resume transmission.
M	CHRISTOF	What do we have on that boat?
M	CHOPPER PILOT	Alter course immediately. You are entering a restricted area.
F	TRUMAN	Fuck you!
M	YOUNG MAN 1	I knew he wasn't dead. Alter course or we fire on your vessel.
F	TRUMAN	Get the hell away! It's my life!
M	CHRISTOF	Fire a warning.
M	CHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.)	Alter course. Drop your sails.
M	SIMEON	Jesus! God! Is he out of his mind?
M	CHRISTOF	Pull back.
M	CHRISTOF	How long will another chopper take?
M	SIMEON	By the time we pick up the pilots, too long.
M	CHRISTOF	We have to stop him for his own good. Turn him back with the elements.
M	SIMEON	There's no rescue boat in the area. He won't know what to do.
M	MOSES	For God's sake, Chris. The whole world is watching. We can't kill him in front of a live audience.
M	CHRISTOF	He was born in front of a live audience. Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life for the truth. His doubts will turn him back.
M	CHRISTOF	Kill the lights.
F	TRUMAN	I'm coming to find you Sylvia! I'm making myself deaf! You're going to have to kill me! Come on!
M	SIMEON	It's not working. He can sail that thing!
M	ROMAN	How can he sail?! He's in insurance! He hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven!
M	MOSES	On the behalf of the studio, I demand you cease transmission.
M	CHRISTOF	Keep running! I take full responsibility. How close?
M	OPERATOR	Very close.
M	CHRISTOF	Capsize him! Tip him over!
F	CHLOE	You can't! He's tied himself to the wheel. He'll drown!
M	SIMEON	He doesn't care...
F	CHLOE	You lied, you hypocrite! The only way he can leave, is dead!
M	CHRISTOF	Do it!
M	SIMEON	It's too late...
M	OPERATOR	Yeah!
M	GUIDE	...the soundstage roof houses over eight hundred thousand lights of varying intensities
F	TRUMAN	Nobody move! Drive!
F	TRUMAN	Keep talking. Say whatever you say!
M	GUIDE	Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred and fifty million gallons of man-made salt water, temperature-controlled...
F	TRUMAN	
M	CHILD	Please, Mister Truman.
M	CHRISTOF	What do you mean he's not there? We can't have lost him again.
M	GUIDE	...on your left, the control room where the angles are selected and the actors receive direction. Of course, the one place we can't show you is the story department. There is none. ...Truman writes the script...
M	GUIDE	Here he is! It's him!
M	GUARD	We've got him trapped.
M	CHRISTOF	Truman...
F	TRUMAN	Even the stars I wished on...
M	CHRISTOF	You won't do it, Truman. I've watched you your whole life.
F	TRUMAN	You never had a camera in my head.
F	TRUMAN	Something was real! Something had to be real!
