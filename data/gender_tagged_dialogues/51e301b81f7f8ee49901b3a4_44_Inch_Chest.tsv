Told `em all to fuck off out of it and leave me to meet my maker on my Jack Todd!... I lay on my pit like a scabby * baby and waited for it... waited for it... waited for it to come... and get me! It came alright... The Reaper came, alright... in the middle of the fucking night -- Like a burglar -- Like a worry... I opened my milky mince's and saw... saw Death... The ugly brute of it... It's black mouth... it's cocky eyes... `ungry like the wolf... for me!... My time was up! I was wanted!... "I'll break you", it said... "I'll fucking' break you!"... I stared at it... hissed at it... spat at it... I raised myself up from the stainy cot with my weak, bony arm... got myself in a proud position -- my spine ramrod straight... It was reaching for me... grabbing at me... laughing at me... "FUCK YOU!", I said... `FUUUCCKK YOOUU!!!!!"
M	MEREDITH	I've got a new boyfriend... I haven't had a steady in years... He's black, aged 21, beautiful... Works in the city... Ray!... I love that name... Ray!... Met him in a sauna... he looked at me -- I looked at him -- He looked at me... that sort of thing. Just clicked... Got talking... Learnt one or two things about each other... he can't swim -- I like cars, so on and so forth... Took it from there... We've been together three weeks now... Play it by ear... work... I fancied a stroll... `opped on a bus... Hyde Park and I'm walkin'... Serpentine... Past the ducks... I see this rowing boat... man rowin',.. He turns... looks at me... still rowin'... It's him... It's Ray... The boyfriend... We don't acknowledge each other... and I just carry on walking... (pause)... Is he a liar or shouldn't I have been there?... What d'you reckon?... I know what I think!
F	ARCHIE	...I've met someone... Her names `Azel!... I was a bit nervous at first... fear of the unknown I s'pose... well you get set in your ways, don't ya... anyway, I like `er... like `er a lot- `s a nice feelin' -- an' she says she likes me an'' all! -- So you never know -- watch this space!... And Mum an' her? -- Do they get on? CONTINUED: 79 slumped in a chair being tended to by a wild, exotic, gypsy, flamenco-type woman... Nearby, standing alarmed, humiliated and cuckolded wearing a white frilly, puffy- sleeved shirt, red breeches with a gold stripe, black boots, is the shocked faced husband... These three characters bearing an uncanny resemblance to guess who?... ...They get on brilliantly!!... I'm us). Say a prayer for me!
M	COLIN	Be lucky, Liz.
