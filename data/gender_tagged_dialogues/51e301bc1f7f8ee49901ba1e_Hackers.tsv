M	DADE	Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
F	MRS. MURPHY	You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you? Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up again and you won't get into college!
F	MRS. MURPHY	I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year. I didn't want to sell the house but I had to take this new job, you know that. You're going to love New York, it's the city that never sleeps!
M	DADE	Excuse me.
M	KID	Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
M	DADE	Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
M	KID	Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
M	GIRL	Do you have your transfer forms?
M	GIRL	It's a relatively straightforward question.
M	GIRL	Do you speak English?
M	DADE	Sorry, you wanted...?
M	GIRL	I wanted transfer forms.
M	GIRL	Thank you.
M	GIRL	Are you coming?

M	DADE	Thanks!
M	GEEK	Hey! Hold the door!
M	Dade	No pool.
F	KATE	Oh my God! He found the pool.
M	TEACHER	I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms. Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur rally. I know some of you kids got computers at home. But these are school property, people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical interface...

F	JOEY	I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
F	PHREAK	You know, you're right about that. Check it, Friday.
F	JOEY	Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
F	PHREAK	You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
F	JOEY	Ultra Laser. Doctor Doom!
M	CEREAL	Check this out, each and every one of you. Compilation tape, of my own making. I call this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring artists like, well I got some Hendrix on there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit!

M	OPERATOR	Thank you.
F	PHREAK	Nonono, thank YOU!
M	DADE	That's a nice score for a girl.
F	KATE	Think you can do better?
M	DADE	I'll give it a shot.
M	CURTIS	Is this kid bothering you, Kate?
M	DADE	Sorry, can I get some room here?

M	DADE	Who's that?
F	PHREAK	Curtis.
M	DADE	And what's he do?
F	PHREAK	That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
F	PHREAK	What's up?
F	PHREAK	Oh my God. You...
F	PHREAK	Way cool! You saw that?
F	KATE	What the hell is going on?
M	DADE	Pool on the roof must have a leak.
F	PHREAK	Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.
F	KATE	If God gave men brains bigger than dogs', they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail parties.
F	KATE	Ruth Libby.
M	TEACHER	I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a significant author of the twentieth century.
F	KATE	Her last book sold two million copies.
M	CLASS	Woooooo!
M	TEACHER	"Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of the night."
M	DADE	That's Ginsburg.
M	TEACHER	Nice. Very nice.
F	KATE	He's not in this class.
M	DADE	I said give me time.
F	KATE	He's not enrolled in this class.
M	TEACHER	Well, he's on my list.
M	TEACHER	"Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most?"
M	CEREAL	Ozzy Osbourne!
M	TEACHER	You. What is your name?
M	CEREAL	Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?
M	TEACHER	You, however, are not on my list.
M	CEREAL	Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?
F	MRS. MURPHY	How was school?
M	DADE	Hmmm.
F	MRS. MURPHY	What did we learn in school today?
M	DADE	Revenge.
F	MRS. MURPHY	Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
M	DADE	No. No one special.
F	MRS. MURPHY	Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late. And would you try and please fill these out?
F	MRS. MURPHY	Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your life.
M	DADE	Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
F	MRS. MURPHY	And unpack.
M	CEREAL	FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do like absolutely nothing and...
M	CEREAL	...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
F	PHREAK	Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
F	JOEY	Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
F	PHREAK	D'you bring those Crayola books?
M	CEREAL	Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.
M	CEREAL	Green one.
F	JOEY	What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What are these?
M	DADE	International Unix Environments.
M	CEREAL	Luscious orange?
M	DADE	Computer security criteria, DOD standards.
M	DADE	The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover.
M	CEREAL	What's that?
M	DADE	Devil book. The Unix Bible.
M	CEREAL	What's that?
M	DADE	Dragon book. Compiler design.
M	CEREAL	Oh yeah? What's that?
M	DADE	The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
F	JOEY	Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm in this computer, right. So I'm looking around, looking around, you know, throwing commands at it, I don't know where it is or what it does or anything. It's like, it's like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like four hours I'm just messing around in there. Finally I figure out, that it's a bank. Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this morning, I look in the paper, some cash machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out seven hundred dollars into the middle of the street.
M	CEREAL	That's kinda cool.
F	JOEY	That was me. That was me. I did that.
M	DADE	You did this from your house.
F	PHREAK	What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
M	CEREAL	Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
F	JOEY	You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
F	PHREAK	Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
F	JOEY	Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that order, necessarily, right?
M	CEREAL	Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
F	PHREAK	Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
M	CEREAL	Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
F	PHREAK	Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
M	DADE	Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
M	CEREAL	Yeah but oh man, wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
F	PHREAK	Yo, who ate all of my fries?
M	CEREAL	Joey?!
F	JOEY	What, no, nonononono, I didn't touch your fries. I did not touch your fries.
F	PHREAK	Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
M	CEREAL	It was him, man!
F	PHREAK	You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
M	CEREAL	I'm gonna hit you!
F	JOEY	YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy. We're gonna show em baby.
M	HAL	Mr. Belford?
M	PLAGUE	My name is the Plague.
M	HAL	Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
M	PLAGUE	As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
M	HAL	Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
F	JOEY	Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here. Right, uh...
F	JOEY	Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage. anarchist, yet not consciously realizing he sold out that
M	PLAGUE	Never fear. I is here.
M	HAL	I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
M	PLAGUE	Let's echo 23, see what's up.
M	PLAGUE	"God" wouldn't be up this late. "Garbage".
M	PLAGUE	Shit! Get me the switching control center.
M	PLAGUE	I need to trace a call that's in progress.
F	JOEY	Shit! Uh yeah... hold on, mom. Hold on one second.
M	JOEY'S MOM	I mean it! Open the door, Joseph.
F	JOEY	Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.
F	JOEY	There you go.
M	JOEY'S MOM	Bed. Sleep. Now!
M	JOEY'S MOM	Sweet dreams, Joey.
M	HAL	He's gone!
M	PLAGUE	Did you get a trace?
M	OPERATOR	Yeah, we got him.
M	PLAGUE	Good.
M	CEREAL	Nice place, huh.
M	DADE	You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
F	PHREAK	No, don't know who he is. Do you?
F	PHREAK	Nikon! Lord Nikon this is...
M	DADE	Crash Override.
M	NIKON	Never heard of you. Done anything?
M	DADE	No.
F	PHREAK	Come on!
M	NIKON	What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas? Does he know anything?
F	PHREAK	Sure man, he's elite.
M	NIKON	Come in.
M	CEREAL	Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
M	NIKON	Again? Yeah sure.
M	BOTH	Ooka-pow!
M	GILL	Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are terrorists.
M	CEREAL	Agent Richard Gill, You're hacker enemy number one, man. You're a boner!
M	NIKON	Yo, showtime, showtime!
M	DADE	What's going on?
M	ALL BUT DADE	
M	RAZOR	Welcome to our show!
M	BLADE	Hack the Planet!
M	ALL BUT DADE	Hack the Planet!
M	RAZOR	For those late night hacks...
M	BLADE	Jolt Cola! The soft drink of the elite hacker.
M	DADE	Who are these guys?
M	NIKON	That's Razor and Blade.
M	DADE	Razor and Blade.
M	RAZOR	That's right, this IS a payphone.
M	RAZOR AND BLADE	Don't ask.
M	BLADE	As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder. (shows the microcassette recorder) Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
M	RAZOR	Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
M	BLADE	And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
M	RAZOR	...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
M	BLADE	Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
M	SS AGENT	FREEZE!
F	JOEY	What? What? What did I do? What?
M	JOEY'S MOM	Joey!
M	AGENT	Get in there! Sit down!
M	ANOTHER AGENT	Stay down there. Don't move.
F	JOEY	Lucy!
M	JOEY'S MOM	JOEY!!!
M	GILL	How's it going, Ray?
M	AGENT RAY	It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
M	GILL	In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
M	AGENT RAY	I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
M	GILL	Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
M	AGENT RAY	Alright sir.
M	REPORTER	Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your time?
M	GILL	Why of course, Jennifer.
M	JOEY'S MOM	Joey!
F	JOEY	Mom...
M	JENNIFER	Just how dangerous are hackers?
M	GILL	Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses...
M	JOEY'S MOM	Joey!
M	GILL	...and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends. These people, they're terrorists...
M	JOEY'S MOM	Joey!
F	MARGO	Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
M	PLAGUE	Once again, don't call me Eugene. A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
F	MARGO	Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
M	PLAGUE	Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love, sex, secret and... ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
M	PLAGUE	A hacker planted the virus.
F	MARGO	Virus?
M	PLAGUE	Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
F	MARGO	Excuse me?
M	PLAGUE	The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
F	MARGO	What, it left a note?
M	VIRUS	Unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.
M	BOARD MEMBER	Is that...
M	PLAGUE	That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and
M	DUKE ELLINGSON	Well then, put the ships' ballasts under manual control.
M	PLAGUE	There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These ships are totally computerized. They rely on satellite navigation, which links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are in the world.
F	MARGO	So what are we supposed to do?
M	PLAGUE	Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
M	SUIT #1	Now look, now we expect you to get onto this right away, yeah?
M	PLAGUE	Yeah!
M	SUIT #1	Well, how soon?
M	PLAGUE	Well, we're working on it as fast as we can. This is a very common occurrence in corporations as large as ours. You have nothing to worry about.
M	SUIT #2	Yeah, right.
M	SUIT #1	Now, you're sure about that, Mr. The Plague?
M	PLAGUE	Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100 percent. Okay?
M	SUIT #2	Yeah.
M	SUIT #1	Okay.
M	PLAGUE	We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.
F	MARGO	What the hell was that all about?
M	PLAGUE	I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
F	MARGO	What?
M	PLAGUE	I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
F	MARGO	I don't want to go to jail for this.
M	PLAGUE	Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
F	MARGO	But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
M	PLAGUE	Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
F	MARGO	Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
M	PLAGUE	Sh, sh sh sh sh.
M	PLAGUE	I'll take care of this.
M	SECRETARY	Alright, sir.
M	PLAGUE	I can cancel it any time. I don't need any program code. But it's the perfect cover, to confiscate the disc and find out how much of that garbage file has been copied.
F	MARGO	Get it! Why did I ever trust you? Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your toys.
M	GILL	Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
M	PLAGUE	No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
M	GILL	Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
M	SECRET SERVICE AGENT BOB	Unit 3 outside suspect Joey Pardella's apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still grounded... by his mother.
M	AGENT BOB	Listen to this bullshit. "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
M	AGENT RAY	Now that's cool.
M	AGENT BOB	Cool?
M	AGENT RAY	Yeah, cool.
M	AGENT BOB	You think it's cool?
M	AGENT RAY	It's cool!
M	AGENT BOB	It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
M	CEREAL	So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
M	DADE	What is it with this guy?
F	PHREAK	His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
M	CEREAL	Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
F	PHREAK	Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
M	DADE	Did you talk to him?
F	PHREAK	Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends. The secret service is really out to get him. Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
F	PHREAK	It's at Kate's...
F	PHREAK	Thought so!
M	GILL	What the hell are you doing? Plague!
M	GILL	PLAGUE!
M	PLAGUE	Gill.
M	GILL	I think we've got something.
M	PLAGUE	Uuugh, hard copy.
M	PLAGUE	Dade Murphy.
M	AGENT RAY	Secret Service!
M	AGENT BOB	Don't move!
M	DADE	Christ! What is the...
M	AGENT BOB	Shut up!
M	DADE	What are you doing, man? Get off me!
M	AGENT BOB	Just sit in the bed and keep your hands where we can see
M	PLAGUE	The year was 1988. And this nasty virus crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.
M	DADE	Fifteen hundred and seven.
M	AGENT RAY	Wow, huh!
M	GILL	It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
M	PLAGUE	Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
M	GILL	However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
M	PLAGUE	Gill.
M	PLAGUE	Loser. I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
M	DADE	I'm sorry. Who are you?
M	PLAGUE	I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
M	DADE	Nah. I don't play well with others.
M	DADE	Shit! Come on!
M	PLAGUE	Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
M	PLAGUE	I'll be in touch.
M	PLAGUE	I'm fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
M	DADE	Blow me.
M	PLAGUE	Thank you!
F	PHREAK	Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae"
M	DADE	That explains a lot.
F	PHREAK	Yo, what's up Nikon!
M	NIKON	Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it. Houston, we have liftoff, 3 o'clock, check it... don't look right away, what's wrong with you! Look at her man...
M	NIKON	Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St.,
M	DADE	How did you know that?
M	NIKON	I got photographic memory. It's a curse! Lisa!
M	LISA	Hey, how do you know my name?
M	CEREAL	Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right!
F	VICKIE	Hi, my name is Vickie, and I'm an addict.
M	HANK	Hi, my name is Hank, and uh, I'm an addict.
F	JOEY	Uh, my name's Joey but, uh, I'm not an addict.
F	JOEY	Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this. I got in trouble with my computer, right, okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer! No really, really,
F	JOEY	I'm not an addict. I'm not, I'm not.
F	JOEY	Can I get some more coffee?
F	PHREAK	Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
M	DADE	Yeah? Display?
M	CEREAL	Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
M	NIKON	I want it.
F	PHREAK	I want it to have my children!
M	CEREAL	Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
F	PHREAK	Yo, hit the lights.
M	DADE	Shit!
M	CEREAL	Shh!
M	DADE	Was that her top?
F	PHREAK	One-handed!
M	CEREAL	Difficulty rating?
M	NIKON	Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
M	DADE	Burn!
M	NIKON	What the f...
F	KATE	Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
F	PHREAK	I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
M	NIKON	Yeah, it's hyped, you know... you're in the butter zone now, baby.
F	PHREAK	Uh-huh!
F	KATE	Yeah, it is... I wanna triple the RAM...
M	CURTIS	Oooh, Leopard Boy... AND the Decepticons. Uh, Kate, Kate, you're not going into that computer shit now, right?
M	CURTIS	Humm, yeah.
M	CEREAL	Right.
M	DADE	The sensitive type.
F	KATE	What is he doing in here?
F	PHREAK	Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
M	DADE	Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
F	KATE	What?
M	DADE	I'm Crash Override.
F	KATE	You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
M	CEREAL	Whoa, whowhowhowhoa. Crash... and Burn!
F	MARGO	Murphy kid turn you down?
M	PLAGUE	I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
F	MARGO	Pervert! What are you talking about?
M	PLAGUE	The FBI computer holds files on twenty million
F	MARGO	Congratulations.
M	PLAGUE	From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
F	MARGO	So?
M	PLAGUE	So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
F	KATE	What the hell are you doing?
M	DADE	It's cool, I'm just looking.
F	KATE	It's too much machine for you.
M	DADE	Yeah?
F	KATE	I hope you don't screw like you type.
M	DADE	It has a killer refresh rate.
F	KATE	P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
M	DADE	Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
F	KATE	Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
M	DADE	Yeah. RISC is good.
M	DADE	You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
F	KATE	Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
M	DADE	Yeah.
F	KATE	Are you challenging me?
M	DADE	Name your stakes.
F	KATE	If I win, you become my slave.
M	DADE	Your slave?
F	KATE	You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
M	DADE	And if I win?
F	KATE	Make it my first born.
M	DADE	Make it our first date.
F	KATE	You're not gonna win.
M	DADE	And you have to smile.
F	KATE	I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
F	PHREAK	So here's the deal. The chosen contest: To hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and get one back for Joey.
M	NIKON	Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1. No appeals.
M	CEREAL	The duel will last until we declare a winner.
F	PHREAK	Use only the dialups, access codes and passwords in your collection. Can't ask for any help from us.
M	DADE	Talking to me?
F	PHREAK	Any questions?
F	KATE	Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin? MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's
F	KATE	Alright, he's in the personal ads. "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace, and water sports. Transvestites welcome."
M	GILL	I... I... I know where you can stick it... I know where you can stick it...
M	CALLER	...wanna lick your earlobes... I wanna lick your lips... I wanna lick your toes... I wanna lick your ankles...
M	GILL	Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this.
M	CALLER	That's why they call me Stallion...
M	GILL	Aw, that's disgusting!
M	CALLER	My heart is steaming for you...
M	CALLER	...spank you with my...
M	GILL	Aww, Spank your ass...
M	PLAGUE	Animal!
M	GILL	Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am?
M	EMPLOYEE	This is accounting, sir. You enquired about an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?
M	GILL	Yes.
M	EMPLOYEE	Our records indicate he's deceased.
M	GILL	I'm what?
M	DADE	Dead.
F	PHREAK	Dead?
M	DADE	Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
M	NIKON	Very impressive.
M	CEREAL	Super hero like even.
F	KATE	Yeah, whatever. What's the score?
F	PHREAK	Tie.
F	PHREAK	Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
M	DADE	Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
F	KATE	And if I win, so do you.
M	DADE	Deal.
F	KATE	Oooohhhh...
F	KATE	Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.
F	KATE	You are man enough to stick with the deal, aren't you?
M	DADE	Thanks.
M	PLAGUE	You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well let me explain the New World Order. Governments and corporations need people like you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard cowboys. And all those other people out there who have no idea what's going on are the cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh, think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"! Tell me where the disk is.
M	JOEY'S MOM	You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not grounded anymore.
F	PHREAK	Yo, what's up?
F	JOEY	Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
F	PHREAK	Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
F	JOEY	Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
F	PHREAK	Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.
F	JOEY	I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
F	PHREAK	Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.
F	JOEY	Shit!
M	GILL	I'm watching you...
M	PHREAK'S MOM	Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano. Time for school, come on.
M	AGENT	Secret Service, don't move!
F	PHREAK	Deja vu!
M	AGENT BOB	Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
F	PHREAK	What are you waiting for, arrest me already!
M	COP	You get one call. Uno. Understand?
M	OPERATOR	Hello, operator services.
F	PHREAK	Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
M	OPERATOR	What number please?
F	PHREAK	
M	OPERATOR	Just one moment.
F	PHREAK	Thank you.
F	KATE	Hello?
F	PHREAK	Hey, it's me.
F	KATE	Phreak?
F	PHREAK	I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
F	KATE	You think they're going to bust us?
F	PHREAK	Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
F	MRS. MURPHY	Hi! Well, now I see what all the fuss is about. Dade... you have company.
M	CEREAL	It's a nice room.
F	KATE	We need your help.
M	DADE	Do my ears deceive me?
M	CEREAL	Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
F	KATE	Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
M	DADE	I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
M	CEREAL	Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
F	KATE	What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
M	DADE	I'm sorry, I can't.
F	KATE	Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
F	MRS. MURPHY	Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Cereal has.
F	KATE	Thank you.
M	DADE	Okay. I'll copy it.
F	KATE	Okay, thank you.
M	PLAGUE	The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
M	DADE	I told you, I don't play well with others.
M	PLAGUE	Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
M	PLAGUE	Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
M	DADE	That's bullshit.
M	PLAGUE	What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
M	DADE	You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
M	PLAGUE	Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
M	PLAGUE	Talk to me.
M	DADE	I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
M	PLAGUE	Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
M	DADE	Kate, listen.
F	KATE	Uh, hold on...
M	DADE	I have to tell you something.
M	CEREAL	Hold on a second!
M	NIKON	Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
M	CEREAL	Looks like a hacker wrote it.
F	KATE	Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.
M	NIKON	But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This is taking forever and a day to figure out. I'm gonna make some coffee.
M	CEREAL	Tag, you're in.
M	DADE	This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
M	NIKON	What's this one eat?
M	DADE	It nibbles. You see this?
M	DADE	This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
F	KATE	The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
M	DADE	And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
F	KATE	Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out
M	DADE	Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
F	KATE	Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
M	NIKON	Two days.
M	DADE	And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
M	CEREAL	21.8 million bucks, man.
F	KATE	Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
M	DADE	I know, I know who wrote it.
F	KATE	What?
M	DADE	This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
F	KATE	You what?
M	DADE	I didn't know what was on it.
M	CEREAL	Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
M	NIKON	Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
F	KATE	Why did he come to you?
M	DADE	I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
M	NIKON	Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven systems in one day?
M	NIKON	Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
M	CEREAL	That's far out!
M	NIKON	This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
F	KATE	Well that's great. There goes MIT.
M	DADE	I'll make it up to you!
F	KATE	How?
M	DADE	I'll hack the Gibson.
M	NIKON	They'll trace you like that man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
M	DADE	Fucked if I care, man.
M	NIKON	Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
M	CEREAL	Oh wow, we are fried.
F	KATE	Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
M	CEREAL	You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
M	NIKON	Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
M	DADE	Okay. Let's go shopping.
M	CEREAL	Woo hoo! Boom!
M	DADE	You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of honor, I might take advantage of this situation. Erotically, as it were.
M	GUARD	Alright, hold it right there!
M	DADE	Shit!!
F	KATE	It's my subway defense system.
M	NIKON	He's way down there.
M	CEREAL	Ta-da!
M	NIKON	Yo, brain dead, the manual!
M	PHONE COMPANY TECH	Hey!
M	CEREAL AND NIKON	TRUCK!!!
M	WOMAN	Find it?
M	CEREAL	Phone's alright. The problem must be somewhere else.
F	MARGO	They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
M	PLAGUE	Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
F	MARGO	You said the worm was untreaceable!
M	PLAGUE	Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
F	MARGO	Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
M	PLAGUE	No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
M	PLAGUE	Look, there is no right and wrong. There is only fun and boring. A thirty year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me. Who do you prefer serves it, us? Or them?
M	VIRUS	Unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet.
M	PLAGUE	The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30, and those hackers tried to get into our system again. At this point I insist you take more strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible.
M	GILL	Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer, Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.
M	CEREAL	Snoop onto them...
M	NIKON	...as they snoop onto us.
F	KATE	Yeah, it's Kate.
M	NIKON	Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.
F	KATE	Alright, so what have we got?
M	DADE	Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
M	NIKON	Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
M	CEREAL	Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
M	DADE	What?
M	CEREAL	Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
F	KATE	What oil spills?
M	NIKON	Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the thirteenth.
M	CEREAL	Well this hasn't happened yet.
F	KATE	Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look... "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
M	NIKON	Damn!
M	CEREAL	A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
M	NIKON	Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going, huh?
F	KATE	I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right, till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay? Are you coming?
M	CEREAL	May the Force be with you, man.
F	KATE	There they are!
M	DADE	Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
F	KATE	They're elite! Let's get 'em.
F	KATE	I lost 'em. Where were you?
M	DADE	I don't like this.
M	DADE	AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!
M	BLADE	What do you want?
M	DADE	Ummm... we come in peace?
F	KATE	We need your help. If you're up to it.
M	RAZOR	She's buff. Ballsy.
M	BLADE	Let's keep her.
M	RAZOR	Waste the dude.
F	KATE	A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
M	DADE	It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
F	KATE	We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
M	RAZOR	She's rabid, but cute.
M	BLADE	See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
M	DADE	Let's go, Kate.
M	RAZOR	Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to need more than just two media icons like us. You need an army.
M	BLADE	That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
M	RAZOR	Hackers of the World, Unite!
M	BLADE	How are you going to take care of the cops?
M	GRAND CENTRAL	HACK THE PLANET
M	CEREAL	Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand Central. Let's hit it!
M	CEREAL	Hey Joey, you made it!
F	KATE	Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us time, we have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm.
M	CEREAL	Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
F	KATE	Cereal.
M	CEREAL	Yeah?
F	KATE	Go fix the phones.
M	CEREAL	Roger.
F	KATE	Joey, take his place.
F	JOEY	What, me?
F	KATE	Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.
F	KATE	Ready?
M	DADE	Yeah.
F	KATE	Alright, let's boot up.
F	MARGO	What is it? What's wrong?
M	PLAGUE	Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
F	MARGO	"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
M	HAL	There's a new virus in the database.
F	MARGO	What's happening?
M	HAL	It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
M	PLAGUE	Type "Cookie", you idiot. I'll head 'em off at the pass.
M	HAL	We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
M	PLAGUE	Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
M	PLAGUE	Die, dickweeds!
M	HAL	The rabbit is in the administration system.
M	PLAGUE	Send a Flu-shot.
F	MARGO	Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
M	HAL	A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
F	MARGO	Cancer?
F	KATE	It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
M	DADE	Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
M	PLAGUE	They're at Grand Central Station, lower level. Don't screw up.
M	PLAGUE	Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence. You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
M	DADE	Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
M	PLAGUE	Give it up! Just give it up.
M	RAZOR	Are we fashionably late?
M	SYSOP	We have massive infection. Multiple GPI and
M	HAL	They're coming in from remote nodes. They're going after the Kernal!
F	MARGO	Colonel who?
M	HAL	The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
F	MARGO	Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
M	DUKE ELLINGSON	Belford, what's going on?
M	PLAGUE	In short, Duke, a shit storm.
M	DADE	I found it! I found it!
M	PLAGUE	This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling!
M	DADE	Oh, shit! He got me.
M	NIKON	Joey's getting stupid busy.
M	DADE	Joey. I need you to drop your viruses, go after the worm. You're the closest.
M	DADE	It's root slash period workspace slash period garbage period.
M	GILL	Freeze!
M	GILL	Ahhh Come on!
F	KATE	Kill the Gibson.
M	RAZOR	Roger that.
M	PLAGUE	Come on you son of a bitch, is that all you got, huh? Come on, let's see what else you can do! You talking to me? Huh? Hahahaha. Are you nuts? Come at me!
M	HAL	They're in the kernal.
M	DA VINCI VIRUS	Help... me...
M	WOMAN	The tankers have stopped capsizing.
M	SOMEONE ELSE	Ballast tanks are emptying. It'll be okay. WE GOTCHA! DIE LIKE THE REST
M	PLAGUE	Little pissant!
M	NIKON	Yes!
M	DADE	We did it!
F	KATE	Let's get out of here! FREEZE!
M	DADE	They're TRASHING our rights, man! They're TRASHING the flow of data! They're TRASHING! THE PLANET!
M	GILL	Shut up and get in the car!
M	CEREAL	HACK THE PLANET! HACK THE PLANET!
M	PLAGUE	Hello?
M	GILL	We caught 'em.
M	PLAGUE	Good.
M	GILL	Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
M	DADE	Me, alright? I did it. She knows shit about computers. She... she's just my girlfriend.
M	GILL	I suggest you modify your attitude. Because you are floating. And I'm about to flush your ass.
M	AGENT	You've got a Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir.
F	KATE	Are you crazy? What are you doing?
M	DADE	I'm trying to help you.
F	KATE	Dade.
M	DADE	What?
F	KATE	Thanks for your help.
M	GILL	Your son is in big trouble. He has violated his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity.
F	MRS. MURPHY	My son happens to be a genius. He understands something happening today that you won't comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he would never use what he knows to harm a living soul.
M	AGENT BOB	The news crew you requested is here.
F	MRS. MURPHY	Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell them.
M	GILL	Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that.
F	MRS. MURPHY	Mister, I don't care if I face certain death.
M	GILL	Mrs. Murphy stays right here.
F	KATE	Oh, wow, she's great.
M	DADE	Yeah.
M	REPORTER	...and attacked the Ellingson's computer network. Is the last we've seen of this type of high-tech espionage?
M	GILL	Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave threat to the national security. This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop...
M	SOMEONE	That kid cut him off!
M	CEREAL	Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal Killer, making my first coast to coast, world wide, global television appearance. Yes, that's right, I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral.
M	CEREAL	But for what, you ask? World domination? Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen, right. What could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program?
M	CEREAL	But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks. The password for this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head of public relations at Ellingson Mineral...
F	MARGO	Oh my God!
M	CEREAL	...and Eugene Belford, Computer Security Officer.
M	GILL	Son of a BITCH!
M	CEREAL	What's this? Is this the unnamed account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I think so!
M	CEREAL	Yo. I kinda feel like God!
F	MARGO	Plague? Eugene?
F	MARGO	I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford! I know where his mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need a lawyer!
M	STEWARDESS	Here you are, Mr. Babbage. Flight time to Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I get you anything else?
M	PLAGUE	Just a pillow please.
M	PLAGUE	Thank you.
M	GILL	You're welcome.
M	PLAGUE	What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
M	DADE	You look good in a dress.
F	KATE	You would have looked better.
M	DADE	Wanna go for a swim?
F	KATE	I can't believe they decided you won.
M	DADE	They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
F	KATE	Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
M	C B	R A U A N R S D N H
M	DADE	Beat that!
M	DADE	You know, I've been having these really weird..
F	KATE	Dreams?
