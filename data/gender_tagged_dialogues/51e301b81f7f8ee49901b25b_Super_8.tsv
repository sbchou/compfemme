M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	I'm so worried for that boy.
M	CHARLES' FATHER	Joe's gonna be okay.
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	...she was everything to him.
M	CHARLES' FATHER	Jack's gonna step up. He's a good man.
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	But he was never really a father...I don't think he ever...understood Joe.
M	CHARLES' FATHER	Joe's gonna be okay.
M	CARY	What do you think was in the coffin?
M	MARTIN	Jesus, shut up.
M	CARY	I mean cause of how she died.
M	CARY (CONT'D)	... you weren't wondering that?
M	PRESTON	No, I'm eating macaroni salad.
M	CHARLES	I was thinking that, about the coffin.
M	MARTIN	I don't know how you guys can eat.
M	CHARLES	Try a Goddamn turkey roll and you'll discover how. They're delicious.
M	CARY	Either nothing was in there, or like whatever they scraped up--
M	MARTIN	Jesus -- guys--
M	CHARLES MARTIN	I heard it crushed her completely. At least keep your voices DOWN--
M	PRESTON CHARLES	A steel beam-- those things weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I would not be eating right now. Despite the turkey rolls. Hey-- Lucy.
M	CHARLES	Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my movie anymore.
M	CARY	Why?
M	CHARLES	Why do you think why? The story. It's about the living dead.
M	PRESTON	His mother's not a zombie.
M	CHARLES	But she's dead, shithead.
M	CARY	Those turkey rolls are pretty good.
M	CHARLES	Told you.
M	JACK	I'll be home soon.
M	CHARLES	That was the longest day ever-- here.
M	JOE	What's this?
M	CHARLES	New scene, check it out. Let's hit the 7.
M	JOE	You hear Martin barfed in the hall?
M	CHARLES	I know, does that guy ever not barf? Keep reading.
M	JOE CHARLES	-- I am reading. -- Not carefully. Focus, this is important. -- Detective Hathaway has a wife?
M	CHARLES (CONT'D)	I think it might help make my movie better. I need two things: a better story and production value.
M	CARY CHARLES	Martin booted all over his locker, it was the grossest one yet-- Let Joe focus, he's reading.
M	CARY CHARLES	After he ate two boxes of Mike and Ikes-- never seen so many colors in my life. Will you shut up a minute?
M	JOE	Who's gonna play the wife, Jen?
M	CHARLES	No way -- did I tell you what she did with my top hat?
M	JOE	Oh yeah, that was bad.
M	CARY	What wife?
M	CHARLES	Alice Dainard.
M	CHARLES	I was returning that book on codes and ciphers-- she was in the silent reading section -- I thought, "Screw it." So I asked her if she'd play Hathaway's wife.
M	JOE	You talked to Alice Dainard really?
M	CARY	You're not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section--
M	CHARLES CARY	Shut up. It's for "silent reading."
M	CHARLES	She said yes, we're filming tonight and she's driving.
M	JOE	-- driving where? To the train depot -- did you not read the scene I just gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is she old enough? Whose car are we taking? Are you making this up?
M	CHARLES	Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to drive and I accepted--
M	CARY	Can I see --?
M	JOE	-- was she nice? Why is she doing this? I don't understand, we don't even know her--
M	CHARLES	Maybe she just wants to be in a good movie, y'ever think of that?
M	JOE	I don't think that's what it is--
M	CHARLES	I've been working on this movie for months. I'm just trying to make it good.
M	CARY	Hathaway's married now? Really?
M	JOE	What was she reading?
M	CHARLES	... what?
M	JOE	In the silent reading section, what was Alice reading?
M	CHARLES	Who gives a rat's ass what she was reading-- the festival deadline's in one week -- my movie's gotta be great!
M	JACK	That was a good zombie murder.
M	CHARLES	Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you for that-- it's not a story yet. Older kids enter this film festival -- I'm competing with fifteen- and sixteen-year-olds, who have better stories and cars and production value, I've got nothing!
M	CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)	Charles! Dinner!
M	CHARLES	I'm coming! There's a whole article in there about stories, you should read it, it explains everything.
M	JOE	I don't understand how the wife makes it a story--
M	CHARLES CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)	Jesus, that's what I've been explaining: in the scene we're filming tonight, the wife telling the detecting she's scared for him, that she loves him-- Charles! -- I'M COMING!!! -- so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares -- you'll feel something -- because you don't want him to die because they love each other! Does that make sense? I just can't believe you talked to Alice Dainard.
M	CHARLES	You're impossible. CHARLES!
M	CHARLES	GOD, MOM! I'M COMING! Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.
M	JOE	I won't forget.
M	CHARLES	Read this.
F	JEN	Mom, it's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's. Every single person is going except me!
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Then every single person can tell you how it was --
M	CHARLES' FATHER	Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
F	JEN	MOM---
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	It's your turn to babysit.
F	JEN	So...
F	PEG	Get off that thing.
F	JEN	Mom, why can't I switch with Charles?
M	CHARLES	Because you crushed Charles' top hat, you ever think of that?
F	JEN	Oh, really, guess what? We're switching. Charles grabs a roll.
M	CHARLES	Guess what, no we're not.
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Charles take these to the table! Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey, JOE--
M	JOE	Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk--
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Grab a seat, we have lots of food.
M	JOE	Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay. "See you tomorrow."
M	CHARLES	Later days.
M	CHARLES' FATHER	There's always a place for you here, you know that--
M	JOE	Oh, yessir. Thank you.
M	JACK	Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--
M	JACK	It's a six-week program, hands-on training with college coaches. You'll like it. I know I did.
M	JOE	I thought I was going to have the summer for myself--
M	JACK	Things have obviously changed for us. And it'd be good for you to spend some time with kids who don't run around with-- cameras and MONSTER MAKE-UP--
M	JOE	I gotta help Charles finish his movie.
M	JACK	I have nothing against your friends. I like your friends. Except Cary, who can't stop lighting things on fire. You'll like it there. It's what we both need.
M	CHARLES (V.O.)	Okay, it's time -- don't get caught, over.
M	JOE	I won't. Over.
M	CHARLES (V.O.)	Wanna hear something gross? I do.
M	MARTIN (V.O.)	No please, if you're really asking.
M	CHARLES	I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit my pants. I debated telling you.
M	JOE	Thanks.
M	PRESTON	That's called a "sharteeze" by the way.
M	CHARLES CARY	Well then I totally sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm talking about: the world is crazy, there's a name for everything...
M	CHARLES	Twizzler me.
M	MARTIN	So... people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory, right?
M	CHARLES	Martin? I don't see how the guy playing Detective Hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from.
M	CARY	Another classic from Smartin.
M	MARTIN	I told you, I don't like it when you call me that.
M	CARY	I'm sorry, Smartin.
M	MARTIN	Shut up.
M	JOE	
F	ALICE	Joe Lamb?!
M	JOE	-- yeah?
F	ALICE	What the hell's he doing here?
M	CHARLES	Make-up, sound and special effects.
F	ALICE	He's the deputy's kid!
M	CHARLES JOE	-- you knew that?
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Charles, I don't have a license. I can't drive with him!
M	CHARLES	You want Joe to-- stay back? I--?
F	ALICE	It's too late! He's seeing me in this car right now.
M	JOE	You can trust me. My dad'll never know. I won't tell him anything.
F	ALICE	Get in. You're driving very well. I'm impressed.
M	CHARLES	So I wrote a couple new lines, can I show you?
F	ALICE	What?
M	MARTIN	New lines? Charles-- what, I have new lines?
M	CHARLES	Shut up. There aren't a lot--
F	ALICE	I'm sorta trying to drive--
M	CHARLES	What would be great is: could you cry during the scene? Can you do that?
F	ALICE	... no...?!
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	Stop.
M	CARY	You know the first place I'm gonna drive when I get my license?
M	JOE	Want one?
M	CARY	New Castle, Pennsylvania. Fireworks capital of America.
M	MARTIN	So I don't have any new lines, right? Because I just learned these.
M	CHARLES	Shut up.
M	PRESTON	I have never been a passenger in a vehicle without an adult driving. I'm unresolved as to how I feel about it.
M	CHARLES	Guys, there's an electrical socket up here.
M	MARTIN	Hey, Charles, Charles, do I have more lines?
M	CHARLES	No. But you can pick up some stuff. Guys, this is going to be great. Get the lights and camera on that end, we'll shoot this direction first, like we talked about! Joe, get the mike plugged in-- make sure the new batteries are in the camera before you do the make-up!
M	JOE	Okay.
M	MARTIN	"-- Sweetheart, this is my job, I have no choice." "That's nothing you need to worry about..." "What am I suppose to go to Michigan with you..."
M	MARTIN (CONT'D)	No, no, no. Cary.
M	CARY	I took apart two packs of cherry bombs and made my own M-80.
M	PRESTON	Your obsession with fireworks -- and I'm saying this as a friend -- concerns me. And my mother.
M	CARY	Well you're a pussy. And your mom has one.
M	MARTIN	Bogus, Cary.
M	CHARLES	Martin, I have a new line for you.
M	JOE	You mind?
F	ALICE	My dad works at the mill.
M	JOE	Close you eyes. Please.
M	CHARLES (O.S.)	So this is very emotional.
M	CHARLES	Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investiga--
F	ALICE	I know, we read it, we get it.
M	CHARLES	Okay, I'm just directing. Martin get on your mark. Martin, you're going to have to reassure her. Do you know what "reassure her" means?
M	MARTIN	Yeah, I think so.
M	CHARLES	Okay-- we're starting on Alice's side first-- Preston: a couple seconds after "action" walk to the pay phone, make it look like this place is busy--
M	PRESTON	I know what that looks like.
M	CHARLES	Asshole, could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera?
M	CARY	Sorry man.
M	CHARLES	Let's rehearse this -- save your real performances for when we're filming, though.
M	CHARLES (CONT'D)	Ready? Here we go... action!
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you leave town.
M	MRS. HATHAWAY	John. I don't like it. This case. These murders.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
M	MRS. HATHAWAY	Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	Sweetheart. This is my job.
M	MRS. HATHAWAY	The dead, coming back to life...? I think you're in danger--
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	I have no choice--
M	MRS. HATHAWAY	You do have a choice. We all do...
M	MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)	John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away.
M	MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)	But I'm asking you now-- please. For me. Don't go back. Don't leave me. I need to know this isn't the last time I'll see you. I just love you so much.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	... I... I love you too...
F	ALICE	Was that okay? Or... not really?
M	CHARLES	-- uh, that was... I'm... that-- yeah, good. Just like that.
M	CHARLES (CONT'D)	PRODUCTION VALUE!!! Is there film in the camera?!
M	CARY	-- I didn't put it in--
M	CHARLES	PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get the mike ready. Go, go, Preston, get in position. Costume, costume. Martin, get that tripod set up. Joe, help her with her costume. Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't miss the train. Preston, get in position! Martin, you know you lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE CAMERA YET?!
F	ALICE	I love how calm he is.
M	JOE	Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy.
M	CHARLES	Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud when the train passes by! Oh God, I hope it stops! You ready?! And... ACTION!
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you left town for a couple of days.
M	MRS. HATHAWAY	John. I don't like it. This case. These murders.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
M	MRS. HATHAWAY	Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	Sweetheart. This is my job. THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER!
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	I HAVE NO CHOICE!!! YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!! John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away.
M	MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)	But I'm asking you now-- please. For me. Don't go back. Don't leave me. I need to know this isn't the last time I'll see you. I just love you so much.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	I love you too!!
M	JOE CHARLES	GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?!
M	JOE	Run!
M	JOE (CONT'D)	Alice!
M	CHARLES	Joe, we have to go. They run off. I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!
M	JOE (O.S.)	Guys?!
M	JOE (CONT'D)	Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is that you?
M	PRESTON	I'm okay! Though I think I'm having a heart attack! And I have a scrape!
M	CARY	Guys, did you see those explosions? That was awesome.
M	JOE	Has anyone seen Alice?!
M	CHARLES (O.S.)	I'm alive! Is anyone dead?
M	CHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON	-- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...
M	MARTIN CARY	-- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit... -- what's all that blood?
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	What's the blood? -- did someone get hurt--?
M	KIDS (AD LIB)	Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't touch -- what are you-- careful!
M	JOE	It's my fake blood. It's fake!
M	CHARLES	What is this stuff? ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices
M	PRESTON	Guys, what are these things?
M	MARTIN	Hey, don't touch it, what are you doing?
M	CHARLES	They look like white Rubik's cubes or something. They're heavy like metal or something. There's like a billion of them.
M	CARY	Guys, get up here. You can see everything from up here.
M	CHARLES CARY	Oh my God. ... Look at that...
M	PRESTON	According to my Uncle Seth, an accident like this is exceptionally rare.
M	JOE	It wasn't an accident. There was a truck. On the tracks.
M	CHARLES	What? Driving on the tracks?
M	JOE	There.
M	MARTIN	How can a pick-up truck derail a train? That's impossible.
M	PRESTON	Obviously it isn't.
M	CARY	... holy shit...
M	CHARLES	-- is that him?
F	ALICE	-- yeah, it's him--
M	MARTIN	-- who?
M	PRESTON CHARLES	It is, yeah, for sure-- Holy shit. What? Who is that?
F	ALICE	Dr. Woodward...?
M	MARTIN	That's Dr. Woodward? The science guy?
M	PRESTON	Biology.
M	CARY	Honors biology.
M	MARTIN	Wow... I'm not in his class.
M	CARY	We know.
M	MARTIN	Shut up, Cary.
M	CHARLES	Remember when Old Man Woodward took your Electronic Football?
M	CARY	Yeah, he put it in the "dungeon," never gave it back...
M	MARTIN	The dungeon?
M	PRESTON	That trailer Woodward keeps in the school parking lot.
F	ALICE	... Dr. Woodward?
M	PRESTON JOE	Map of the contiguous United States... -- what's the writing?
M	ALICE (CONT'D) CHARLES	-- dates and times. -- what's that line across?
M	JOE	It's a schedule for the train.
M	DR. WOODWARD	-- who-- who are you?
M	CHARLES	Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk! From fourth period! You've been in an accident!
M	DR. WOODWARD	They will kill you. Do not speak of this -- or you -- and your parents - - will die.
M	JOE	-- guys, look --
F	ALICE	-- we shouldn't be here-- GOOOOOOOOO!!!
M	PRESTON CHARLES	My dad will de-ball me! Let's get out of here!!!
F	ALICE	MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!!
M	CHARLES PRESTON	Holy shit, that was insane! He had a gun! An actual physical gun!
M	CARY CHARLES	I can't believe all that just happened here! Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like
M	PRESTON	My heart is pounding! That train could of killed us.
M	JOE	Are you okay?
M	CHARLES	Oh shit, all the glass just fell out!
M	MARTIN	I HAVE NEVER HAD A TEACHER AIM A GUN AT ME!
F	ALICE	It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling!
M	JOE	Guys, keep it down!
M	CARY JOE	Joe: what was Woodward talking about? I don't know, I don't know--
M	MARTIN	I'm never taking a train again.
M	PRESTON	"You'll die, your parents will die," guys, that is not good information.
M	CHARLES	Great, the focus ring just fell off!
M	CARY	No one cares about your CAMERA!
M	MARTIN	Am I the only one shaking?! I'm also crying --
F	ALICE	We can't tell anyone we were there - - we can't say a thing about it -- my dad cannot find out I took his car, do you guys hear me?!
M	JOE	It's okay-- no one's saying anything. None of us. Guys -- we're not gonna say anything -- are we?!
M	JOE (CONT'D)	See? No one's gonna know.
F	ALICE	Joe, this is yours.
M	JOE	-- oh, thanks,
F	ALICE	I should never have done this.
M	JACK JOE	Gotta head in early -- -- okay-- Make sure you let Lucy out. -- I will --
M	JACK JOE	You gonna -- what, you with Charles today? Yeah, I'll be with Charles-- Make sure you get the yard. -- okay, I will.
M	Jack heads off.	
F	JEN	Mom, come on!
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	No. You're not wearing that. No one in this house is wearing that.
F	JEN	Compared to Debbie's these are long.
M	CHARLES' FATHER	Just listen to your mother.
F	JEN	I can't wear these or go to Wendy's party? This is not fair.
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa.
F	JEN	Mom's racist.
F	PEG	Are there anymore English muffins?
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	I don't know, go check.
M	CHARLES' FATHER	Peg, tell the twins to stop.
F	PEG	They don't listen to me.
M	CHARLES' FATHER	Hi, Joe.
M	JOE	Morning, Mr. Kaznyk--
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Hi, Joe. Did you hear about the train accident?
M	JOE	Uh... no.
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	It's on the news.
M	CHARLES	Can you believe this?
M	JOE	No.
M	CHARLES	It's on the news. That means it's real.
M	NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)	Meanwhile, local science teacher Thomas Woodward is still being treated by Air Force medical personnel after last night's train derailment. Woodward apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his pick-up truck, which was hit by the speeding train at approximately one AM. Eighty-two train cars were thrown from the tracks in the derailment, the largest such accident in Ohio's history. The condition of Woodward, who has taught at Lillian Middle School for the past six years, remains unknown.
M	JOE	... Looks like a disaster movie, doesn't it...?
M	CHARLES	... oh my God, Joe... that's AWESOME--
M	JOE	-- what?
M	CHARLES	We can use this -- we can film it --
M	JOE	-- you wanna go back?!
M	CHARLES JOE	Holy shit, that's mint. You're a total brain--! We gotta get the camera fixed and the film developed from last night-- I gotta go steal some more money from my mom!
M	CHARLES	If any of the footage from last night is usable, that means we need Alice to play the wife again.
M	JOE	Yeah, I thought she was good.
M	CHARLES	She was mint, but she's never gonna do it.
M	JOE	I think she will. There's no way. You heard what she said.
M	JOE	But that was before the new pages, right?
M	CHARLES	You honestly think she cares about the scenes?
M	CHARLES	Man, did you hear what she said last night? "I never should have done this!" Dude, she was totally wigged!
M	JOE	Yes, she was, we all were.
M	CHARLES	Did you see her face?
M	JOE	Yeah, I saw her face.
M	CHARLES	Man, what's wrong with you?
M	JOE	Nothing. I think she's going to do it.
M	CHARLES	Lens is cracked. Focus ring broke. Ya think it's fixable?
M	DONNY	I think it's cheaper to buy a new one.
M	CHARLES	We're screwed, man, it's over! We can use my dad's camera -- it's got sound and-- Hello?
M	JOE	Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb.
M	ALICE (V.O.)	Hi...
M	JOE	So we have some new scenes. For the movie. We were hoping you'd be in `em. Oh-- no. No, I'm done with that.
M	JOE	Really? `Cause these are really good scenes.
M	CHARLES	We need this developed as soon as possible -- can you do overnight?
M	DONNY	Asshole, no one can do overnight. You wanna buy some pot?
M	CHARLES	... no, thank you.
M	DONNY	You guys are weak.
M	ALICE (V.O.)	I'm watching the crash on the news.
M	JOE	Yeah, I know, I saw it. Are you okay?
M	CHARLES	Well, what's the fastest you can do?
M	DONNY	I can make it a rush, you get the film back in three days-- what's your sister up to? The hot one, not the other one.
M	CHARLES	I don't know. I should go. -- wait, hold on -- lemme come over and show you the pages, okay? I'll be right there. No, d--
F	ALICE	I don't care what Charles wants-- I said no on the phone.
M	JOE	You totally did, that's true, I know, but--
F	ALICE	And now you're at my house.
M	JOE	I am, which-- under normal conditions I would nev--
F	ALICE	It's too weird after last night-- I don't understand how you guys can keep working on your stupid movie, I really don't.
M	JOE	We have to-- while the crash is still there. ... please...?
F	ALICE	No.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	You should go.
M	LOUIS	What's this?
F	ALICE	He was just inviting me to a party.
M	LOUIS	She's not going to your party.
M	JOE	Yessir.
M	LOUIS	You know better than this.
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	You get outta her. You go home and don't come back, I don't wanna see you.
M	ALIE	I'll do it.
M	JOE	-- what?
M	CHARLES	looked huge with the train! Wow! Joe: go reload the cap gun!
M	JOE	OKAY --
M	CHARLES	We'll get the other direction next - - Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go a little faster next time.
M	MARTIN	I'll try, but I'm still crying about last night, I feel like I'm crazy.
M	CARY	Did it really look good? My death?
F	ALICE	... what do you think happened...?
M	JOE	You mean why he crashed the train?
F	ALICE	I just got a horrible feeling.
M	MARTIN	Anyone else still shaking from the crash?
M	PRESTON	I got in my parents' bed last night. Haven't done that since I was eleven.
M	PRESTON (CONT'D)	... did I just insult him?
M	CHARLES	-- dude, what are you doing?
M	JOE	That whole thing's an Air Force train.
F	ALICE	-- what?
M	JOE	I make models-- plastic ones-- you know, glue `em, paint `em--
M	PRESTON	And he's not embarrassed by that.
M	CARY	Looks who's talking, Math Camp.
M	CHARLES	Thanks, could I have a coffee, please? Cream on the side?
M	WAITRESS	Sure.
M	CARY	He is so sophisticated.
M	CHARLES CARY	Shut up, I like coffee. No one likes coffee.
F	ALICE	Keep going.
M	JOE	Air Force trains -- even models -- have these hooks...
M	PRESTON	Ooo! Ooo ooo ooo! They do -- for when their train cars are put on transport ships.
M	JOE	Every car in that crash had hooks, every one...
M	CHARLES	Joe: stop talking about it.
M	MARTIN	Am I the only one who doesn't understand what this all means?
M	CARY	Probably, Smartin.
M	MARTIN	Shut up, I don't like that--
M	JOE PRESTON	Dr. Woodward had that map. He drove onto the tracks. Maybe there was something-- -- he wanted to destroy, he wanted to destroy? yeah.
M	CHARLES	Please shut up, all of you.
M	CARY	I say he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself.
M	JOE	He had a gun, why not use that?
M	PRESTON	There are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide: pills, HANGING--
M	CARY CHARLES	Pussy, stop pulling the fries away. I ordered these for a reason. -- he gets all possessive with his fries, it's so annoying. You could jump from a building.
M	MARTIN	Fall down stairs.
M	PRESTON	Well, that's not really effective. So, if it's Air Force, what would the Air Force have on a train?
M	CHARLES	SHHHHJESUS! You heard what the Old Man said, we can't talk about this! -- thank you, very much.
M	PRESTON	Drowning, hari kari, also known as seppuku--?
M	CARY	Excuse me, could we please get another order of fries because my friend here is fat?
M	CHARLES	Funny, Chompers, at least I don't use a booster seat.
M	MARTIN	What was your teacher even talking about? Who are we supposed to be afraid of anyway?
M	CHARLES	I don't wanna find out -- guys, we gotta forget we were there. Joe, seriously... you really wanna take a chance that something could happen to your dad, too?
M	NELEC	Yes, I understand, this crash has caused a whole mess of confusion.
M	JACK	As you can expect, the local authorities are trying to figure out just what happened here as well as how to help you out.
M	NELEC	It's under control. It'll be a very fast clean-up.
M	JACK	Colonel, there isn't anything I should know, is there?
M	NELEC	Not that I can think of, Deputy. I understand you have concerns about our cargo. I'd like to see that manifest, yes.
M	NELEC	That's not going to be possible.
M	JACK	Colonel, I've got a lot of people in my town that are gonna want to know what's taking place.
M	NELEC	-- what town is that?
M	JACK	... Lillian.
M	NELEC	Deputy, if you're asking me if we had any dangerous property on board this train, I can assure you the answer's no.
M	OVERMYER	Colonel.
M	NELEC	Excuse me.
M	JACK	They gave me the run around for two hours before I was allowed to talk to anyone.
M	PRUITT	I'd say they have their hands full, wouldn't you?
M	JACK	Nelec -- the Colonel -- refused to show me their manifest, said they were carrying mostly airplane parts-
M	PRUITT	It's Air Force, Jack. Airplane parts sorta make sense.
M	JACK	Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's something else going on -- they're taking molds of tire tracks -- now why would they be doing that? Who are they looking for? And they're packing these weird little cubes into crates and they're--
M	PRUITT	Weird little cubes?
M	JACK	--yeah, into these red trucks, dozens of these trucks -- and I'm telling you, they're scrambling to get the hell outta there--
M	PRUITT	I'd say that's a good thing, wouldn't you?
M	JACK	Sheriff, I think you need to go check it out.
M	PRESTON	And I think you need a break. Jack, I've been telling you this since Elizabeth. You're a good deputy. But you need to take a vacation. Go home. Take off your uniform. Go fishing. And give your son a hug.
M	SHERIFF PRUITT	Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's paying you to listen to the radio.
M	SHERIFF PRUITT (CONT'D)	Breen.
M	BREEN	Hey, Sheriff.
M	SHERIFF PRUITT	What's that?
M	BREEN	Walkman. It's like a stereo, play your own cassette tapes. You wanna try it?
M	SHERIFF PRUITT	I don't think so. Kids walking around with their own stereos. Just what we need. It's a slippery slope.
M	BREEN	... yessir.
F	ALICE	Where'd you learn how to do this?
M	JOE	Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook.
M	CHARLES	Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots of the train crash, obviously-- you know that train model you made? Can we blow it up and film it?
M	JOE	... sure.
M	CHARLES CARY	Mint. Gnarly! I don't care, they can blow it up. I can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid. You wanna see it? Later? The... train? My train model? The train I made?
M	CHARLES MARTIN	That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen. that's happened.
F	ALICE	So how am I supposed to be a zombie?
M	JOE	Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul. Someone with no soul, dead eyes. Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
F	ALICE	For English? Yeah--
M	JOE	-- like her. But hungry, like hungry for human flesh. To make them turn into zombies, because that's what zombies do.
M	JOE (CONT'D)	Oh my God. That's really good...
M	JOE (CONT'D)	... not bad.
F	EDIE	-- Careful, there was a gas spill. I don't even know how much fuel I've lost.
M	MR. BLAKELY	-- You don't seem to be asking a lot of questions.
F	EDIE	-- Give this man some time, Mr. Blakely.
M	MR. BLAKELY	He's just the Deputy, he's not the Sheriff...
M	MR. BLAKELY (CONT'D)	I think this is most likely a bear attack.
F	EDIE	Remember when I said you talk too much? Well, this is the time.
M	JACK	Vicky, ya heard from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?
M	VOICE (V.O.)	Negative, still no word.
M	JACK	Vicky, I need you to have Dayton send a CS unit out to Edie's. You put out an APB on the Sheriff and Breen Haskell -- send units to their houses immediately. You copy all of that?
M	VOICE (V.O.)	... copy. And Jack, we're getting a lot of unusual calls.
M	JACK	... what kind of unusual calls...?
M	IZZY	Never seen this kinda thing before. What the hell am I supposed to do? Insurance company thought I was joking with him. Look at my Bonneville here-- look at this. I got a call about this car yesterday. What am I going to tell the customer?
M	JACK	Having trouble with anyone lately, Izzy?
M	IZZY	I was thinking, you should talk to Louis Dainard. I didn't help him out with financing last year, wouldn't be surprised if this was-- some sorta sick retribution.
M	RESIDENTS JACK	-- Some strange shit has been -- d'you call the station our dog is gone, he hasn't station. And file a report, Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can Jack. you do that for me, I promise you, I'll handle it myself.
M	JOE	Lucy. Lucy. Lucy!
M	JOE	Lucy! ... Lucy!
M	OFFICER MIKE	We need more help around here.
M	OFFICER GORDON	We've got four men on the Pruitt case alone. We've called into Dayton, they'll be out in the MORNING----
M	JACK	That's not enough. People don't feel safe here -- and you know why? `Cause they're not-- -- the Air Force isn't answering a damn question: they've got trucks at Woodward's house, looking for SOMETHING --
M	OFFICER	They've got trucks all over town.
M	OFFICER JAY	I saw a guy riding shotgun in one of those trucks -- had some kind of scanner in his hand --
M	DEPUTY TALLY	--like a Geiger counter or SOMETHING--
M	JACK	I know. They're saying it's just clean-up at the train crash, but they're taking molds of tire tracks. Which means they're looking for someone-- now what's that about?
M	JOE	-- have you... seen Lucy?
M	JACK	I'm sure she's around. I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there.
M	DEPUTY TALLY	-- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid--
M	JOE	That's... okay, I'll find a--
M	JACK	Vicky, you got power at the station? On and off. Brook County's in the dark.
M	JACK	Get water and power out there now.
M	JOE	So the Air Force is looking for a car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're taking tire prints from the crash site. Over.
M	CHARLES	I don't wanna hear about it. They could be monitoring us right now! Jesus, shut up. Over!
M	JOE	And the military's at Woodward's house. Looking for his research. Whatever that means?
M	CHARLES	Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come help me tomorrow or not? I need you to make Alice a zombie again.
M	JOE	Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over.
M	ROONEY	This is Rooney at Mary-10, was there re-routing on this line?
M	VOICE (V.O.)	Negative, but the grid through Liberty is dark.
M	ROONEY	... yeah, `cause there's no overhead lines on these poles. -- come again?
M	ROONEY	No power, no comm cables. Stand by.
M	ROONEY	We got over a half mile of copper missing.
M	VOICE (V.O.)	-- that-- doesn't sound possible.
M	ROONEY	Lines are back up at M-38.
M	MRS. BABBIT (V.O.)	I wanna know who took `em.
M	MRS. BABBIT	Twenty microwave ovens: gone from my inventory. Brook County's without power -- this feels to me like a Russian invasion.
M	JACK	Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the Russians have anything to do with what's happening in town-- but I'm calling the curfew because w--
M	MRS. BABBIT	Until you can tell me who's messing with us, I say it's the Soviets and we're at war. I like you, Jack, but we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
M	JACK	We have good people working on that. Mr. McCandless.
M	MR. MCCANDLESS	Since Wednesday morning, my Ham radio's been a mess -- all sorts of frequencies I like to scan. Some kind of buzz modulation-- have you found that?
M	JACK	Mr. McCandless, can I speak with you for a moment, privately?
M	MR. MCCANDLESS JACK	-- it was like having my -- that must be very annoying- radio hi-jacked-- - you don't know the frequencies off-hand, do you?
M	WOMAN	Jack, all the tools in the garage are gone.
M	JACK	Patty, get in touch with Vicky. David, have you seen Milner?
M	DAVID	No, sir, I haven't seen him.
M	MAN	There's a sink hole in my garage. It almost sank a foot.
M	JACK	Hey Tom. Tom, have you seen Milner?
M	TOM	Have you tried his office?
M	JACK	Check his office.
M	MAN	The powers been out for days
M	JACK	--Rosko, I need you to get every radio we have and you tune to these frequencies -- understand?
M	ROSKO	No. What?
M	JACK	Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner with a descrambler don't you?
M	DANNY	Voice inverter, yeah.
M	JACK	Whatever, get it down and set it up for me.
M	ROSKO	What is this?
M	JACK	I think the Air Force is using UNASSIGNED CHANNELS--
M	LOUIS	Hey -- he was at my house yesterday morning, are you aware of that?
M	OFFICER ROSKO	We brought him in about the car lot and other things -- he's clean.
M	LOUIS	I'd appreciate it if you would inform your son that my house if off-limits. And so it my daughter.
M	JOE	Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.
F	ALICE	-- you made all these?
M	JOE	Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV. HERE---
M	JOE (CONT'D)	This is the train they wanna destroy.
F	ALICE	... it looks real. It looks so old...
M	JOE	That's dry brush technique. After you've painted the base color, you take something like... Euro Gray.
F	ALICE	Euro Gray...
M	JOE	There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off.
F	ALICE	What was that necklace? The one you were holding at the train crash. Was it your mom's?
M	JOE	My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to. It was bad, how she-- died and stuff, but they got the necklace back. So.
M	CHARLES	Guys, what the hell?! No one knew where you were.
M	JOE	We're sitting right here.
M	CHARLES	You gotta be the soldier.
M	JOE	I thought you were calling Evan.
M	CHARLES	Evan blew us off, he's a pussy. Excuse me.
F	ALICE	It's okay.
M	CHARLES	You gotta do it. You're the only one.
M	JACK	The hell do you mean you "found my dog in Brookville?" That's a DIFFERENT COUNTY--
M	OFFICER TALLY	Lucy-- that's where she is. We've gotten nearly thirty calls from people who have found local dogs. Thing is, the calls coming in aren't local.
M	OFFICER TALLY (CONT'D)	It's like they all just... ran away, every direction...
M	YOUNG WOMAN	It's not her. She never's disappeared before.
M	OFFICER ROSKO	Alright. Now what does she look like?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	She's got dark hair, it was in rollers. Do you know what rollers are?
M	OFFICER ROSKO	Yes, I know what rollers are.
M	YOUNG WOMAN	She went to her car--
M	OFFICER ROSKO	EXCUSE ME--
M	MALE VOICE (V.O.) OFFICERS	ocal position-- fangs out. Listen, that's Air Force. Walking Distance is-- six- transmitting on these three-niner, retur-- frequencies? Maybe they don't erations. want anyone to find em? Maybe they're not Air Force.
M	ROSKO	What's he say? Operation what?
M	JACK	Walking Distance.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	I came as soon as I could, what's happening here?
M	OFFICER JOE	Military police investigation. It was a suicide.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	Suicide? Who was it?
M	OFFICER JOE	A former Air Force officer. He called me last night, said he had a secret that he couldn't keep any longer.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	What's this?
M	OFFICER JOE	He worked at Romero Chemical. He found out some things the company's been doing. After what you told me at the bar, I thought you should know.
M	CARY	Are we gonna get in trouble here--?
M	CHARLES	Shhhh! Production value! It's for the movie!
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	This proves it. They knew, the company knew. Thank you so much for the information.
M	OFFICER JOE	We just made the discovery ourselves. You understand this is top secret.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	Of course.
M	OFFICER JOE	I would never have given you this information if you and I hadn't served together in Vietnam.
M	OVERMYER	Nothing so far--
M	NELEC	How much more is there?
M	OVERMYER	Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe more.
M	NELEC	What, more tax returns?
M	OVERMYER	It's here somewhere. If we can't find it, Woodward'll tell us where it is.
M	NELEC	... the hell's that?
M	OVERMYER	... looks like kids making a movie...
M	CHARLES	Joe. Hey, Mr. Lamb!
M	JACK	Get in the car.
M	CHARLES	Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera, but technically, that's my film--
M	NELEC	I would like to help you out deputy. I really would. But we operate on a need to know basis.
M	JACK	Why are your trucks sweeping the town?
M	NELEC	We'll be out of your way shortly.
M	JACK	Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me contacting DC. Talk to some friends about "Walking Distance."
M	JACK (CONT'D)	All right. We'll do it that way.
M	NELEC	Deputy. Let's talk. Just not here.
M	JACK	This is new. All this. For the both of us. Dealing with-- all this, just us. So I'm going to make this as clear and simple as I can: You're not friends with Alice Dainard. When I say no, I don't mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I mean no. I've known Louis Dainard for alotta years-- he's been nothing but trouble. Your mother used to say he's not a bad guy, he just needs a chance, he's just sad - - well I tried to be good to him, but I can't. Not anymore. I will not allow him or his daughter in this house. I will not allow you spending time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope we're clear.
M	JOE	We're not clear.
M	JACK	What'd you say?
M	JOE	We're not clear. You and I aren't clear about anything. We couldn't be less clear.
M	JACK	Joseph Francis Lamb--
M	JOE	Just `cause mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me!!! You don't. You don't know about Alice either -- she's kind!
M	JACK	I'm not having this discussion with you--!
M	JOE	She's NICE to me!
M	JACK	I don't care what she is! Her father is a selfish, irresponsible son-of-a-bitch!
M	JACK (CONT'D)	You listen to me, I've got twelve thousand people in this town that are scared out of their minds-- they've got one person they can rely on -- it used to be someone else, but now it's just me.
M	JACK	Hello--?
M	VOICE (V.O.)	Drop your weapons. Put your hands on the car.
M	JACK	--I'm here to see Colonel Nelec. He told me to meet him here.
M	VOICE (V.O.)	You're under military arrest. Drop your weapons.
M	JACK	WHERE'S NELEC?
M	NELEC	I don't want any more trouble. Do you?
M	NELEC (CONT'D)	We've been going through your belongings, looking for evidence. Of what you knew, how you knew it... and who else might know. I remember you. In the lab. And I recall we didn't see eye to eye, but that's no excuse for doing what you did here.
M	NELEC (CONT'D)	So in the spirit of moving forward and avoiding more trouble, tell us where you put your research. I know you had someone document the crash that night. Tell me who that was and I'll help you, I swear to God. On my mother's life -- if you help us now, we will take care of you.
M	DR. WOODWARD	I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec, when you take care of people.
M	NELEC	--I'm going to bait him. I'm going to catch him.
M	DR. WOODWARD	He's in me, you know. As I am in him. So when you see him next, as I'm sure you will... I'll be watching you, too.
M	ALIE	-- are you-- were you sleeping?
M	JOE	Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?
F	ALICE	Yeah.
M	JOE	Oh, you wanna come in?
F	ALICE	Power's still out.
M	JOE	Room's still messy.
F	ALICE	I was in bed, couldn't sleep. Thinking. I wanted to tell you something, before tomorrow -- Don't let Charles blow up your train.
M	ALICE (CONT'D)	I don't think it's right, do you? I know he's your friend, but he's so BOSSY--
M	JOE	He can be sorta li-- I've known him since Kindergarten, though--
F	ALICE	He shouldn't always get what he wants. I mean, who always gets what they want? -- I know I don't know you at all. Even though... it sort of feels like I do. Do you not... feel like that?
M	JOE	-- no, I totally do, I'm just... sort of in shock at this whole CONVERSATION--
F	ALICE	-- no, keep it-- please -- ... is that her?
M	JOE	... yeah...
M	JOE (CONT'D)	... it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here... ... she used to look at me, this way... like really look. And I just... knew I was there. That I existed.
F	ALICE	He drank that morning. My dad. He missed his shift. Your mom took it for him. The day of the accident. ... I know he wishes it was him. Instead of her. ... and sometimes I wish it was, too.
M	JOE	Don't say that. He's your dad.
M	ALICE JOE	-- has this--? -- no.
M	LOUIS (O.S.)	Morning.
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	You wanna tell me where you were? Or you want me to tell you.
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	Sit down.
F	ALICE	I should go to bed.
M	LOUIS	I wanna talk to you. I said sit down.
F	ALICE	I don't want to sit down.
M	LOUIS	Then go. Be just like your mother and leave.
M	LOUIS (CONT'D)	GO AHEAD, GO!
M	LOUIS	ALICE!!! WAIT!!!
M	LOUIS	ALICE!!! I'M SORRY!!!
M	LOUIS	-- ALICE, NO!!!!! NO!!!!!!!
M	LOUIS	
M	VOICE	Firelight is 0500 hours. Operation Walking Distance is in effect. T- minus four hours until evacuation. Evacuation is T-minus four hours.
M	JOE (V.O.)	Why are you not reacting?
M	JOE	That thing went through my wall.
M	CHARLES	I told you not to pick it up in the first place.
M	JOE	What are you so angry about? That I'm not going to let you blow up my train?
M	CHARLES	That's part of it! Juts a part!
M	DONNY	Tall your sister Donny from Olsen's broke up with Karen, that shit ended a week ago.
M	JOE	What's your problem?
M	CHARLES	My whole movie's a disaster `cause of you!
M	JOE	I know, my dad's being a turkey.
M	CHARLES	Whatever.
M	JOE	We're still gonna finish your movie!
M	CHARLES	It's not about the movie.
M	JOE	What are you talking about? Of course it is.
M	CHARLES	Just forget it.
M	JOE	Why?
M	CHARLES	There's nothing wrong--
M	JOE	I'll get the camera back, I know where my dad put it -- We can still make the festival.
M	CHARLES	It's not about the movie.
M	JOE	Then what is it about?
M	CHARLES	Jesus, you don't even get it do you? It's obvious.
M	JOE	What's obvious?
M	CHARLES	Gawd, you're a dumb ass.
M	CHARLES	That night of the crash, you started getting all weird.
M	JOE	-- what?
M	CHARLES	Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
M	JOE	Your movie was over! That's what you said! You were upset. I gave you a camera! I helped you!
M	CHARLES	Don't pretend like you did it for me! You didn't do it for me and you know it!
M	JOE	What's your problem?
M	CHARLES	It was never about me! It was always about Alice!
M	MRS. HATHAWAY	John. I don't like it. This case. These murders.
M	DETECTIVE HATHAWAY	What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you?
M	JOE	Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie!
M	CHARLES	Not so you could fall in love with her!
M	JOE	What do you even care what I think about Alice?!
M	CHARLES	Because I like her! That's why! That's why I asked her in the first place! So I could get to know her, not YOU!
M	JOE	-- wait, you like Alice Dainard?
M	CHARLES	You're such an idiot.
M	JOE	Guys, look out!
M	CHARLES	SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We can't use any of this. And you won't even let me blow up your train. Everything's bogus.
M	JOE	We can make another train and blow that one up.
M	JOE (CONT'D)	I do like her. Sorry about that.
M	CJAR	Shut up. It's okay. That's not even what bothers me. It's that she likes you too. That really bothers me. I dunno...
M	JOE	... Charles...
M	CHARLES	I know it's stupid. What would she ever like me? I haven't leaned out yet, which the doctor says is gonna HAP--
M	CHARLES (CONT'D)	-- Joe, what the hell--?!
M	JOE	Mr. Harkin. What's going on?
M	MR. HARKIN	Evacuation! The fire! -- Due to a wildfire that is raging out of control and threatening to reach the Lillian Chemical Plant--
M	PA VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	-- an evacuation has been called for your safety. Please remain calm and as you board the bus...
M	JOE CHARLES	You see your family anywhere? -- no, you see your dad?
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Charles, Charles -- sweetheart, are you okay? I went back to the house and you were gone.
M	CHARLES	They made us get on the bus.
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Hi, Joe.
M	JOE	Hi. I'm gonna find my dad.
M	CHARLES	You gonna tell him about that thing?
M	JOE	Yeah.
M	CHARLES' MOTHER	Come back if you can't find him.
M	ARGUING MAN ARGUING SOLDIER	-- I need to go back to my -- sir, the town is sealed -- no, we can't get it here -- the town must stay anywhere else, I need to go empty until we've been given
M	JOE	Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb. I know you don't like me sir, and I'm sorry about that-- but I'm looking for my dad--
M	LOUIS	It took her.
M	JOE	... what?
M	LOUIS	It took her. I saw it. It was... something... so... big, like nothing -- it was-- and no one... no one believes me... ... no one believes me-- they just keep giving me pills. It took her... Joe, it took Alice... no one believes me.
M	JOE	... I believe you.
M	JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	It took Alice.
M	CHARLES CARY	That thing took her--?! -- are you shitting me?
M	JOE (CONT'D)	Guys, WE HAVE TO GO BACK.
M	CHARLES PRESTON	Back where? To do what? Back to town -- to find Alice -- we have to find her--
M	MARTIN JOE	She's dead, if it took her, she-- -- don't say that!
M	PRESTON	Wait a minute -- first of all, I want to live. Okay?
M	JOE	I'm going whether you come or not-- which I really hope you do.
M	CARY	I've got six tons of explosives in here, let's find that thing and blow it to shit.
F	JEN	As if I'm gonna help you.
M	CHARLES	Do this for me and I'll babysit the twins next week so you can go to Wendy's stupid party.
M	CHARLES (CONT'D)	I am not shitting you. You can't ask me any questions though. You can't tell anyone. I'm serious. No one.
F	JEN	... does it have to be him?
M	CHARLES	Yes or no, you ugly freak. I'm about to rescind the offer.
F	JEN	This whole evacuation thing's freaking me out. Making me rethink my priorities. Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back.
M	DONNY	-- we totally could.
F	JEN	I asked Charles about you, and he said you're a great guy--
M	DONNY	I totally am.
F	JEN	Will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favor?
M	DONNY	So there are rules to being in my car, okay?
M	CARY	Where the hell are we going anyway?
M	JOE	We're going to the school to open the trailer Woodward had in the parking lot. I bet that's where he keeps his research.
M	CARY	What research?
M	JOE	We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing so we can find it. And that's how we're gonna save Alice.
M	DONNY	Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery and no one touches the CB, gottit?
M	CHARLES	You think Woodward's got information about that thing in the dungeon?
M	JOE	Why else are there padlocks on the door? We're going to the school.
M	DONNY	When did this one get so bossy?
M	JACK	Hey! I gotta take a leak! What am I supposed to do, piss in here?!
M	JACK (CONT'D)	Thanks for the hospitality.
M	JACK	So am I going in alone or are y--?
M	MARTIN	Well, so guys, if the Air Force has already searches Woodward's house, wouldn't they've already searched the classroom too?
M	CARY	Hay Donny, this car is gnarly.
M	CHARLES	I was thinking about that too.
M	JOE	Maybe the classroom, but not the dungeon.
M	CHARLES	Yeah, Woodward has all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon.
M	MARTIN	Where's the dungeon?
M	DONNY	Shut up. What kind of music does she like? Your sister.
M	CHARLES	I don't care. Disco I guess?
M	DONNY	I could get back into disco.
M	JOE	We shouldn't take River Road, they had a roadblock.
M	DONNY	Dork. I saw it. Observe.
M	DONNY	So what, I wait here like a douche?
M	JOE	Yes. Thank you very much. Do you have a tire iron?
M	CHARLES	Joe, let me try -- let me try.
M	CHARLES (CONT'D)	Joe, this is impossible, man.
M	CHARLES (CONT'D)	--I loosened it for you.
M	JOE	GUYS--
M	MARTIN CHARLES	Look at all this junk. He's got movies in here.
M	CHARLES	I cannot believe we're breaking into school, who does that? No one does that-- idiots do that--
M	JOE	Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellis Air Base in 1963 because of "subversive conduct," whatever that is.
M	MARIN	Dude, check it out. Old Man Woodward.
M	CHARLES	Back when he was like Middle-Aged Man Woodward.
M	MARTIN	-- He's been tracking this thing since like 1958.
M	JOE	What is this?
M	CHARLES	I don't know. It says April 8th, 1963 incident. I dunno.
M	JOE	Cary, we got to find this thing.
M	CARY	Sorry.
M	DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) JOE	-- I told them this creature is more sophisticated than any of us. That his species -- that's him -- IS PREDOMINANTLY subterranean. He's being -- subterranean -- treated without compassion or respect....
M	DR. WOODWARD (V.O.)	-- I explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship. A craft made up of those cubes of a complex, shape-shifting element-- remarkable material that we'll never fully understand. He has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in `58, but instead of giving him the help he needs, we've held him as a prisoner. He's been restrained and experimented upon -- Through pain and lack of compassion, we have taught him to hate us all. We've turned him into an enemy.
M	CARY	Guys, it's Dr. Woodward. Look.
M	CHARLES MARTIN	Arh! I can't watch that!
M	DR. WOODWARD (V.O.)	I told them I knew these things because he made contact with me. That he makes a psychic connection by touch. The moment we made contact, I understood him and he, me. What I know is that if we don't change this and start helping him, we will all pay the price. But Nelec won't listen--
M	JOE	Woodward wasn't trying to kill it.
M	CHARLES	He was trying to help it escape.
M	MARTIN	Did you hear that?
M	CHARLES COMMANDO	
M	CHARLES	-- oh shit!
M	NELEC	Search them.
M	CARY	I rolled those M-80's myself, that's right.
M	NELEC	You're the Deputy's boy.
M	JOE	-- hey, no-- Move out.
M	DONNY	... oh shit...
M	DONNY (CONT'D)	Breaker breaker, requesting police backup, over?! Breaker breaker, is this the police channel?
M	SOLDIER	Staff Sergeant.
M	JACK	Hi, how are you doing?
M	YOUNG KID	Hi, Mr. Lamb.
M	JACK	Shhhh. Rosko!
M	OFFICER ROSKO	Where the hell you been? What are YOU WEARING--
