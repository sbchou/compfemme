M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MR. BOBINSKY	Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri ... Mer-sa-vich! We're here. Time to muscle up. Got it? Almost there, just a few more. Come on, now, LIFT.
F	CORALINE	Hello?... Who's there?
F	CORALINE	You scared me to death, you mangy thing!
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	I'm just looking for an old well. Know it? Not talking, huh? Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	WYBIE Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or Utah; someplace dried out and barren, right? I heard about water-witching before but it doesn't make sense; I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.
M	WYBIE	Ow!
F	CORALINE	And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by
M	WYBIE	He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral 足 you know, wild? Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead things. Look, I'm from Pontiac.
M	WYBIE	Huh?
F	CORALINE	MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch",
M	THEN--	--where's the secret WELL?
M	WYBIE	You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it! See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day. CORALINE Huh.
M	WYBIE	Surprised she let you move in... ... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace" Won't rent to people with kids.
F	CORALINE	What do you mean?
M	WYBIE	Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.
M	WYBIE (CONT'D)	I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat. Wybie?
M	WYBIE	Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of course. What'd you get saddled with?
F	CORALINE	I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline.
M	WYBIE	Caroline what?
F	CORALINE	Coraline. Coraline Jones.
M	WYBIE	Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name, like Caroline -- -- can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person--
M	WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)	Wyborne!
F	CORALINE	I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne.
M	WYBIE	What? I didn't hear anything--
F	CORALINE	Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were- you-born. Wyborne!
M	WYBIE	Grandma!
M	WYBIE (CONT'D)	Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch. But I'd wear gloves next time. Why?
M	WYBIE (CONT'D)	`Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh, it's poison oak.
F	CORALINE	Ehh!! Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her
F	CORALINE	I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
F	MEL	Uh huh.
F	CORALINE	I would have died.
F	MEL	That's nice.
F	CORALINE	Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening.
F	MEL	No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
F	CORALINE	But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here?
F	MEL	Something like that. But then we had the accident.
F	CORALINE	Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
F	MEL	I never said it was. CORALINE I can't believe it -- you and Dad get paid to write about plants and you hate dirt.
F	MEL	Coraline, I don't have time for you right now. And you still have unpacking to do. Lots of unpacking.
F	CORALINE	That sounds exciting. Oh - some kid left this on the front porch. Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.
F	CORALINE	Huh... a little me? That's weird.
F	MEL	What's his name, anyway?
F	CORALINE	Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.
F	CORALINE	Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?
M	CHARLIE	Hello, Coraline... And... Coraline doll?...
F	CORALINE	D'you know where the garden tools are?
M	CHARLIE	It's pouring out there, isn't it.
F	CORALINE	Humph, it's just raining.
M	CHARLIE	What'd the boss say? "Don't even think about going out, Coraline Jones." Then you won't need the tools. Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred and fifty years old.
F	CORALINE	So?
M	CHARLIE	So explore it! Go out and ... count all the doors and windows and write that down. List everything blue! Just let me work. PARENT'S ROOM/BATHROOM
F	CORALINE	Ewww! Ahh!! She shakes out her hair.
M	CHARLIE	No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!
F	CORALINE	One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors... All right, little me, where are you hiding?
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Huh?
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Hey Mom...
M	CORALINE (O.S.)	Where does this door go?
F	MEL	I'm really, really busy!
F	CORALINE	I think it's locked. Pleeeeeeeeease!
F	MEL	Uhhh...
F	MEL	Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you?
M	MEL (CONT'D)	Fine.
F	CORALINE	Bricks? I don't get it.
F	MEL	They must have closed this off when they divided up the house.
F	CORALINE	You're kidding? And why is the door so small?
F	MEL	We made a deal. ZIP IT!
F	CORALINE	You didn't lock it. AaaaaH!!! Oh, my twitchy witchy girl,
M	CHARLIE	I think you are so nice, I give you bowls of porridge And I give you bowls of ice --
M	CHARLIE	-- cream!
F	CORALINE	Why don't you ever cook, Mom?
F	MEL	Coraline, we've been through this before: your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out of the way. I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we finish the catalog. Try some of the chard, you need a vegetable.
F	CORALINE	Looks more like slime to me.
M	CHARLIE	Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot -- now what's it going to be?
F	CORALINE	Think they're trying to poison me?
F	CORALINE	Don't forget about me, guys. Okay? Good-night...little me.
F	CORALINE	Whoa...
F	CORALINE	Huh?
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	MMMMM, something smells good.
F	CORALINE	Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night?
M	OTHER MOTHER	You're just in time for supper, dear!
F	CORALINE	You're not my mother. My mother doesn't have b-b-buh... B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?
M	OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)	I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell your Other Father that supper's ready.
M	OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)	Well, go on. He's in his study.
F	CORALINE	Hello?
M	OTHER FATHER	Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new song?
F	CORALINE	My father can't play piano. No need to ... this piano plays ME!
M	OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)	Making up a song about Coraline. She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine. She's as cute as a button in the eyes of When she comes around exploring Mom and I will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on Coraline.
F	CORALINE	I, uh 足 sorry 足 but she said to tell you the food's ready.
M	OTHER FATHER	Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand.
M	OTHER FATHER	We give our thanks and ask to bless, Our Mother's golden chicken breast!
F	CORALINE	Mmmm, this chicken is good.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Hungry, aren't you.
F	CORALINE	D'you have any gravy? Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo-
M	OTHER MOTHER	Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the
F	CORALINE	I'm real thirsty.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Of course! Any requests?
F	CORALINE	Mango milk shake? Home?
M	OTHER MOTHER	We've been waiting for you, Coraline.
F	CORALINE	For me?
M	OTHER FATHER	Yep. Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.
F	CORALINE	I didn't know I had an Other Mother.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Of course you do. Everyone does.
F	CORALINE	Really?
M	OTHER MOTHER	Uh huh, and soon as you're through eating, I thought we'd play a game. You mean like, hide and seek?
M	OTHER MOTHER	Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain.
F	CORALINE	What rain? Huh, what about the mud?
M	OTHER FATHER	We love mud here!
M	OTHER MOTHER	Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's great for poison oak. CORALINE How'd you know I-- I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get home to my other mother.
M	OTHER MOTHER	But I'm your other mother. I mean my other other mother. Mom number one? I think I should get to bed.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up.
F	CORALINE	But ...
M	OTHER FATHER	Come along, sleepyhead.
F	CORALINE	Wow.
M	DRAGONFLIES	Hello Coraline, hello, hello!
M	TOY SQUID	What's shakin', baby?
F	CORALINE	Hello. Hey, how zit goin', yuper! Where's your swampers and tuke?
F	CORALINE	Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right?
M	PHOTO FRIEND 1	We're already here, Coraline --
F	CORALINE	Oh, the mud...
M	OTHER MOTHER OTHER FATHER	See you soon ... See you soon ... It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!... CORALINE Huh?
F	CORALINE	It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother. MEL Buttons for eyes, huh? Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at least.
F	CORALINE	You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers.
M	CHARLIE	Orange? My monkey slippers are blue. Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking about?
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Because I have a terrible case of writer's rash. On my---.
F	MEL	If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would love to hear your dream.
F	CORALINE	Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats. Uh huh.
F	CORALINE	Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Ohh, Poo-eeeee!

M	MR. BOBINSKY	New "cheese" samples.
M	MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)	Very clever, using this "mix up" to sneak my home and peek at meeshkas Meeshkas?
M	MR. BOBINSKY	The Mice!
F	CORALINE	Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones. And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you can call me Mr. B, because amazing I already know that I am.
M	MR. BOBINSKY	Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my new songs go oompah oompah. But the jumping mice play only toodle toot, like that. Is nice, but not so much amazing? So now-- --I switch to stronger cheese, and soon 足 Here, have beet. Make you strong. Daas vee DAAN ya, Caroline.
F	CORALINE	Cor-a-line.
F	CORALINE	Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot.
F	CORALINE	No!!! The mice...asked me to give you message.
F	CORALINE	The...jumping mice?
M	MR. BOBINSKY	They are saying: do not go through leetle door. Do you know such a thing?
F	CORALINE	The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up.
M	MR. BOBINSKY	Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the mice are leetle... ...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your name wrong, you know. They call you Coraline instead of Caroline, not Caroline at all.
M	MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)	Maybe I work them too hard... MISS SPINK Oh cease your infernal yapping! How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you like to come in? We're playing cards.
F	CORALINE	Still Coraline, Miss Spink.
F	MISS SPINK	Miriam, put the kettle on!
M	MISS FORCIBLE	April, I think you're being followed.
F	MISS SPINK	It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline? She'll be having the Oolong tea.
M	MISS FORCIBLE	No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer Jasmine.
F	MISS SPINK	No, Oolong. Ah, Jasmine it is, then.
F	MISS SPINK	Come on, boys! Are those dogs .... real? Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear to part with them ... so we had them stuffed. Now, there's Hamish the third, the fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the second, the fifth, the..
M	MISS FORCIBLE	Oh go on, have one 足 it's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton 足 best in the world. ...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes, the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior, Jock senior, Jock the third, the fourth...
M	MISS SPINK (CONT'D)	...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin, twice removed. I'll read them, if you like.
F	CORALINE	Read what?
F	MISS SPINK	Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell me your future. Drink up then, go on.
M	MISS SPINK (CONT'D)	No, not all of it, not all of it. That's right, now hand it over. Oh... Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you are in terrible danger.
M	MISS FORCIBLE	Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes are going.
F	MISS SPINK	My eyes! You're blind as a bat! Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child, it's good news: there's a tall, handsome beast in your future.
F	CORALINE	A what?
F	MISS SPINK	Miriam, oh really, you're holding it wrong. See? Danger! What do you see? I see a very peculiar hand...
M	MISS FORCIBLE	I see a giraffe.
F	MISS SPINK	Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam.
M	MISS SPINK (CONT'D)	Oh!
M	MISS FORCIBLE	Oh, lord!
F	CORALINE	Well, what should I do?
F	MISS SPINK	Never wear green in your dressing room.
M	MISS FORCIBLE	Acquire a very tall step ladder.
F	MISS SPINK	And be very, very careful. Now, was there something you came to tell us?
F	CORALINE	No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though.
M	MISS FORCIBLE	Toodle-oo.
F	MISS SPINK	Cheery-bye. Do you have any nice Queens for mummy?
F	CORALINE	Danger?
M	WYBIE	Owwwwwwww!
F	CORALINE	Great, the village stalker.
M	WYBIE	Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're hunting banana slugs.
F	CORALINE	What d'ya mean, "we?" Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss! What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez. Wuss-puss... So... that doll. Did you make it look like me?
M	WYBIE	Oh no; I found it that way. It's older than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly.
F	CORALINE	C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?
M	WYBIE	Dang, check out Slugzilla! You're just like them.
M	WYBIE	Huh? He looks from the slug to himself.
F	CORALINE	I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either.
M	WYBIE	Uh huh... You mind?
F	CORALINE	Ew!
M	WYBIE	You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace. CORALINE You're kidding.
M	WYBIE	Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's dangerous or something.
F	CORALINE	Dangerous?
M	WYBIE	Well... she had a twin sister.
F	CORALINE	So?
M	WYBIE (O.C.).	When they were kids, Grandma's sister disappeared. She says she was stolen. Stolen? Well, what do you think?
M	WYBIE	Uhhh, I-I don't know. Maybe she just ran away? Wyborne!
M	WYBIE	Look, I gotta go.
F	CORALINE	Wait a minute!
M	OTHER MOTHER	Welcome back, darling.
F	CORALINE	Hi.
M	OTHER MOTHER	So thoughtful of you to send this nice cheddar, Coraline.
F	CORALINE	Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait...
M	OTHER MOTHER	Would you go fetch your father? Bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now!
F	CORALINE	You mean my Other Father?
M	OTHER MOTHER	Your better father, dear. He's out in the garden.
M	CORALINE.	But my parents don't have time to garden.
F	CORALINE	Mmmmmm!
M	OTHER MOTHER	Go on...
M	OTHER FATHER	Hey!!!
F	CORALINE	I love your garden!
M	OTHER FATHER	Our garden, Coraline! Oh ah, stop! Stop tickling, ah!
M	OTHER FATHER	Oops, daughter in distress!
M	OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)	Tickle no more, you dragon snappers!
F	CORALINE	Well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food?
M	OTHER FATHER	Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you something!
F	CORALINE	I can't believe you did this!
M	OTHER FATHER	Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows you like the back of her hand.
F	CORALINE	Mmmm...so good!
M	OTHER FATHER	I love dinner, breakfast food.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner.
F	CORALINE	Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong.
M	OTHER FATHER	Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs.
F	CORALINE	My friend?
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were-
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	OTHER MOTHER	I thought you'd like him more, if he spoke a little less. So I fixed him.
F	CORALINE	So he can't talk at all?
M	OTHER MOTHER	Nope.
F	CORALINE	Hmm, I like it. OTHER MOTHER Now run along, you two, and have fun.
F	CORALINE	You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything. Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she...
F	CORALINE	Whoa... cool!
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Look at you!
M	OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)	Lady and gentleman! For to tickle your eyes and ears and making hearts to thump, I 足 Sergei Alexander Bobinsky 足 am introducing... ... my as-tound-ishing, stu-pen-dulous and AH-MAZING Jumping Mouse Circus! My name! It's wonderful, Wybie! Wow!
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great!
M	OTHER MR. BOBINSKY	Very very thank you, lady and gentleman.
F	CORALINE	We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so--
F	CORALINE	A-mazing!
M	OTHER MR. BOBINSKY	You are very velcome anytime you like, you and also your good friend there.
M	OTHER MR. BOBINSKY(CONT'D)	Dosvedanya, Coraline.
F	CORALINE	Ughhh.
M	CORALINE (V.O.).	... there were garden squash like balloon Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse circus, not pretend like the crazy man's in our house.
M	CHARLIE	You sure you won't come?
F	MEL	Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new catalog. At least, they'll love my chapters.
M	MEL (CONT'D)	I did not call him crazy, Coraline. He's drunk.
M	CHARLIE	Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer.
F	CORALINE	Da-ad! I'm not five anymore.
M	YOUNG RASCAL	My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!
F	MEL	Put them back.
F	CORALINE	But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these.
F	MEL	Put them back.
F	CORALINE	My other mother would get them.
F	MEL	Maybe she should buy all your clothes.
F	CORALINE	So what do you think's in the other apartment?
F	MEL	I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters.
F	CORALINE	Then why'd you lock the door?
F	MEL	Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer.
F	CORALINE	They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here.
F	MEL	Your school might be fun.
F	CORALINE	With those stupid uniforms? Right.
F	MEL	Had to give it a try.
F	MEL	How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch?
F	CORALINE	Are you kidding me?
F	MEL	Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special.
F	CORALINE	Gross-gusting. You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like.
F	CORALINE	Oh, like the gloves?
F	MEL	Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up.
F	CORALINE	That's what you always say.
F	MEL	Won't be long. But I might be... I knew it was real! Dearest Coraline,
M	M	iss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited you downstairs after lunch. I hope you like the new outfit I made you! Love, Mother.
F	CORALINE	Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other Cat.
M	CAT	No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me.
F	CORALINE	Um... I can see you don't have button eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can you talk?
M	CAT	I just can.
F	CORALINE	Cats don't talk at home.
M	CAT	No?
F	CORALINE	Nope. CAT Well, you're clearly the expert on these things. After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss.
F	CORALINE	Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I called you that, I really am. How'd you get here?
M	CAT	I've been coming here for a while. It's a game we play. She... ...hates cats and tries to keep me out. I come and go as I please. The Other Mother hates cats? Not like any "mother" I've ever known.
F	CORALINE	What do you mean? She's amazing!
M	CAT	You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so.
F	CORALINE	That's nonsense. He can't talk.
M	CAT	Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and -- Shhhh! I hear something! Right ...over...
F	CORALINE	Hey, Wybie. She's practically naked!
M	OTHER MISS SPINK	I'm known as the siren of all seven seas The breaker of hearts by the bay. So, if you go swimmin' With bow-legged women, I might steal your weak heart away.
F	CORALINE	Oh my God.
M	OTHER MISS FORCIBLE	A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through the waves, And hope to lead sailors astray, But a true ocean goddess, Must fill out her bodice, To present an alluring display.
M	OTHER MISS SPINK	Beware of old oysters, too large in the chest, Let's banish them from the buffet.
M	OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)	I'm far more nutritious
M	OTHER MISS FORCIBLE	You smell like the fishes
M	OTHER MISS SPINK	Did I hear a banshee?
M	OTHER MISS FORCIBLE	You're sea-green with envy
M	OTHER MISS SPINK	This mermaid enchantress,
M	OTHER MISS FORCIBLE	No, I "Birth of Venus!" Will send sailors swooning --oh--!
M	OTHER MISS SPINK	Will send sailors swooning --oh--! I can't look!
M	OTHER MISS SPINK	Ready to break a leg, Miriam?
M	OTHER MISS FORCIBLE	Our lives for the theater, April!
M	YOUNG FORCIBLE	What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason!
M	YOUNG SPINK	How infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable!
M	YOUNG FORCIBLE	In action like an angel!
M	YOUNG SPINK	In apprehension how like a god!
F	CORALINE	Ahhh!!! The beauty of the world!
M	YOUNG SPINK	The paragon of animals!
F	CORALINE	Yeah!!
M	OTHER FATHER	Hey there.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Was it wonderful, dear?
F	CORALINE	Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat 足 Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic.
M	OTHER MOTHER	You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?
F	CORALINE	Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.
M	OTHER MOTHER	You could stay here forever... if you want to.
F	CORALINE	Really?
M	OTHER FATHER	Sure...we'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals.
M	OTHER MOTHER	There's one tiny little thing we need to do.
F	CORALINE	What's that?
M	OTHER FATHER	Well, it's a surprise. For you ... our little doll. Black is traditional, but if you'd prefer pink or vermillion or chartreuse... ... though you might make me jealous. Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to stay here. So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww!
M	OTHER MOTHER	There now; it's your decision, darling. We only want what's best for you. I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW! Bed?
M	OTHER FATHER	Before dinner?
F	CORALINE	I'm really, really tired. Yeah... I just need to sleep on things.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Well of course you do, darling... I'll be happy to tuck you in.
F	CORALINE	Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already--
M	OTHER MOTHER	You're welcome. And I 足 we aren't worried at all, darling. Soon you'll see things our way.
M	MAGIC DRAGONFLY	What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to play?
M	TOY SQUID	Yeah, I wanna hugga your face!
M	TOY TANK GIRAFFE	Get a grip, soldier.
M	PHOTO FRIENDS	Hey!
M	PHOTO FRIEND 1	Where's yer buttons, yuper?
M	PHOTO FRIEND 2	You wanna stay, don'tcha?
F	CORALINE	I'm going home tonight, robots - and I won't be back. Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! Go to sleep, go to sleep... There's just one tiny little thing we have to do.
F	CORALINE	Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... So sharp you won't feel a thing...
F	CORALINE	Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... Soon you'll see things our way...
F	CORALINE	Mom!... Dad!..
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Oh God, I'm still here?
F	CORALINE	Hey you! Where's the Other Mother? I want to go home.
M	OTHER FATHER	All will be swell, soon as Mother's refreshed. Her strength is our strength.
M	OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)	Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.
F	CORALINE	If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna find the Other Wybie. He'll help me.
M	OTHER FATHER	No point; he pulled a long face...
M	OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)	...and Mother didn't like it.
M	CAT	And what do you think you're doing?
F	CORALINE	Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing. Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the old well be here?
M	CAT	Nothing out here ... it's the empty part of this world. She only made what she knew would impress you.
F	CORALINE	But why? Why does she want me? She wants something to love, I think. Something that isn't her... Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.
F	CORALINE	Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters!
M	CAT	I don't know. How do you taste?
F	CORALINE	Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?
M	CAT	Walk around the world.
F	CORALINE	Small world.
M	CAT	Hang on--
F	CORALINE	Stop, he's one of the circus mice!
M	CAT	I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm.
F	CORALINE	Gooooood kitty.
M	OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)	They say even the proudest -- --spirit can be broken ... with love.
M	OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)	Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like one?
M	OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)	They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.
F	CORALINE	I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Is that any way to talk to your mother?
F	CORALINE	You aren't my mother.
M	OTHER MOTHER	Apologize at once, Coraline!
F	CORALINE	No. OTHER MOTHER I'll give you to the count of three. One...
M	OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)	...two...
F	CORALINE	Ow, what are you doing!
F	CORALINE	Ow, that hurts!
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	You may come out when you've learned to be a loving daughter! CORALINE Who's there? Hush! And shush! For the Beldam might be listening! You ... you mean the Other Mother? ...
M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Who are you? BOY GHOST Don't remember our names... But I `member my true mommy...
F	CORALINE	Why are you all here?
M	ALL GHOSTS	The Beldam!
M	SWEET GIRL GHOST	She spied on our lives, through the little doll's eyes,
M	BOY GHOST	And saw that we weren't happy.
M	TALL GIRL GHOST	So she lured us away,
M	TALL GIRL GHOST (CONT'D)	with treasures and treats, and games to play!
M	BOY GHOST	Gave all that we asked -
M	SWEET GIRL GHOST	yet we still wanted more -
M	TALL GIRL GHOST	So we let her sew the buttons.
M	BOY GHOST	She said that she loved us,
M	TALL GIRL GHOST	But she locked us here
M	ALL GHOSTS	And ate up our lives.
F	CORALINE	Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance.
M	SWEET GIRL GHOST	Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you could find our eyes?
F	CORALINE	Has she taken those, too?
M	SWEET GIRL GHOST	Yes, miss. And hidden them.
M	BOY GHOST	Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed.
F	CORALINE	I ... I'll try. Did she do this to you? I hope that feels bet--

M	WYBIE.	Well, i-it looked just like you. And I
F	CORALINE	It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and.... Grandma's missing sister! I think I just met her. C'mon!
M	WYBIE	Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed
F	CORALINE	She's in there.
M	WYBIE	C-can you 足 can you unlock it?
F	CORALINE	Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can. Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get that doll?
F	CORALINE	Great! I'd love to get rid of it!
F	CORALINE	Where are you hiding, you little monster?!
M	WYBIE	You and Gramma been talking?
F	CORALINE	The doll's her spy! It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life!
M	WYBIE	The doll...is my Gramma's...spy.
F	CORALINE	NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this whole world where everything's better - the food, the garden, the-- --neighbors. But it's all a trap!
M	WYBIE	Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone calling me, Jonesy.
F	CORALINE	Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat!
M	WYBIE	The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that you couldn't find the doll-- OW!
F	CORALINE	You're not LISTENING TO ME!
M	WYBIE	That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY!

F	CORALINE	Dad! Whe- I'm digging in my garden right now, but leave a message and I'll get right back to you.
F	CORALINE	Where have you gone?

F	MISS SPINK	Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late. April? Aren't you getting ready?
F	MISS SPINK	We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline says her parents have vanished, quite completely.

F	CORALINE	She's taken them.
F	CORALINE	They're not coming back, are they 足 Mom and Dad. Not on their own. Only one thing to do.
M	CAT	You know, you're walking right into her trap.
F	CORALINE	I have to go back. They are my parents.
M	CAT	Challenge her then. She may not play fair but she won't refuse. She's got a thing for games.
F	CORALINE	Hmmm, okay.
M	MOTHER	Coraline?
F	CORALINE	Mom?
M	MOTHER	Coraline, you came back for us!
M	MOTHER	Darling! Why would you run away from me?
F	CORALINE	Where are my parents?
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	Gosh, I have no idea where your "old" parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored of you and run away to France?
F	CORALINE	They weren't bored of me. You stole them!
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a seat, won't you? Why don't you have your own key?

M	CORALINE (CONT'D)	Why don't we play ... a game? I know you like them.
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	Everybody likes games. Uh huh.
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	What kind of game would it be? An exploring game ... a finding things game.
M	OTHER MOTHER	And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline?
F	CORALINE	My real parents. Too easy.
F	CORALINE	And, and the eyes of the ghost children.
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	Huh. What if you don't find them?
F	CORALINE	If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me. And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes.
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	Hmmm... And if you somehow win this game?
F	CORALINE	Then you let me go. You let everyone go 足 my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	Deal.
F	CORALINE	Not till you give me a clue.
M	TALL OTHER MOTHER	Oh, right... In each of three wonders I've made just for you, a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.
F	CORALINE	And for my parents? Fine. Don't tell me... ...it's a deal-- What does she mean "wonders?" Hmmm.

F	CORALINE	Ahhh! No!!
F	CORALINE	Noooo! Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost everything.
M	CAT	I think I mentioned that I don't like rats at the best of times.

M	BELDAM	No, I suppose not. After all, you still need to find your old parents, don't you? Too bad you won't have this.
M	SWEET GIRL GHOST (O.S.)	Be clever, miss; even if you win she'll never let you go!
F	CORALINE	I already know where you've hidden them.
M	BELDAM	Well... produce them.
F	CORALINE	They're behind that door.
M	BELDAM	Oh, they are, are they?
M	CAT	There! CORALINE Mom. Dad! Go on. Open it. They'll be there, all right.
