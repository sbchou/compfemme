M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	JAN	There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
F	HANA	I'm not sewing anything else.
F	JAN	You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
F	HANA	No!
F	JAN	Hana, I know you do!
F	HANA	I'm not sewing anything else for you!
F	JAN	I love you.
M	KIP	Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!
M	HARDY	Don't move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!
M	HARDY	Good, that's good, just stay still for me and then we're going to be fine.
M	HARDY	What are you doing?! What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
F	HANA	Do you need something?
F	MARY	Are you okay? Oh God, Hana, you were like sisters.
F	HANA	We keep moving him - in and out of the truck. Why? He's dying. What's the point?
F	MARY	Well, we can't hardly leave him. Do you mean leave him? We can't.
F	HANA	I must be a curse. Anybody who loves me, anybody who gets close to me - or I must be cursed. Which is it?
F	HANA	The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
M	OLIVER	It's not over everywhere. I didn't mean literally.
F	HANA	When he dies I'll catch up.
M	OLIVER	It's not safe here. The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what. It's madness. I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us. Hana -
F	HANA	I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.
M	OLIVER	And what if he really is a spy?
F	HANA	He can't even move.
M	OLIVER	If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
M	OLIVER	We're heading for Leghorn. Livorno the Italians call it. We'll expect you.
F	HANA	Up there.
M	THE PATIENT	There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince?
F	HANA	Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy!
F	HANA	In here.
F	HANA	Thank you.
F	HANA	Good.
M	D'AGOSTINO	Thirsty?
M	MADOX	What's this?
M	D'AGOSTINO	Don't drink it!
M	D'AGOSTINO	I can't guarantee the vintage, my friends. I just dug it out of the hill.
M	MADOX	Excellent. That's terrific, D'Ag. Toss that up, would you.
M	D'AGOSTINO	There are some others.
M	MADOX	My God, look at this!
M	BERMANN	Incredible, Hmm? Quite incredible.
M	D'AGOSTINO	I've never seen anything like it. There would have been enough water here to serve an army.
M	ALMÁSY	Which means we're in the wrong place.
M	D'AGOSTINO	Why? Would you stockpile water near to an Oasis? There can't be a natural spring within fifty miles of here.
M	FOUAD	Or they didn't know of one.
M	BERMANN	So, it may not be Zerzura, still incredible.
M	D'AGOSTINO	A pottery hill!
M	ALMÁSY	A wild goose chase.
M	MADOX	No.
M	MADOX	No. Now we look in the other places. We're eliminating.
M	MADOX	Good, and here comes reinforcements.
F	CLIFTON	I hereby Christen us the International Sand Club!
M	MADOX	Marvelous plane. Did you look?
F	CLIFTON	Isn't it? Wedding present from Katharine's parents. I'm calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
M	MADOX	We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap.
M	D'AGOSTINO	Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.
F	KATHARINE	Geoffrey gave me your monograph when I was reading up on the desert. Very impressive.
M	ALMÁSY	Thank you.
F	KATHARINE	I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
M	ALMÁSY	A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
F	CLIFTON	A broken car? Still a car.
M	CLIFFTON	Not much use, though.
F	KATHARINE	Love? Romantic love, platonic love, filial love - ? Quite different things, surely?
F	CLIFTON	Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife.
M	ALMÁSY	There you have me.
M	THE PATIENT	What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
F	HANA	I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful.
M	THE PATIENT	Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
F	HANA	I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
M	THE PATIENT	My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him.
F	HANA	Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard!
M	THE PATIENT	Thank you.
M	THE PATIENT	The plumness of this plum.
M	THE PATIENT	What's that?
F	HANA	Water! You hear it, too, don't you!
M	FOUAD	European, I think, with guides.
F	CLIFTON	How do you know?
M	MADOX	Yes, and I think I know who this is.
M	FENELON-BARNES	Ugly brute. Shits and roars and complains all day. Of course, you have your aeroplane. Two now! Do you still call yourselves explorers? I assume not.
M	MADOX	Fenelon-Barnes.
M	ALMÁSY	Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an explorer, can't he? Or should Columbus have swum to America?
M	MADOX	I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
F	CLIFTON	Apprentices.
M	MADOX	This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
M	FENELON-BARNES	I know your mother, of course.
F	KATHARINE	Hello.
M	FENELON-BARNES	I'm also searching for the lost Oasis, but by more authentic means.
M	MADOX	Anyway, my friend here has a new theory - that Zerzura doesn't exist. So we may all be chasing windmills. Have some food.
M	FENELON-BARNES	Well, it's certainly not between here and Dakhla. Nine days of nothing but sand and sandstorms. An egg. I found an ostrich egg and some fossils.
F	KATHARINE	Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
M	ALMÁSY	What kind of fossils?
M	FENELON-BARNES	I'll invite you to my paper at the Royal Geographical Society. Are you still a member?
M	ALMÁSY	I think you know I am.
M	FENELON-BARNES	Quite impossible, Madox. You must know that. If you attempt to cross the Sand Sea due east of Kufra by car you'll leave your bones in the sand for me to collect.
M	ALMÁSY	If you come across my bones - I hope you'll do me the honor of leaving them in peace. Excuse me.
M	FENELON-BARNES	You have my word as a gentleman. I've discovered a unique type of sand-dune. I've applied to the King for permission to call it The Fenelon-Barnes Formation.
F	KATHARINE	I can't sing. but I can tell a story. I might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I've noticed you carry it...
M	ALMÁSY	I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
M	MADOX	Your book. Your Herodotus!
F	KATHARINE	It doesn't matter. Really. I think I can muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
M	ALMÁSY	Daskylus...
F	KATHARINE	Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story?
F	HANA	I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules.
M	THE PATIENT	Candaules
F	HANA	Candaules...you're laughing at me.
M	THE PATIENT	I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please.
F	HANA	When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure...
F	KATHARINE	And that evening, it's exactly as the King had told him, she goes to the chair and removes her clothes, one by one, until she stand naked in full view of Gyges. And indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined.
F	KATHARINE	But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, she said this -
F	CLIFTON	Off with his head!
M	KATHERINE	#NAME? death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place.
M	KATHERINE	So Gyges killed the King and married the Queen and became ruler of Lydia for twenty eight years. The End. Do I spin the bottle?
M	MADOX	And let that be a lesson to you!
F	HANA	Are you asleep?
M	THE PATIENT	Yes. Dropping off.
M	MADOX	What did you think you were doing in his tent?
M	ALMÁSY	Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.
M	MADOX	You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
M	ALMÁSY	Her hands and feet were tied.
M	MADOX	What did you do?
M	ALMÁSY	I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard.
M	MADOX	I was talking about the girl.
M	ALMÁSY	Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl wouldn't leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel.
F	HANA	I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
M	THE PATIENT	I can already see.
F	HANA	How? How can you see anything?
M	THE PATIENT	Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.
F	HANA	I'm turning you.
M	THE PATIENT	Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
F	HANA	No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
M	THE PATIENT	I can see my wife in that view.
F	HANA	Are you remembering more?
M	THE PATIENT	Could I have a cigarette?
F	HANA	Are you crazy?
M	THE PATIENT	Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
F	HANA	Because I'm a nurse.
F	HANA	How are you?
M	BOY	Okay.
F	HANA	Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
M	BOY	You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
M	HANNA	I don't think so.
M	BOY	Would you kiss me?
F	HANA	No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples. You'll find a girl there.
M	BOY	Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to me.
F	HANA	Would it?
M	BOY	Thank you.
M	#1 INJURED MAN	Nurse - I can't sleep.
M	#2 INJURED MAN	Nurse? Would you kiss me?
M	#3 INJURED MAN	You're so pretty!
M	#4 INJURED MAN	Hinky-dinky parlez-vous!
F	HANA	Very funny. Go to sleep.
F	MARY	Don't ask.
F	HANA	Where are we going? I don't want to be kissing in a crowd. I have six hours.
M	STUART	Whoa - give me a chance!
F	HANA	Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.
M	STUART	I've got a surprise. A boat! We can go to Capri. It's got a cabin, it's private.
F	HANA	I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
M	STUART	We can do that when we're very very old.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Buon' Giorno!
M	CARAVAGGIO	Are you Hana?
F	HANA	What do you want?
M	CARAVAGGIO	I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour.
F	HANA	Bonjour.
M	CARAVAGGIO	I'd like to take credit, but it's from Mary. My name's David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David. Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on.
M	CARAVAGGIO	They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in...have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
F	HANA	You were in Africa?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Yeah, for a while.
F	HANA	So was my Patient.
M	CARAVAGGIO	I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be - #NAME? relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
F	HANA	So you can shoot a pistol?
M	CARAVAGGIO	No.
F	HANA	If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
M	CARAVAGGIO	I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep.
F	HANA	Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Fine. I'm not looking.
F	HANA	There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay.
M	THE PATIENT	Why? Can he lay eggs?
F	HANA	He's Canadian.
M	THE PATIENT	Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
F	HANA	He needn't disturb you.
M	THE PATIENT	Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.
F	HANA	He won't disturb us then. I think he's after morphine. There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
M	ALMÁSY	How much did you pay?
F	KATHARINE	Hello! Good morning.
M	ALMÁSY	They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay?
F	KATHARINE	Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
M	ALMÁSY	Which stall?
F	KATHARINE	Excuse me?
M	ALMÁSY	You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
F	KATHARINE	I don't want to go back.
M	ALMÁSY	This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
F	KATHARINE	I don't care to bargain.
M	ALMÁSY	That insults them.
F	KATHARINE	I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
M	ALMÁSY	I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social graces. How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids?
F	KATHARINE	Excuse me.
F	CLIFTON	Gentlemen, good evening!
M	D'AGOSTINO	How is your charming wife?
F	CLIFTON	Uh, marvelous. She's in love with the hotel plumbing. She's either in the swimming pool - she swims for hours, she's a fish, quite incredible - or she's in the bath. Actually, she's just outside. Chaps Only in the Long Bar.
M	MADOX	Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
F	CLIFTON	Oh no, really. She has her book.
M	MADOX	I won't hear of it. None of us will.
M	MADOX	Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women.
F	KATHARINE	Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by book. Please. Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
F	CLIFTON	The team is in mourning, darling.
F	KATHARINE	Oh really?
M	MADOX	I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
F	KATHARINE	How awful. What will you do?
M	MADOX	A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist.
F	CLIFTON	Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
M	MADOX	Very much so. We are all, save my friend here.
F	CLIFTON	I feel much better, don't you darling? We were feeling rather self-conscious. Let's toast, then. To absent wives.
M	D'AGOSTINO	And present ones.
F	KATHARINE	And future ones.
F	KATHARINE	Why did you follow me yesterday?
M	ALMÁSY	Excuse me?
F	KATHARINE	After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
M	ALMÁSY	I was concerned. As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
F	KATHARINE	You felt obliged to.
M	ALMÁSY	As the wife of one of our party.
F	KATHARINE	So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it?
F	CLIFTON	I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
F	KATHARINE	Darling, for goodness' sake!
F	CLIFTON	Well, she is!
M	CARAVAGGIO	Hello.
M	THE PATIENT	Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Thief, I think, is more accurate.
M	THE PATIENT	I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Oh, all over.
M	THE PATIENT	All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
F	HANA	Then I'm definitely going.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Does she have war wounds?
M	THE PATIENT	I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Are you planning to be the exception?
M	THE PATIENT	Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
M	CARAVAGGIO	And you've forgotten yours.
M	THE PATIENT	I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
M	CARAVAGGIO	I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name. What about your rank or serial number?
M	THE PATIENT (O/S)	No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.
M	OFFICER	Do you remember where you were born?
M	THE PATIENT	Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
M	OFFICER	Why? Are you German?
M	THE PATIENT	No.
M	OFFICER	How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
M	THE PATIENT	You tell me. I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
M	OFFICER	This was your garden?
M	THE PATIENT	Or my wife's.
M	OFFICER	Then you were married?
M	THE PATIENT	I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
M	THE PATIENT	Thank you. Look - my lungs are useless - I've got this much lung...the rest of my organs are packing up - what could it possibly matter if I were Tutankhamun? I'm a bit of toast, my friend - butter me and slip a poached egg on top.
M	STUART	My leave is canceled. I can't meet you later.
F	HANA	Excuse me -
M	THE PATIENT	Yes?
F	HANA	Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
M	THE PATIENT	Your friend?
F	HANA	He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise.
M	THE PATIENT	Just go off. I'll be quite all right.
F	HANA	No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
M	THE PATIENT	Well then - yes. Of course.
F	HANA	Thank you. Thank you.
F	HANA	This is Captain McGann.
M	THE PATIENT	Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
M	STUART	Thanks.
M	THE PATIENT	I'm going to sing. If I sing I shan't hear anything.
F	HANA	You've got a mustache.
M	STUART	A bit of one.
F	HANA	I was looking forward to this evening.
M	STUART	I had a hotel room.
F	HANA	I thought that was for when we were very very old?
M	STUART	I'm feeling old.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Supper.
F	HANA	Where've you been?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Rabbit hunting.
F	HANA	I could help you. I could get you off that.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
F	HANA	It's a week. We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
M	CARAVAGGIO	You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out?
F	HANA	What do you do? What are you doing here?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Some gave me a dress. You know what's great? What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
M	THE PATIENT	Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving -
F	HANA	He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
M	THE PATIENT	That's a different dress.
F	HANA	He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
M	THE PATIENT	Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits.
F	KATHARINE	Hello. Not to interrupt but we're celebrating.
M	ALMÁSY	This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich. I'm telling her your map is poetry.
F	KATHARINE	What do you mean, poetry?
M	ALMÁSY	A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
F	KATHARINE	Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
M	ALMÁSY	The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer. Haunting the ostrich.
M	ALMÁSY	Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from this one animal. So, each day the man gets closer. And the ostrich is not sure - has something changed? - now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds. And then one day, the man is in the wadi, in the water. And the Ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the man JUMPS UP - and captures it.
F	KATHARINE	What is he saying? Come on, what did he say?
M	ALMÁSY	He said - be careful.
F	KATHARINE	Be careful? You mean you - or me? Who?
M	ALMÁSY	Her or me?
M	ALMÁSY	The one who appears not to be moving.
F	CLIFTON	Gentlemen, to Zerzura.
M	ALL	Zerzura.
M	MADOX	And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund-raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels.
F	CLIFTON	To arm-twisting.
M	MADOX	Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
F	CLIFTON	Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
F	KATHARINE	Darling, Peter says I could stay...
M	MADOX	Why not?
M	ALMÁSY	What kind of photographs?
F	CLIFTON	Portraits. The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
F	KATHARINE	Why do you think? About my staying?
F	CLIFTON	Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft...
F	KATHARINE	Oh.
F	CLIFTON	But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
M	ALMÁSY	Safe journey.
F	CLIFTON	You too. Good luck!
M	ALMÁSY	Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
F	CLIFTON	Appropriate?
M	ALMÁSY	I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
F	CLIFTON	Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
M	ALMÁSY	All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
F	CLIFTON	I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife. I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her. I think she's know herself.
M	ALMÁSY	Very well.
F	CLIFTON	Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
F	KATHARINE	I've been thinking about - how does somebody like you decide to come to the desert? What is it? You're doing whatever you're doing - in your castle, or wherever it is you live, and one day, you say, I have to go to the desert - or what?
M	ALMÁSY	I once traveled with a terrific guide, who was taking me to Faya. He didn't speak for nine hours. At the end of it he pointed at the horizon and said - Faya! That was a good day!
F	KATHARINE	Actually, you sing.
M	ALMÁSY	Pardon?
F	KATHARINE	You sing. All the time.
M	ALMÁSY	I do not.
F	KATHARINE	Ask Al Auf.
F	KATHARINE	I'll be down to get you in the taxi, honey, you'd better be ready about half-past eight...!
M	AL AUF	Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar...
M	ALMÁSY	Madox! Madox!
M	MADOX	My God, they're swimming!
M	D'AGOSTINO	Have you seen this? Astonishing. Perfectly preserved.
M	BERMANN	I love the desert, you see. That's my, that's my - I can't think of the word. How do you explain? To someone who's never been here? Feelings which seem quite normal.
M	ALMÁSY	I don't know, my friend. I don't know.
M	MADOX	I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
M	ALMÁSY	Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
M	MADOX	Bermann!
M	KAMAL	May God make safety your companion.
F	KATHARINE	I shall stay behind, of course
M	MADOX	Certainly not.
F	KATHARINE	I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us.
M	ALMÁSY	What's this?
F	KATHARINE	I thought you might paste them into your book.
M	ALMÁSY	We took several photographs, there's no need.
F	KATHARINE	I'd like you to have them.
M	ALMÁSY	There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you.
F	KATHARINE	And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes. Of course it would.
M	ALMÁSY	You should come into the shelter.
F	KATHARINE	I'm quite all right, thank you.
M	ALMÁSY	Look over there.
F	KATHARINE	What am I looking at? See what's happening to them - the stars.
F	KATHARINE	They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
M	ALMÁSY	In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
F	KATHARINE	This is not very good, is it?
M	ALMÁSY	No.
F	KATHARINE	Shall we be all right?
M	ALMÁSY	Yes. Absolutely.
F	KATHARINE	Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not. ...let me tell you about winds. There is a whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the Aajej, against which the fellahin defend themselves with knives. The Ghibli from Tunis rolls and rolls and produces a rather strange nervous condition...
M	ALMÁSY	#NAME? Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood.
F	KATHARINE	Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More.
M	ALMÁSY	All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
F	KATHARINE	Our tracks, where are they?
M	ALMÁSY	Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
F	KATHARINE	Oh my God, the others!
M	ALMÁSY	Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored.
F	KATHARINE	Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
M	ALMÁSY	Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
F	KATHARINE	Find that plant. Cut out its heart.
M	ALMÁSY	Kamal is passing blood. He must have had some internal damage in the crash. He needs medicine. I think we must risk the other flare.
F	KATHARINE	Geoffrey's not in Cairo. He's not actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
M	ALMÁSY	And the marriage - is that a fiction?
F	KATHARINE	No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
F	KATHARINE	Thank God. Oh, thank God.
F	KATHARINE	Do they know them?
M	ALMÁSY	No, but I think I do.
F	KATHARINE	Am I K. in your book? I think I must be.
M	FENELON-BARNES	I recollect your saying to ignore your bones but I assume you have no objection to my rescuing your companion? Good evening, Mrs. Clifton.
F	KATHARINE	Hello.
M	FENELON-BARNES	I'd like to introduce you to my camel - the most notable beast on earth. I understand you found some remarkable caves.
M	FENELON-BARNES	Paintings of swimmers? Remarkable.
F	KATHARINE	Will you not come in?
M	ALMÁSY	No.
F	KATHARINE	Will you please come in?
M	ALMÁSY	Mrs. Clifton -
F	KATHARINE	Don't.
M	ALMÁSY	I believe you still have my book.
F	KATHARINE	You still have sand in your hair.
F	KATHARINE	I'm impressed you can sew.
M	ALMÁSY	Good.
F	KATHARINE	You sew very badly.
M	ALMÁSY	You don't sew at all!
F	KATHARINE	A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes.
M	ALMÁSY	That makes it harder still.
M	ALMÁSY	When were you most happy?
F	KATHARINE	Now.
M	ALMÁSY	When were you least happy?
F	KATHARINE	Now. Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
F	KATHARINE	What do I love? I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
M	ALMÁSY	What else?
F	KATHARINE	Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. What do you hate most?
F	KATHARINE	A lie. What do you hate most?
M	ALMÁSY	Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.
M	THE PATIENT	Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
F	HANA	Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me.
F	HANA	I'm so sorry.
F	MARY	Okay, Type Os, the vampires wait. Everybody's giving a pint.
F	JAN	Ugh! If they were sucking it out I wouldn't mind. It's the needle I can't stand.
F	HANA	You're a nurse - how ca you be frightened of needles!
M	WOUNDED SOLDIER	Can't wait to have me dead? You bitch!
F	HANA	Try t be calm. Ssssshhh. Come on. Be calm now. Ssshhhh. Be peaceful. It's okay. It's okay.
M	CANADIAN SOLDIER	Is there anybody here from Picton?
M	OLIVER	Picton? I don't know.
M	CANADIAN SOLDIER	I'd like to see somebody from home before I go.
F	HANA	Why Picton?
M	OLIVER	He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
F	JAN	Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
F	HANA	As him what company he's with?
M	OLIVER	Third Canadian Fusiliers.
F	HANA	Does he know a Captain McGann?
M	CANADIAN SOLDIER	He bought it. Yesterday. Shot to bits.
F	HANA	What did he say?
M	OLIVER	Doesn't know him.
F	HANA	He's gone, hasn't he?
M	OLIVER	No. He's - no.
F	HANA	Oh God. Oh God.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Hana? Hana? Are you alright?
F	HANA	Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
M	CARAVAGGIO	I'll have some of your water. It's hot.
M	CARAVAGGIO	You have to protect yourself from sadness. This is the thing I've learned. You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient. Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he looks? I don't think he is.
F	HANA	I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Who are his ghosts?
F	HANA	Ask him.
M	CARAVAGGIO	What if I told you he did this to me?
F	HANA	What? How could he have? When?
M	CARAVAGGIO	I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
F	HANA	I don't know what that means.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
F	HANA	Please don't creep around this house.
F	HANA	Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire... I love that, I believe that. Who is K?
M	THE PATIENT	K is for Katharine.
M	ALMÁSY	Say you're sick.
F	KATHARINE	What? No!
M	ALMÁSY	Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
F	KATHARINE	No.
M	ALMÁSY	I can't work. I can't sleep.
M	LADY HAMPTON	Katharine!
F	KATHARINE	Coming. I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
M	ALMÁSY	I can still taste you.
F	KATHARINE	This is empty, just coming!
M	ALMÁSY	I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you.
F	KATHARINE	I'm fine. How silly.
M	OFFICER'S WIFE	It's the heat.
M	LADY HAMPTON	You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant?
F	KATHARINE	I don't think so.
M	LADY HAMPTON	How romantic. With Fiona I fell over every five minutes. Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
F	KATHARINE	I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
M	LADY HAMPTON	I'll come with you.
F	KATHARINE	No, please. I shall be absolutely fine.
F	CLIFTON	Have you seen Katharine?
M	ALMÁSY	What?
F	CLIFTON	It's Geoffrey under this.
M	ALMÁSY	I haven't, no. Sorry.
F	CLIFTON	Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right?
F	KATHARINE	I'm fine. I got hot.
F	CLIFTON	Lady H said she thought you might be -
F	KATHARINE	I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
F	CLIFTON	Right.
F	KATHARINE	Aren't you?
F	CLIFTON	Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.
F	KATHARINE	Can't we really go home? I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow. If you wanted.
F	CLIFTON	Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
F	KATHARINE	Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
F	CLIFTON	I do so love you. What do you smell of?
F	KATHARINE	What?
F	CLIFTON	Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
M	THE PATIENT	Are you outside?
M	CARAVAGGIO	I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
M	THE PATIENT	I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Is it you? If I said Moose... I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
M	THE PATIENT	Moose.
M	CARAVAGGIO	First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
M	THE PATIENT	I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.
M	THE PATIENT	I have come to love that little tap of the fingernail against the syringe. Tap.
F	HANA	Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door.
M	KIP	The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
F	HANA	I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German.
M	KIP	Is something funny?
F	HANA	No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and - #NAME? worried about mines. That's all.
M	KIP	I've met you before.
F	HANA	I don't think so.
F	HANA	He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him. He's Indian, he wears a turban.
M	THE PATIENT	Sikh. If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
F	HANA	I'll probably marry him.
M	THE PATIENT	Really? That's sudden.
F	HANA	My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
F	HANA	I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
M	THE PATIENT	Why? Is he staying?
F	HANA	With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
M	THE PATIENT	We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
F	HANA	They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
M	THE PATIENT	In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
F	CLIFTON	Darling, it's me, I'm sorry, something's come up. Don't sulk - I'll be back tomorrow evening. I promise. Okay my precious, I love you.
M	RUPERT	I didn't know you were going anywhere?
F	CLIFTON	I'm not. I'm going to surprise her. It's our anniversary. She's forgotten, of course. What's the symbol for your first anniversary? I should get something. Is it paper? Moose! Moose, you there? First Anniversary - is it cotton?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Is what cotton?
F	CLIFTON	First Wedding Anniversary.
M	RUPERT	He's hopeless!
F	CLIFTON	Your day will come, my sausage.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Your first anniversary is Paper.
F	CLIFTON	Stop!
M	CABBIE	Please?
F	CLIFTON	Stop here.
M	CABBIE	Yessir.
F	KATHARINE	This is - what is this?
M	ALMÁSY	It's a folk song.
F	KATHARINE	Arabic? No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
F	KATHARINE	It's beautiful. What's it about?
M	ALMÁSY	It's a long song - Szerelem means love...and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool. For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave. He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
M	ALMÁSY	Ouch! See - you're always beating me..!
F	KATHARINE	You bastard, I was believing you!
M	ALMÁSY	I claim this shoulder blade - oh no, wait - I want this!
M	ALMÁSY	This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine! I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
F	KATHARINE	I thought we were against ownership? I can stay tonight.
M	ALMÁSY	Madox knows, I think. He's tried to warn me. He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
F	KATHARINE	This is a different world - is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife.
M	ALMÁSY	Yes. A different wife.
F	CLIFTON	Sorry.
M	CABBIE	Hotel now, sir?
M	GEOFFREY	No.
M	ALMÁSY	I don't care to bargain. It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
F	KATHARINE	That day, had you followed me to the market? Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
F	KATHARINE	Shall we be all right?
M	ALMÁSY	Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Thought you'd never wake up!
M	THE PATIENT	What?
F	HANA	Where did you find that?
M	CARAVAGGIO	I liberated it.
F	HANA	I think that's called looting.
M	CARAVAGGIO	No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song?
M	THE PATIENT	Irving Berlin.
M	CARAVAGGIO	For?
M	THE PATIENT	Top Hat.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Is there a song you don't know?
F	HANA	No. He sings all the time.
F	HANA	Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing?
M	THE PATIENT	I've been told that before.
F	HANA	Kip's another one.
F	HANA	Hello.
M	HARDY	Hello miss.
F	HANA	I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever... you and Lieutenant Singh...
M	HARDY	Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
F	HANA	Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
M	HARDY	I'll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you.
F	HANA	You saved my life. I haven't forgotten. I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
M	HARDY	A toddler
F	HANA	Sorry, is it all right I'm seeing this?
F	HANA	My hair was long. At some point. I've forgotten what a nuisance it is to wash. You know - if you were ever around - we get water from the pump at noon.
F	HANA	Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
M	KIP	Thank you.
M	KIP	For my hair?
F	HANA	Yes, for your hair. Because you're reading it too fast! Not at all. You have to read Kipling slowly! Your eye is too impatient - think about the speed of his pen. What is it - He sat comma in defiance of municipal orders comma astride the gun Zamzammah on her brick... What is it?
M	KIP	Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
M	THE PATIENT	#NAME? natives called the Lahore Museum.
M	KIP	It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
M	THE PATIENT	So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
M	KIP	What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk. And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
M	THE PATIENT	Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
F	HANA	Arguing about books.
M	THE PATIENT	Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
M	KIP	I'll get another tin.
F	HANA	I didn't like that book either. It's all about men. Too many men. Just like this house.
M	THE PATIENT	You like him, don't you? Your voice changes.
F	HANA	I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
M	THE PATIENT	I don't think it's indifference.
M	THE PATIENT	Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
F	HANA	Hey! -
M	THE PATIENT	#NAME?
M	KIP	Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not Hana's cooking in particular. Have either of you ever tried condensed milk sandwiches?
M	THE PATIENT	Careful - careful!
M	THE PATIENT	This is wonderful!
M	KIP	What's he saying?
F	HANA	He's saying it's wonderful!
M	MADOX	And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
M	ALMÁSY	No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple! Look! What is that? Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility...
M	MADOX	Which we've overflown twice.
M	ALMÁSY	Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy. And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
M	MADOX	So - on Thursday you don't trust Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map, but on Friday he's suddenly infallible?
M	MADOX	And where are the Expedition Maps?
M	ALMÁSY	In my room.
M	MADOX	Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of. What's the matter with you?
M	MADOX	Don't be so bloody naïve. You know there's a war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
M	ALMÁSY	Why do they care about our maps?
M	MADOX	What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
M	ALMÁSY	Own the desert.
M	ALMÁSY	That place at the base of a woman's throat? You know - the hollow - here - does that have an official name?
M	MADOX	For God's sake, man - pull yourself together.
M	SOLDIER	Beggin your pardon, miss, but have you got a lighter?
M	SOLDIER	I love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?
F	KATHARINE	Fuck off.
M	SOLDIER	What?
F	KATHARINE	You heard me.
M	ALMÁSY	Sorry.
F	KATHARINE	I can't do this, I can't do this any more.
F	KATHARINE	I'd better get back. Say goodbye here.
M	ALMÁSY	I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
F	KATHARINE	I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
M	ALMÁSY	Don't go over it again, please.
M	ALMÁSY	Katharine -
M	ALMÁSY	I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet.
F	KATHARINE	You will. You will.
M	THE PATIENT	I'm still here.
F	HANA	You'd better be.
M	THE PATIENT	Don't depend on it. Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
M	THE PATIENT	I've been talking to Caravaggio - my research assistant - there's meant to be a ghost in the Cloisters. I can join him!
M	THE PATIENT	It's the boy.
M	KIP	Go to the left! Keep to the left! There are mines and trip wires everywhere!
M	KIP	Get Hardy. He's on the other side of town. In the hills. Get him to hurry.
F	HANA	It's okay - I'll help. Please.
M	KIP	The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
F	HANA	What do I do?
M	KIP	There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
F	HANA	So I follow the wires?
M	KIP	You get Hardy.
F	HANA	I follow the wires.
M	KIP	Don't touch them.
F	HANA	Why would anyone do this?
M	KIP	I've done this. I've had to do this.
F	HANA	Give me a second.
M	KIP	What are you doing?! Hana!
M	KIP	What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
F	HANA	I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.
M	KIP	Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
F	HANA	I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy.
M	KIP	You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here.
F	HANA	Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
M	KIP	No.
F	HANA	Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
M	KIP	Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut.
M	THE PATIENT	Hana! Hana! Kip! Hana!
F	HANA	I'm sorry. I forgot you'd be worrying. We're all safe. It was a mine, but not the mine. Nobody's hurt. I'm sorry.
M	SOLDIER	And you're definitely traveling with him of your own free will?
F	HANA	Yes.
M	SOLDIER	Just wanting to be sure. And he's taking you to church?
F	HANA	Yes. We're going to a funeral. A cow has died. And in his religion they're sacred.
F	HANA	Kip?
M	THE PATIENT	There was a general who wore a patch over a perfectly good eye. The men fought harder for him. Sometimes I think I could get up and dance. What's under your bandages?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Hold the ends.
M	AICHA	He's waiting for you.
M	FENELON-BARNES	What a bloody flap, eh? I heard from Alexandria this morning - apparently no-one there is accepting British pounds. And if you pick up a telephone everybody's practicing their German. What do you do - do you take these things? Look, Moose, we need you to stay in Tobruk. A bit of a short straw but the thinking is we'll be back - I mean, we will be back - but...and in the interim we need eyes and ears on the ground.
M	CARAVAGGIO	We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk. What are they going to be doing?
M	FENELON-BARNES	Giving Rommel a bloody nose. That's my suggestion. But did you hear the BBC last nigh? Tobruk is of no strategic importance - makes you wonder.
M	FENELON-BARNES	Jerry's got our maps you know. Swines. Before the war we helped them run about the desert making maps - and now they get spies into Cairo using our maps, they'll get Rommel into Cairo using our maps. The whole of the desert like a bus route and we gave it to them. Any foreigner who turned up - welcome to the Royal Geographic, take our maps. Madox went mad, you know - you knew Peter Madox? - after he found out he'd been betrayed by his friend. Absolutely destroyed the poor sod. Shot himself in a church in Dorset.
M	FENELON-BARNES	I'd like to get that bastard Almásy - settle the score, eh? That's my fantasy - said he, clearing out. Must have been a spy all along.
M	MÜLLER	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
M	MÜLLER	David Caravaggio.
M	CARAVAGGIO	No.
M	MÜLLER	Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
M	CARAVAGGIO	I keep explaining. You've got the wrong man. My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini. Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
M	MÜLLER	Is this you?
M	CARAVAGGIO	I don't know.
M	MÜLLER	It is you. This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41. And this -February 42.
M	CARAVAGGIO	It's impossible. I was buying or selling something. I've been to Cairo many times.
M	MÜLLER	You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies. Code-name Moose.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Could I have a doctor? I am passing blood. I must be bleeding internally. Can you get a doctor? Look - I'm leaking blood. He kicks me. He kicks me all the time.
M	CLERK	He's asking for a doctor.
M	MÜLLER	You want a doctor?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
M	MÜLLER	We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
M	CARAVAGGIO	A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great.
M	MÜLLER	Leave it and get the nurse!
M	MÜLLER	Why is there so much nose? I can't hear myself think! Look - give me something. So we can all get out of this room. A name. A code. It's too hot.
M	CARAVAGGIO	I slept with the girl. I've got a wife in Tripoli. A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
M	MÜLLER	I'll tell you what I'm going to do. This is your nurse, by the way. She's Moslem, so she'll understand all of this. What's the punishment for adultery? Let's leave it at that. You're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's - is it the hands that are cut off? Or is that for stealing? Does anyone know?
M	MÜLLER	Well, you must know. You were brought up Libya, yes?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Don't cut me.
M	MÜLLER	Or was it Toronto?
M	CARAVAGGIO	Don't cut me. Come on.
M	MÜLLER	Ten fingers. How about this? You give me a name for every finger - doesn't matter who. I get something, you keep something. I'm trying to be reasonable. Fenelon-Barnes, we could call that two names. Are thumbs fingers? Is a thumb a finger?
M	MÜLLER	I get no help from these people.
M	CLERK	The telephone -
M	MÜLLER	What are you doing?
M	STENOGRAPHER	That Geneva Convention. I'm -
M	CARAVAGGIO	You can't do that! Hey - come on!
M	MÜLLER	Go! Hey! Go!
M	CARAVAGGIO	Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Listen, I'll give you a name. What name did you say? I knew them! I promise. Please - please!
M	MÜLLER	Cut the other thumb.
M	MÜLLER	This one! Come on!
M	CARAVAGGIO	The man who took my thumbs, I found him eventually - he's dead. The man who took my photograph, I found him too - that took me a year. He's dead. Another man took that man across the desert to Cairo. Now I intend to find him.
M	ALMÁSY	I believe I'm rather late.
M	MADOX	Good, we're all here? A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
M	THE OTHERS	The International Sand Club!
M	ALMÁSY	Misfits, buggers, fascists, and paedophiles. God bless us every one.
M	ALMÁSY	Oops! Mustn't say International. Dirty word. Filthy word. His Majesty! Die Führer! Il Duce.
F	CLIFTON	Sorry, what's your point?
M	ALMÁSY	And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials... - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood. Isn't that right? What's my point? Oh! I've invented a new dance - the Bosphorus Hug. Anybody up to it? Madox? D'Ag? Come on D'Aggers.
M	D'AGOSTINO	Let's eat first. Sit down.
M	ALMÁSY	...We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish we'll frighten when we're in. your bathing suit so thin will make the shellfish grin, fin to fin. -- Those were the words - actually - before they were cleaned up. Could be a song for you, Mrs. Clifton - #NAME?
M	MADOX	Look, either shut up, or go home.
M	ALMÁSY	Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
M	ALMÁSY	Why did you hold his collar?
F	KATHARINE	What?
M	ALMÁSY	What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
F	KATHARINE	Would you let me pass?
M	ALMÁSY	Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it?
F	KATHARINE	Don't do this.
M	ALMÁSY	I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there? How can you ever smile? As if your life hadn't capsized?
F	KATHARINE	You know why?
M	ALMÁSY	Dance with me.
F	KATHARINE	No.
M	ALMÁSY	Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
F	KATHARINE	Do you think you're the only one who feels anything? Is that what you think?
M	THE PATIENT	Why don't you go? You should sleep.
F	HANA	Would you like me to?
M	KIP (O/S)	Hana.
F	HANA	Kip.
M	HARDY	I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
F	HANA	He's sleeping.
M	HARDY	Only we have to go to work.
F	HANA	I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
M	HARDY	A bomb. At the Viaduct.
F	HANA	Does he have to go?
M	HARDY	Pardon me?
F	HANA	What if you couldn't find him...? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
M	KIP	What's happening? Am I needed?
M	HARDY	I'm afraid so, sir.
F	HANA	Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
M	KIP	This is what I do. I do this every day.
M	KIP	Serial number - KK-1P2600.
M	KIP	Hardy! Hardy! What's happening?!
M	HARDY	Corporal!? Dade!!
M	DADE	Tanks, sir. Don't know what it's about. God only knows.
M	HARDY	What is this - a bloody carnival? Stop them!
M	HARDY	You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
M	KIP	Go away.
M	HARDY	Yessir.
M	KIP	This is making me incredibly angry.
M	KIP	Kiss me.
M	HARDY	Get a blanket! Dade! Get the Lieutenant a blanket.
M	DADE	It's over, Sarge. It's over. Jerry's surrendered. Sir, congratulations!
M	KIP	Congratulations.
F	HANA	Kip!
F	HANA	Kip - come and dance with me
M	KIP	Yes. Later.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Have a drink.
M	THE PATIENT	I've had a drink. Fatal.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
M	THE PATIENT	Very true!
M	THE PATIENT	Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
F	HANA	Never heard of it.
M	THE PATIENT	That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
M	CARAVAGGIO	What? You and Madox? Or you and Katharine Clifton?
M	THE PATIENT	What?
F	HANA	What was that?
M	SPALDING	Booby trap. They was running up the Union Jack, sir, up off that statue - It just went off.
M	DADE	Should have been me. It was my idea but Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir, him and Blackler.
M	SPALDING	Sir - you don't want to look.
M	KIP	Who's that girl?
M	DADE	His fiancee, sir.
M	KIP	Hardy's?
M	DADE	Kept it a bit dark.
M	KIP	I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some - he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean - and us - he never once... He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
F	HANA	You loved him.
F	HANA	If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do? KIP I try not to expect you.
F	HANA	But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
M	KIP	Then I'd think there must be a reason.
F	HANA	You wouldn't come to find me? That makes me never want to come here.
F	HANA	Then I tell myself he spends all day searching, in the night he wants to be found.
M	MADOX	Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still...
M	ALMÁSY	Right.
M	MADOX	Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but... And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
M	ALMÁSY	I told you so.
M	MADOX	We didn't care about countries. Did we? Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was something finer than that.
M	ALMÁSY	Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
M	MADOX	When's Clifton picking you up?
M	ALMÁSY	Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready.
M	MADOX	I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it...hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two.
M	MADOX	I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
M	ALMÁSY	Goodbye, my friend.
M	MADOX	May God make safety your companion.
M	ALMÁSY	There is no God. But I hope someone looks after you.
M	MADOX	In case you're still wondering - this is called the supasternal notch.
M	MADOX	Come and visit us in Dorset. When all this nonsense is over. You'll never come to Dorset.
F	HANA	Sometimes I need you to find me.
M	THE PATIENT	Hana tells me you're leaving.
M	CARAVAGGIO	There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
M	THE PATIENT	We shall miss you.
M	CARAVAGGIO	So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - #NAME? full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
M	THE PATIENT	Me?
M	CARAVAGGIO	I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
M	THE PATIENT	I see.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
M	THE PATIENT	And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
M	CARAVAGGIO	You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
M	THE PATIENT	I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me.
M	CARAVAGGIO	What did you say?
M	THE PATIENT	The rest meant nothing to me.
M	CARAVAGGIO	There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
M	THE PATIENT	Thousands of people did die, just different people.
M	CARAVAGGIO	But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
M	THE PATIENT	Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me.
M	ALMÁSY	Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
F	KATHARINE	I can't move. I can't get out.
M	ALMÁSY	Why did he bring you?
F	KATHARINE	A surprise, he said.
F	KATHARINE	Poor Geoffrey. He knew. He must have known all the time. He was shouting - I love you, Katharine, I love you so much. Is he badly hurt? His neck is odd.
F	KATHARINE	Please don't move me. It hurts too much.
M	ALMÁSY	We've got to get you out of here. It hurts too much.
M	ALMÁSY	I know, darling, I'm sorry.
F	KATHARINE	Why did you hate me?
M	ALMÁSY	What?
F	KATHARINE	Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
M	ALMÁSY	Don't talk.
F	KATHARINE	You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
M	ALMÁSY	You're wearing the thimble.
F	KATHARINE	Of course. You idiot. I always wear it. I've always worn it. I've always loved you.
F	KATHARINE	It's so cold.
M	ALMÁSY	I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
F	KATHARINE	Don't leave me!
M	ALMÁSY	I'm just going to find things for the fire.
F	KATHARINE	Shall we be all right?
M	ALMÁSY	Yes. Absolutely.
F	KATHARINE	Oh dear.
M	ALMÁSY	Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
F	KATHARINE	Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you.
M	ALMÁSY	I promise I'll come back. I promise I'll never leave you. And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
M	ALMÁSY	And a good read. Don't waste it.
F	KATHARINE	Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
M	ALMÁSY	I'm sorry, Katharine.
F	KATHARINE	I know. Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
M	ALMÁSY	Tell me about your garden.
F	KATHARINE	Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil's Chimney it was called - The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why. Darling. My darling.
M	THE PATIENT'S (O/S)	Seventy miles, north - north west. I had Madox's compass. A man can walk in the desert as fast as a camel. That's about two and a half miles an hour. I stopped at noon and at twilight. Three days there, I told her, then three hours back by jeep. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back.
M	OFFICER	Good morning!
M	ALMÁSY	Could I trouble you for some water?
M	OFFICER	Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
M	ALMÁSY	I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.
M	OFFICER	I see.
M	ALMÁSY	No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and... Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
M	OFFICER	Do you have your papers, sir?
M	ALMÁSY	What?
M	OFFICER	If I could just see some identification.
M	ALMÁSY	Am I not talking sense? - forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
M	OFFICER	Right. And what's your name, sir?
M	ALMÁSY	Count Laszlo de Almásy.
M	OFFICER	Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me? What nationality would that be?
M	ALMÁSY	Look, listen to me. A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three days! I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
M	OFFICER	I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
M	ALMÁSY	No! NO! Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
M	ALMÁSY	Hey! Hey! Stop this jeep! Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
M	CORPORAL	Shut-up!
M	ALMÁSY	Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying.
M	CORPORAL	Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
M	ALMÁSY	Fritz? What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
M	CORPORAL	That's your name innit? Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
M	ALMÁSY	Let me out, let me out, let me out - Katharine! Katharine!
M	ALMÁSY	Excuse me. I also need to use the lavatory.
M	SOLDIER	You'll have to wait. Sarge! Jerry wants to use the lav - says it's urgent.
M	ALMÁSY	Where are we going, please?
M	SOLDIER	To the coast. Benghazi. Soon be there. Get a boat home. You'll be all right.
M	SERGEANT	What's up?
M	ALMÁSY	Cramps. It's urgent.
M	SERGEANT	Go on then - you take him.
M	THE PATIENT	So yes. She died because of me. Because I loved her. Because I had the wrong name.
F	HANA	What are you up to?
M	KIP	That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns.
M	KIP	When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
F	HANA	I should go to the house, get breakfast.
M	KIP	The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him.
M	KIP	This is hot!
F	HANA	Nya-nya-nya!
M	CARAVAGGIO	And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
M	THE PATIENT	Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't... I couldn't even do that properly.
M	CARAVAGGIO	You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
M	THE PATIENT	You can't kill me. I died years ago.
M	CARAVAGGIO	No, now I can't kill you.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Kip - what are - ?
M	KIP	Stay out of this.
M	THE PATIENT	Kip?
M	KIP	I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
M	THE PATIENT	What are you talking about?
M	KIP	What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Kip, listen -
M	KIP	I said keep out of this!
M	KIP	Can you hear? Can you hear what they're celebrating? I listened to you, Uncle. Sitting at your feet - always sitting at somebody's feet - trying to learn. The right way to hold a teacup, otherwise you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie - as if everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an accent.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Kip -
M	KIP	Kip! - it's not even my name because you can't say it. Kirpal Singh Bhuller is my name.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Well, then ask him his name!
F	HANA	What's happened? Kip! What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
M	KIP	They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never!
M	THE PATIENT	Go on, do it. I don't need to hear any more.
M	CARAVAGGIO	Kip, listen, he lost everything because he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me, I'm more English than he is!
F	HANA	Kip. Kip. It's me. Why? It's another bomb. However big, what's the difference? There've been so many bombs. What about Coventry? What about Dresden? Where were those cities? I don't understand. Let me come in.
M	KIP	Will you come with me?
F	HANA	Of course. When?
M	KIP	I mean home. India.
F	HANA	Kip... I -
M	KIP	I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
F	HANA	Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
M	KIP	It's what I've learned.
F	HANA	I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
F	HANA	I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft.
M	KIP	Then come with me.
F	HANA	I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
M	KIP	I'll always go back to that church.
F	HANA	So one day we'll meet.
M	THE PATIENT	Thank you. Thank you.
M	THE PATIENT	Read to me, will you? Read me to sleep.
M	ALMÁSY	Katharine, my darling.
M	ALMÁSY	I'm so tired.
F	HANA	My darling, I'm waiting for you - how long is a day in the dark, or a week?
M	KATHARINE (O/S)	...the fire is gone now, and I'm horribly cold. I really ought to drag myself outside but then there would be the sun...
M	KATHARINE (O/S)	I'm afraid I waste the light on the paintings and on writing these words...
M	KATHARINE (O/S)	We die, we die rich with lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed...
M	CARAVAGGIO	Hana! Come on! ...bodies we have entered and swum up like rivers, fears we have hidden in like this wretched cave...
M	KATHARINE (O/S)	...I want all this marked on my body. We are the real countries, not the boundaries drawn on maps with the names of powerful men...
M	CARAVAGGIO	Hana - this is Gioia.
F	HANA	Buon' giorno.
M	CARAVAGGIO	She can take you as far as Florence.
F	HANA	I can get in the back. ...I know you will come and carry me out into the palace of winds, the rumors of water... That's all I've wanted - to walk in such a place with you, with friends, on earth without maps.
M	KATHARINE (O/S)	The lamp's gone out and I'm writing in the darkness...
