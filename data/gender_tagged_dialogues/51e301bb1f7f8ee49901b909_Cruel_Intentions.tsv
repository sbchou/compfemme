M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
M	SEBASTIAN	I know.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
M	SEBASTIAN	I know.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	There's no smoking in my office.
M	SEBASTIAN	What do you want me to say? That I'm supposed to feel remorse because I act the way I do? The truth is I don't.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Look, I'm not like all the other kids in high school. I don't care about book reports and extra-credit. Teachers are idiots anyway. The only challenge out there for me is women. You see a girl you like. You pursue them. You conquer. You move on. It's exciting.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	But you said you have the worst reputation.
M	SEBASTIAN	I do.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Don't you want to change that?
M	SEBASTIAN	Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	I think that's all the time we have for today.
M	SEBASTIAN	Same time next week?
M	DR. GREENBAUM	No. This is going to be our last session.
M	SEBASTIAN	Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
M	SEBASTIAN	Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	He was a coke addict, you know.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
M	SEBASTIAN	It works a little.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	No it doesn't. I see right through you.
M	SEBASTIAN	You do?
M	DR. GREENBAUM	I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	My daughter, Rachel.
M	SEBASTIAN	Yummy.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
M	SEBASTIAN	Really? Care to make a wager on that?
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Good luck, Sebastian.
M	SEBASTIAN	What, nervous I'm going to win?
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Would you please leave. Asshole.
M	DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)	Rachel, it's mom.
M	RACHEL	Hi, mom.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Honey, is something wrong?
M	RACHEL	He told me he loved me and I believed him.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Who told you?
M	RACHEL	You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
M	RACHEL	Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
M	DR. GREENBAUM	What kind of pictures?
M	RACHEL	Nudie pictures, what do you think?
M	DR. GREENBAUM	Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
M	RACHEL	I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there. Mom? Are you there? Mom? Mother!!!!
M	DR. GREENBAUM	You son of a bitch.
M	DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)	Fuck off, Harold.
M	METER MAID	You can't park there.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
F	KATHRYN	I'll do my best.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be all.
F	CECILE	What was that?
F	KATHRYN	I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language. Kathryn is a straight A student at Oakwood as well as being President of the French Club. Listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far.
F	KATHRYN	You're too kind.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
F	KATHRYN	I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	That's beautiful.
F	CECILE	What are the boys like?
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Cecile, is that the best you can do? You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
F	KATHRYN	Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
M	SEBASTIAN (O.S.)	I hear she's recovering quite well.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	You remember my daughter, Cecile.
M	SEBASTIAN	My, what an adorable shirt you're wearing.
F	CECILE	My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
M	SEBASTIAN	How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
F	KATHRYN	Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
M	SEBASTIAN	Outstanding.
F	CECILE	What year are you in?
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
F	CECILE	But I thought high school is only four years.
M	SEBASTIAN	It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	I think we'll be going now. Thanks for all your help.
F	KATHRYN	I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
F	CECILE	Thanks. Nice meeting you.
M	SEBASTIAN	Ciao.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Let's go, Cecile. Now!
M	SEBASTIAN	Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
F	KATHRYN	I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing. The parental units called while you were out.
M	SEBASTIAN	Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
F	KATHRYN	Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid. What's wrong with you today? Therapy not going well?
M	SEBASTIAN	It was fine.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid Manhattan Debutantes.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Nothing shocks them anymore.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my touch.
F	KATHRYN	Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
M	SEBASTIAN	What?
M	KATHRYN (V.O.)	You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret Reynolds? You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth Of July Weekend?
F	KATHRYN	He didn't dump me. We had a parting of the ways. Alright he dumped me.
M	KATMRYN (V.O.)	I went to great lengths to please Court. Huge sacrifices were made on my part to keep him happy.
M	SEBASTIAN(V.O.)	Swallow? What do you think?
M	SEBASTIAN (V.O.)	Sorry.
F	KATHRYN	In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
M	SEBASTIAN	You don't mean?
M	KATHRYN (V.O.)	None other than Cecile Caldwell.
F	KATHRYN	I don't find this very funny,
M	SEBASTIAN	So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
F	KATHRYN	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
M	SEBASTIAN	Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
F	KATHRYN	Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
M	SEBASTIAN	I see your point... though why should I care?
F	KATHRYN	I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
M	SEBASTIAN	Sounds intriguing.
F	KATHRYN	She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie. Be her Captain Picard, Valmont. Boldly go where no man has gone before.
M	SEBASTIAN	I can't.
F	KATHRYN	Why not?
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
F	KATHRYN	Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
M	SEBASTIAN	That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
F	KATHRYN	I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
M	SEBASTIAN	Shut up and turn to page 64.
F	KATHRYN	Jesus Christ, is she for real?
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
F	KATHRYN	B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
M	SEBASTIAN	It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
F	KATHRYN	You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
M	SEBASTIAN	Care to make a wager on that?
F	KATHRYN	I'll think about it...
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
F	KATHRYN	Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
M	SEBASTIAN	Could you be more desperate to read it?
F	KATHRYN	Oh Sebastian. About that little wager of yours. Count me in.
M	SEBASTIAN	What are the terms?
F	KATHRYN	If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
M	SEBASTIAN	And if I win?
F	KATHRYN	I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
M	SEBASTIAN	Be more specific.
F	KATHRYN	In English. I'll fuck your brains out.
M	SEBASTIAN	What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
F	KATHRYN	Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	Do we have a deal?
M	SEBASTIAN	No way, that car means everything to me.
F	KATHRYN	You can put it anywhere.
M	SEBASTIAN	Even there?
F	KATHRYN	It would feel so yummy. Happy hunting.
F	ANNETTE	It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
M	AUNT HELEN	Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
F	ANNETTE	My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
M	AUNT HELEN	I'm sorry about that.
F	ANNETTE	My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
M	AUNT HELEN	I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
F	ANNETTE	Ben Schwarz.
M	AUNT HELEN	Schwarz. Jewish?
F	ANNETTE	German.
M	AUNT HELEN	Doesn't ring a bell.
M	AUNT HELEN (cont'd)	In any event, I want you to consider this your home for the time being.
F	ANNETTE	Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet around here.
M	ANNETTE (cont'd)	What was that?
M	AUNT HELEN	Sebastian must be here.
M	SEBASTIAN	Pull! Die motherfucker!
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Shit, shit, shit. Kitty. Kitty.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.
M	AUNT HELEN (O.S.)	Sebastian! I've been looking all over for you. God, I've missed you.
M	AUNT HELEN	I've missed you too. How are your parents?
M	SEBASTIAN	They're coming back next week. I write them everyday.
M	AUNT HELEN	Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison. She's going to be staying with me for a few weeks.
M	SEBASTIAN	I guess that makes two of us. Welcome. Why don't you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours? We'll take care of the horses.
M	AUNT HELEN	Anything for you, my dear. Stay out of trouble you two.
M	SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE	We will.
M	SEBASTIAN	So what year are you going into?
F	ANNETTE	Junior.
M	SEBASTIAN	Got a boyfriend back home?
F	ANNETTE	No.
M	SEBASTIAN	Why not?
F	ANNETTE	I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
M	SEBASTIAN	You a lesbo?
F	ANNETTE	No.
M	SEBASTIAN	Nice.
F	ANNETTE	Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
M	SEBASTIAN	I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
M	SEBASTIAN	I read your teen beat manifesto.
F	ANNETTE	You did?
M	SEBASTIAN	I must say I found it rather appalling.
F	ANNETTE	That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
M	SEBASTIAN	Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
F	ANNETTE	I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh really?
F	ANNETTE	Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
M	SEBASTIAN	How do you know I've been with several women?
F	ANNETTE	A friend wrote me.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
F	ANNETTE	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
M	SEBASTIAN	Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
F	ANNETTE	It's not really important.
M	SEBASTIAN	Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
F	ANNETTE	Why are you being so dramatic?
M	SEBASTIAN	Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
F	ANNETTE	Alright, I said I was sorry. Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot. Annette Harrison.
M	SEBASTIAN	Sebastian Valmont.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since you've never had sex do you touch yourself?
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	What did I say?
M	RONALD (O.S.)	That's good, that's good. Now let's try the A minor scale. Once more, and remember the third note is flat.
F	CECILE	Oh, I suck. I suck.
M	RONALD	Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath. You're concentrating too much on your bowing. Let it flow. Here, let me help you. Now close your eyes and let's try again.
F	KATHRYN	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Your playing was beautiful.
F	CECILE	Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's giving me music lessons over the summer.
M	RONALD	Pleased to meet you.
F	KATHRYN	Likewise I'm sure.
F	CECILE	Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
M	RONALD	It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
F	CECILE	Doctor King is my favorite.
M	RONALD	I guess our hour's up. Same time tomorrow?
M	SEBASTIAN	Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
M	BLAINE	- none taken -
M	SEBASTIAN	- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
M	BLAINE	Any ideas who it could be?
M	SEBASTIAN	Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
M	BLAINE	Where did you say she's from?
M	SEBASTIAN	Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
M	BLAINE	Greg McConnell.
M	SEBASTIAN	The football stud?
M	BLAINE	He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
M	SEBASTIAN	It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
M	BLAINE	I don't think that bothered him.
M	SEBASTIAN	What do you mean?
M	BLAINE	Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
M	SEBASTIAN	Are you shitting me?
M	BLAINE	I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything." It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
M	SEBASTIAN	Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
M	BLAINE	Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
M	SEBASTIAN	Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
M	BLAINE	Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
M	SEBASTIAN	Outstanding.
M	BLAINE	Don't think it's not going to cost you.
M	SEBASTIAN	No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
F	KATHRYN	So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
F	CECILE	He's alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
F	KATHRYN	Really? Bulimic headcase.
F	CECILE	What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
F	KATHRYN	That's great.
F	CECILE	You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
F	KATHRYN	What are you scared of?
F	CECILE	Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
F	KATHRYN	Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
F	CECILE	Eww. No. That's gross.
F	KATHRYN	It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	Now close your eyes and wet your lips.
F	CECILE	Are you for real?
F	KATHRYN	Do you want to learn or not?
F	CECILE	I guess. It still sounds gross.
F	KATHRYN	See that wasn't so bad.
F	CECILE	It was nothing.
F	KATHRYN	Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
F	CECILE	Okay.
F	KATHRYN	Eyes closed. Not bad.
F	CECILE	That was cool.
F	KATHRYN	Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
F	CECILE	What are you saying?
F	KATHRYN	Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
F	CECILE	Is it that obvious? He sends me letters you know. Love letters.
F	KATHRYN	That's so romantic. Have you responded?
F	CECILE	No.
F	KATHRYN	Well do you like him?
F	CECILE	I don't know.
F	KATHRYN	Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
F	CECILE	I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him. What am I going to do? If my mother found out about Ronald she would kill me.
F	KATHRYN	Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
F	CECILE	Okay.
F	KATHRYN	Did you hide the letters?
F	CECILE	Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
F	KATHRYN	I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
F	CECILE	Why?
F	KATHRYN	Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
F	CECILE	You'd do that for me?
F	KATHRYN	Of course I would. We're friends, right?
F	CECILE	Best friends.
F	ANNETTE	Excuse me. Excuse me!
M	SEBASTIAN	You talking to me?
F	ANNETTE	Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
M	SEBASTIAN	What'cha reading?
F	ANNETTE	The Fountainhead.
M	SEBASTIAN	Great book.
F	ANNETTE	You've read The Fountainhead?
M	SEBASTIAN	Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
F	ANNETTE	Romantic? He rapes her.
M	SEBASTIAN	That's a matter of opinion.
F	ANNETTE	You need help.
M	SEBASTIAN	Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
F	ANNETTE	At this hour? I don't think so.
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
F	ANNETTE	Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
M	SEBASTIAN	Please.
F	ANNETTE	Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
M	SEBASTIAN	Thank you.
F	KATHRYN	Fuck her yet?
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm working on it.
F	KATHRYN	Loser.
M	SEBASTIAN	Blow me.
F	KATHRYN	Call me later.
M	SEBASTIAN	Okay.
F	KATHRYN	Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.
M	SOOK-HEE	Sorry.
F	KATHRYN	Oops.
F	ANNETTE	You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
M	SEBASTIAN	What? Another letter from your friend?
F	ANNETTE	This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
M	SEBASTIAN	You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
F	ANNETTE	I sincerely doubt it.
M	SEBASTIAN	Give me the fucking letter. Why did you do that?
F	ANNETTE	The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
M	SEBASTIAN	Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
F	ANNETTE	How's the water?
M	SEBASTIAN	Refreshing. You're right you know.
F	ANNETTE	About what?
M	SEBASTIAN	About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
F	ANNETTE	I never said that.
M	SEBASTIAN	You implied it.
F	ANNETTE	Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
M	SEBASTIAN	No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
F	ANNETTE	Thank you.
M	SEBASTIAN	Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
F	ANNETTE	Shut up.
M	SEBASTIAN	I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
F	ANNETTE	Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
M	SEBASTIAN	Why not?
F	ANNETTE	Because you act like a pig.
M	SEBASTIAN	Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
F	ANNETTE	I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
M	SEBASTIAN	You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
F	ANNETTE	I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
M	SEBASTIAN	Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
F	ANNETTE	You're naked.
M	SEBASTIAN	It's my house.
F	ANNETTE	That's repulsive.
M	SEBASTIAN	What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
F	ANNETTE	Get some manners.
M	SEBASTIAN	Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail Mary's for you. Good night.
M	GREG (O.S.)	Oh baby... oh baby...
M	SEBASTIAN	Baby? Right on time.
M	GREG	Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna...
M	SEBASTIAN	Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
M	GREG	Jesus!
M	SEBASTIAN	Greg, is that you under the covers?
M	GREG	Get out of here.
M	SEBASTIAN	Whoa!
M	GREG	I told you to lock the door.
M	BLAINE	I thought I did.
M	GREG	Look Valmont. This was the first time I've ever done something like this. I was --
M	SEBASTIAN	-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
M	GREG	Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
M	SEBASTIAN	Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
M	BLAINE	Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer.
M	GREG	Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything. Let's just forget the whole thing.
M	SEBASTIAN	Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you there. It's too good to pass up. After all, it is you who's bad- mouthing me to Annette Harrison.
M	GREG	Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
M	SEBASTIAN	Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
M	GREG	I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
M	BLAINE	I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
M	SEBASTIAN	Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	However, this whole incident's kind of turned me on. You get my point.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Jesus Christ, I was only kidding. What do you think, I'm gay? My God, haven't you had enough for tonight.
M	BLAINE	Our boy just can't get enough dick.
M	GREG	You sick son of a bitch.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'll leave you guys alone. Score one for the team, Greg. Come to think of it, there is something you can do for me.
M	SEBASTIAN	Need a lift?
F	ANNETTE	No thank you.
M	SEBASTIAN	How are you today?
F	ANNETTE	Give it up.
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
F	ANNETTE	I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
M	SEBASTIAN	I said I was sorry. Have a nice sleep last night?
F	ANNETTE	It was fine.
M	SEBASTIAN	I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
F	ANNETTE	I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
M	SEBASTIAN	Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
F	ANNETTE	And that's a bad thing?
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
F	ANNETTE	I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
F	ANNETTE	You don't even know me.
M	SEBASTIAN	Don't you believe in love at first sight?
F	ANNETTE	Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
M	SEBASTIAN	Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
F	ANNETTE	I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
M	SEBASTIAN	Who?
F	ANNETTE	That's none of your business.
M	SEBASTIAN	How about tonight?
F	ANNETTE	I'm busy.
M	SEBASTIAN	Doing what?
F	ANNETTE	That's also none of your business.
M	SEBASTIAN	Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
F	ANNETTE	You truly want to do something to make me happy?
M	SEBASTIAN	Yes.
F	ANNETTE	And you promise to abide by it?
M	SEBASTIAN	Without question.
F	ANNETTE	Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York.
M	SEBASTIAN	What?
F	ANNETTE	If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
F	ANNETTE	It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
M	GREG	He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
F	ANNETTE	Really? I thought he said it all the time.
M	GREG	That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth. What's wrong?
F	ANNETTE	Nothing.
M	GREG	Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
F	ANNETTE	No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
M	GREG	Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
F	ANNETTE	What do you mean?
M	GREG	Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
F	ANNETTE	I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
M	GREG	From who?
F	ANNETTE	I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
M	GREG	Annette, how long have we known each other?
F	ANNETTE	Forever.
M	GREG	Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
F	ANNETTE	You promise not to say anything?
M	GREG	On my mother's life.
F	ANNETTE	Okay...
M	SEBASTIAN	That nosey bitch. Are you sure?
M	GREG	Positive.
M	SEBASTIAN	Did you do everything I asked you to?
M	GREG	Yes.
M	SEBASTIAN	You told her I never said I love you before?
M	GREG	Yes!
M	SEBASTIAN	You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
M	GREG	Yes!
M	SEBASTIAN	And you think she bought it?
M	GREG	I'm pretty sure she did.
M	SEBASTIAN	Pretty sure or sure sure?
M	GREG	She bought it.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'll be in touch.
F	KATHRYN	Enough with the music. Fuck her already.
M	SEBASTIAN	You would not believe what--
F	KATHRYN	Shhh.
M	CECILE (ON VIDEO)	That was beautiful.
M	RONALD (ON VIDEO)	Almost as beautiful as you.
M	RONALD (ON VIDEO)	Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
M	CECILE (ON VIDEO)	I'll see you tomorrow.
M	RONALD (ON VIDEO)	Absolutely.
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	Idiot!
F	KATHRYN	What's wrong with you?
M	SEBASTIAN	You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
F	KATHRYN	Interesting.
M	SEBASTIAN	I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
F	KATHRYN	No.
M	SEBASTIAN	Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
F	KATHRYN	The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
M	SEBASTIAN	Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
F	KATHRYN	Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
M	SEBASTIAN	What's your plan of attack?
F	KATHRYN	I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
M	SEBASTIAN	But who will they turn to for help?
F	KATHRYN	Cecile is planning to go away with Court next week. I'll need you to speed up her sexual awakenings.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm at your service.
F	KATHRYN	Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh sis. You're so tense.
F	KATHRYN	I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
M	SEBASTIAN	I hate it too. Oh baby, your soaking.
F	KATHRYN	I know.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	Any luck with your girl?
M	SEBASTIAN	Moving along quite well.
F	KATHRYN	Have you succeeded in your task?
M	SEBASTIAN	Any day now.
F	KATHRYN	Well, let me know when you do. Until then. No pootie. Sorry.
M	SEBASTIAN	Goodbye Mister Bond.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Hi, it's Sebastian. I didn't wake you did I?
F	ANNETTE	No, not at all.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
F	ANNETTE	I'm... I'm alright.
M	SEBASTIAN	How was your date?
F	ANNETTE	It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
F	ANNETTE	Wait, don't hang up.
M	SEBASTIAN	Okay?
F	ANNETTE	What are you doing?
M	SEBASTIAN	Reading.
F	ANNETTE	What are you reading?
M	SEBASTIAN	Of Human Bondage.
F	ANNETTE	Somerset Maugham.
M	SEBASTIAN	Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
F	ANNETTE	You're not gonna start that again.
M	SEBASTIAN	No. I'm through with my childish games when it comes to you. Hold on, that's my other line. Rub. Annette that's my mom calling. Can I call you tomorrow?
F	ANNETTE	Sure. Have a good night.
M	SEBASTIAN	I will.
M	GRETCHEN	Of Human Bondage. You're such a bullshit artist.
M	SEBASTIAN	Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even know what it is.
M	GRETCHEN	Duh, it's a book.
M	SEBASTIAN	Do you know what it's about?
M	MORA	Who cares. Books are for fags.
M	SEBASTIAN	Books are for fags. I weep for the future.
M	SALESWOMAN	Here's something you might like.
F	KATHRYN	Do you carry any real fur?
M	SALESWOMAN	No. All our fur is faux.
F	KATHRYN	Of course. The animals. How silly of me.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	Fuck off.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	I got your message and came as quick as I could.
F	KATHRYN	I hope I didn't keep you from something.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Not at all. What's wrong?
F	KATHRYN	It's Cecile.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	What about her?
F	KATHRYN	Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
F	KATHRYN	It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Ronald? That's crazy.
F	KATHRYN	I know. She's so young and he's so -
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Black.
F	KATHRYN	He's been sending her love letters that she hides under her doll house. I questioned whether or not to tell you, but something like this could destroy her reputation at Oakwood and I don't want to see her get hurt.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	I hope I did the right thing in telling you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things with Court.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	I can't thank you enough.
F	KATHRYN	You will be discreet about this?
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Absolutely.
M	SALESWOMAN	Will that be cash or charge?
F	KATHRYN	Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Let me get that for you.
F	KATHRYN	Oh please. I can't have you do that.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	It's the least I can do.
F	KATHRYN	Thank you.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Who the hell do you think you are?!
M	RONALD	Excuse me.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
M	RONALD	Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Is that so?
M	MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)	You care to explain this then?
F	CECILE	Where did you find those?
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
F	CECILE	Those are my letters!
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now. Now! How dare you treat me with such disrespect. I got you off the streets and this is how you repay me?
M	RONALD	Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
M	RONALD	First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
M	RONALD	I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
M	RONALD	Took me off the streets?
M	RONALD	Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
M	SEBASTIAN	You're a lucky guy.
M	RONALD	She really loves me. What do I do?
F	KATHRYN	What do you do? Tell her you love her.
M	RONALD	But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
M	SEBASTIAN	Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
M	RONALD	How will I get to her?
M	SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN	We'll make sure she gets it.
M	RONALD	Why are you being so good to me?
F	KATHRYN	Because we want to see Cecile happy and we know you make her happy. Now you just march yourself into the study and start writing. We'll be there to check on you in a minute.
M	SEBASTIAN	Who are you calling?
F	KATHRYN	Cecile. What are you doing?
M	SEBASTIAN	Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
F	KATHRYN	I'm aware.
M	SEBASTIAN	Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
F	KATHRYN	What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience. Court Renolds is going down and if you're not going to help me, someone else will.
M	SEBASTIAN	You amaze me.
F	KATHRYN	Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day." I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out? Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright, stop crying. I understand. Hold on for Sebastian.
M	SEBASTIAN	Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me very carefully. I have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to you. Now I can't exactly bring it to your house, since your mother despises me so here's what we're going to do.
F	CECILE	Finished.
M	SEBASTIAN	Excellent.
F	CECILE	You think he'll like it?
M	SEBASTIAN	He'll love it.
F	CECILE	What are you doing?
M	SEBASTIAN	Just taking your photo.
F	CECILE	I look terrible.
M	SEBASTIAN	Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
F	CECILE	I'm getting out of here.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm sorry that was out of line.
F	CECILE	I want to go home.
M	SEBASTIAN	I was just kidding.
F	CECILE	I want to go home.
M	SEBASTIAN	Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
F	CECILE	My mom? Don't call my mom.
M	SEBASTIAN	Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
F	CECILE	Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
M	SEBASTIAN	Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
F	CECILE	And then I can go home?
M	SEBASTIAN	Of course. I'm not a monster.
F	CECILE	Just a kiss, right?
M	SEBASTIAN	I swear.
F	CECILE	What are you doing?
M	SEBASTIAN	You promised to let me kiss you.
F	CECILE	But -
M	SEBASTIAN	I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to be late for the -
M	MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)	Cecile? Cecile?
M	CECILE (O.S.)	I'm in the bath, mom.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
M	CECILE (O.S.)	Okay.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	It was nice of you to invite us up for the weekend, Helen.
M	AUNT HELEN	More the merrier. Is everything alright my dear?
F	CECILE	I'm just not feeling well.
M	SEBASTIAN	Afternoon ladies.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	I didn't know you'd be here, Sebastian.
M	SEBASTIAN	I wasn't planning on it, but being such a lovely day, why waste it in the city. Anyone for tennis? What's wrong with her?
M	MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)	Would you excuse me for a minute?
M	SEBASTIAN	I hope she's alright.
M	AUNT HELEN	I better go check on them.
M	SEBASTIAN	Alone again. What are you up to today?
F	ANNETTE	I'm doing some volunteer work.
M	SEBASTIAN	Need any company?
F	ANNETTE	You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
M	SEBASTIAN	I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
F	ANNETTE	Okay.
M	SEBASTIAN	Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
F	CECILE	Please. I need you. I don't know what to do. You're the only one I can talk to.
F	KATHRYN	I'll be there in a few hours.
M	NURSE	It's really nice when the young people help out. Most of our patients don't have any family nearby.
M	NURSE (cont'd)	Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for you. Actually Sebastian, you're going to be spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman.
M	MRS. SUGERMAN	Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
M	SEBASTIAN	Yes, you already did.
M	MRS. SUGERMAN	I did?
M	SEBASTIAN	Right after we played backgammon.
M	MRS. SUGERMAN	We played backgammon?
M	SEBASTIAN	Uh huh. You beat me three times.
M	MRS. SUGERMAN	I did?
M	SEBASTIAN	Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
M	MRS. SUGERMAN	Excuse me?
M	SEBASTIAN	I said, do you want some water?
M	MRS. SUGERMAN	Oh... no thank you...
M	SEBASTIAN	Come in.
M	NURSE	How we doing in here?
M	MRS. SUGERMAN	I won three games of backgammon.
M	SEBASTIAN	It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
F	ANNETTE	Oh please.
M	SEBASTIAN	What?
F	ANNETTE	"I actually feel good about myself?"
M	SEBASTIAN	I do.
F	ANNETTE	You must take me for a real idiot.
M	SEBASTIAN	I don't.
F	ANNETTE	You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
M	SEBASTIAN	I did. We played three games of backgammon and... Alright. I was bored out of my fucking mind. I hate doing charity.
F	ANNETTE	That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
M	SEBASTIAN	Yes it does.
F	ANNETTE	No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
M	SEBASTIAN	I can't win with you.
F	ANNETTE	It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
M	SEBASTIAN	I do not.
F	ANNETTE	Lighten up.
M	SEBASTIAN	I am lighten. Can we drop this?
F	ANNETTE	Fine.
M	SEBASTIAN	What are you doing? Stop it, it's distracting.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Cut it out.
F	ANNETTE	Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
M	SEBASTIAN	No.
F	ANNETTE	No?
M	SEBASTIAN	Stop that.
F	ANNETTE	There's hope for you, yet.
F	CECILE	Who is it?
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	It's Kathryn.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	Are you okay?
F	CECILE	No.
F	KATHRYN	Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
F	CECILE	Something awful happened last night.
F	KATHRYN	What do you mean?!
F	CECILE	I... I don't think you want to know.
F	KATHRYN	Cecile, you have to tell me.
F	CECILE	It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
F	KATHRYN	Does your mother know?
F	CECILE	If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
F	KATHRYN	Why didn't you do something?
F	CECILE	I don't know.
F	KATHRYN	So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
F	CECILE	Well... not exactly.
F	KATHRYN	He made you give him a blow job.
F	CECILE	No.
F	KATHRYN	Well what then? He ate you out?
F	CECILE	If that's what you call it.
F	KATHRYN	Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
F	CECILE	What do I do then?
F	KATHRYN	Well did you like it?
F	CECILE	Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
F	KATHRYN	Cecile, you had an orgasm.
F	CECILE	I did?
F	KATHRYN	I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
F	CECILE	I am?
F	KATHRYN	Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
F	CECILE	I don't love him. I love Ronald.
F	KATHRYN	So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
F	CECILE	But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
F	KATHRYN	Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
F	CECILE	It's like a secret society.
F	KATHRYN	That's one way of looking at it.
F	CECILE	Cool.
F	KATHRYN	I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
M	SEBASTIAN	Yippy.
F	KATHRYN	Who are you spying on?
M	SEBASTIAN	Take a look for yourself.
F	KATHRYN	That her?
M	SEBASTIAN	Yeah.
F	KATHRYN	Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
M	SEBASTIAN	Shut up.
F	KATHRYN	What's your problem?
M	SEBASTIAN	Nothing.
F	KATHRYN	She's really getting to you, isn't she?
M	SEBASTIAN	If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh.
F	KATHRYN	And that's why you're losing your bet?
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
F	KATHRYN	Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
M	SEBASTIAN	Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
M	SEBASTIAN	Am I bothering you?
F	ANNETTE	Not at all. Have a seat.
M	SEBASTIAN	Don't tell me you finished The Fountainhead already? Great book. What's the guy's name, Florentino...
F	ANNETTE	Florentino Ariza.
M	SEBASTIAN	My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
F	ANNETTE	Who's Monsieur Philipe?
M	SEBASTIAN	You don't know Monsieur Philipe? Bonjour mademoiselle.
F	ANNETTE	Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
M	SEBASTIAN	You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Oooo, that felt good.
F	ANNETTE	Thank you.
M	SEBASTIAN	That felt good too. I will kiss you all over.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	I'm sorry about that.
F	ANNETTE	I am too.
M	SEBASTIAN	You know what? I don't take it back.
F	ANNETTE	Why are you doing this?
M	SEBASTIAN	Because I'm in love with you.
F	ANNETTE	I thought you said we were going to be friends.
M	SEBASTIAN	I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
F	ANNETTE	I have feelings for you.
M	SEBASTIAN	Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
F	ANNETTE	That's not fair.
M	SEBASTIAN	Why can't we be together?
F	ANNETTE	You really want to know?
M	SEBASTIAN	Yes.
F	ANNETTE	It's because I don't trust myself with you. I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
M	SEBASTIAN	Shit.
F	CECILE	Want to join me?
M	SEBASTIAN	Some other time, Cecile. What am I, an idiot?
F	CECILE	Am I suppose to be this sore?
M	SEBASTIAN	For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
F	CECILE	I like it better when I'm on top.
M	SEBASTIAN	Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
F	CECILE	I'm sorry.
M	CECILE (cont'd)	Something's bothering you?
M	SEBASTIAN	You think?
F	CECILE	Is it me?
M	SEBASTIAN	No, you were fine.
F	CECILE	It's that girl, Annette. You love her, don't you? It's okay. I don't love you either. I love Ronald.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm getting out of here.
F	CECILE	Where are you going?
M	SEBASTIAN (O.S.)	I'm taking a shower.
F	CECILE	Need any company?
M	SEBASTIAN (O.S.)	No.
F	CECILE	Want a blow job?
M	SEBASTIAN (O.S.)	Good night Cecile.
F	CECILE	Prude.
F	ANNETTE	Come in.
M	SEBASTIAN	I just came to say goodbye.
F	ANNETTE	Where are you going?
M	SEBASTIAN	Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
F	ANNETTE	I think that's for the best.
M	SEBASTIAN	Good for you.
F	ANNETTE	Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
F	ANNETTE	How am I a hypocrite?
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite. Have a nice life.
F	ANNETTE	Please don't go.
M	SEBASTIAN	Get off me.
F	ANNETTE	I... I want you.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm sorry, I can't.
M	SEBASTIAN	Shit. Get it together you pussy.
F	KATHRYN	Morning!
M	SEBASTIAN	Morning.
F	KATHRYN	So? How'd it go last night?
M	SEBASTIAN	With who?
F	KATHRYN	Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
M	SEBASTIAN	If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
F	KATHRYN	She shot you down.
M	SEBASTIAN	Exactly the opposite.
F	KATHRYN	So what went wrong?
M	SEBASTIAN	I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
F	KATHRYN	You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
M	SEBASTIAN	A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
F	KATHRYN	If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
M	SEBASTIAN	Where is she?
F	KATHRYN	You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.
M	SEBASTIAN	Where'd she go?
F	KATHRYN	She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
M	SEBASTIAN	We'll see about that.
M	GREG	Hello.
M	SEBASTIAN	Is she with you?
M	GREG	Who is this?
M	SEBASTIAN	Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
M	GREG	No.
M	SEBASTIAN	Where is she?!
M	GREG	I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
M	SEBASTIAN	McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
M	GREG	I told you I don't know.
M	SEBASTIAN	One.
M	GREG	Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
M	SEBASTIAN	Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Motherfucker.
M	SEBASTIAN	Ooops. Fuck this. Suave.
F	ANNETTE	Hi.
M	SEBASTIAN	Hi.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	You alright?
F	ANNETTE	I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. Was it --
M	SEBASTIAN	It was perfect.
M	SEBASTIAN	You work way to hard. Here. Take the day off. Merry Christmas.
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	Slower.
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	A little to the left. Look, pretend like you're writing the alphabet. A... B... mmm, stay on B.
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	One second.
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	Come in.
M	SEBASTIAN	Bad time?
F	KATHRYN	Kind of.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	Who is our little friend so inexperienced that you have to resort to the alphabet game? Well, well, well.
M	RONALD	It's not what it seems like.
M	SEBASTIAN	Say hi to Cecile.
F	KATHRYN	Call me.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	You can't have all the fun.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	You seem to be in a good mood.
M	SEBASTIAN	I am.
F	KATHRYN	You didn't?
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh yes.
F	KATHRYN	Tell me all the details.
M	SEBASTIAN	It was... Fantastic.
F	KATHRYN	Oh come on. For her first time?
M	SEBASTIAN	I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
F	KATHRYN	No, tell me.
M	SEBASTIAN	It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
F	KATHRYN	Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
M	SEBASTIAN	Mock, mock, mock.
F	KATHRYN	So I assume you've come here to make some arrangements.
M	SEBASTIAN	Some other time.
F	KATHRYN	Excuse me?
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm not in the mood.
F	KATHRYN	And that's why you're leaving?
M	SEBASTIAN	It clearly is why.
F	KATHRYN	I want to fuck.
M	SEBASTIAN	And I don't.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'll pick you up in an hour. I love you too.
F	KATHRYN	Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
M	SEBASTIAN	No, I'm not.
F	KATHRYN	P-whipped, p-whipped.
M	SEBASTIAN	What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
F	KATHRYN	I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
M	SEBASTIAN	Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
F	KATHRYN	At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
M	SEBASTIAN	Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
F	KATHRYN	Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
M	SEBASTIAN	I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
F	KATHRYN	Is that what you think? Alright, come on, let's get it over with. But mark my words, this is the only time it'll happen.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in me. While you're doing that I'm gonna make some phone calls.
M	SEBASTIAN	That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
F	KATHRYN	Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away. Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but now he's just another love-struck faggot. One of the many.
F	KATHRYN	Why so nervous?
M	SEBASTIAN	I've never done this before.
F	KATHRYN	How have you dumped girls in the past?
M	SEBASTIAN	Screening calls. Any suggestions?
F	KATHRYN	I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." Poor fatty never had a chance.
F	KATHRYN	Don't be weak.
M	SEBASTIAN	Hi. Is Annette at home?
M	MRS. O'SHEA	You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you. Annette. Come on in.
F	ANNETTE	Hi.
M	SEBASTIAN	Hi.
M	MRS. O'SHEA	Well, I'm going to head back to the kitchen. You two have fun.
F	ANNETTE	Would you like a tour?
M	SEBASTIAN	Sure.
F	ANNETTE	And this is my room. You think we can be quiet?
M	SEBASTIAN	This isn't working out for me anymore.
F	ANNETTE	Yeah, me neither. What's wrong?
M	SEBASTIAN	It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
F	ANNETTE	What are you saying?
M	SEBASTIAN	Why aren't you understanding?
F	ANNETTE	I love you.
M	SEBASTIAN	I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
F	ANNETTE	Why are you trying to hurt me?
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed. Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea would appreciate you acting like a total psychopath.
F	ANNETTE	You don't know how to love.
M	SEBASTIAN	You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
F	ANNETTE	But you knew this was important to me.
M	SEBASTIAN	What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
F	ANNETTE	Please go.
M	SEBASTIAN	Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.
F	KATHRYN	Jesus.
F	KATHRYN	A little melodramatic, don't you think.
M	SEBASTIAN	I have a flair for drama.
F	KATHRYN	Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
M	SEBASTIAN	You wanted an answer to your question.
F	KATHRYN	Annette?
M	SEBASTIAN	Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
F	KATHRYN	Well done.
M	SEBASTIAN	I thought we should celebrate.
F	KATHRYN	I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
M	SEBASTIAN	Ronald?
F	KATHRYN	Not that it's any of your business but yes.
M	SEBASTIAN	From Ronald.
M	SEBASTIAN (cont'd)	I haven't had a chance to read it, but I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me. Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." You see, I expected your sort of bullshit so I took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile over you, but I promised him I would see you through your crisis.
F	KATHRYN	Well done.
M	SEBASTIAN	Thank you. Now, where were we? Oh yeah, the celebration. What shall we toast to?
F	KATHRYN	To my triumph, of course.
M	SEBASTIAN	Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette. What's so funny?
F	KATHRYN	Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
M	SEBASTIAN	Come again?
F	KATHRYN	You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Cheers.
M	SEBASTIAN	In any event, you still owe me my reward.
F	KATHRYN	I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	You motherfucker! Nobody hits me.
M	SEBASTIAN	Calm down.
F	KATHRYN	Get off me!
M	SEBASTIAN	Will you calm down?
F	KATHRYN	Fine! Get off me!
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
F	KATHRYN	I accept. Now get out.
M	SEBASTIAN	Get out? We had an arrangement.
F	KATHRYN	Didn't you hear what I said?
M	SEBASTIAN	I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
F	KATHRYN	Get out!
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
F	KATHRYN	And if I don't?
M	SEBASTIAN	Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
F	KATHRYN	I think you have your answer.
M	SEBASTIAN	War it is.
M	SEBASTIAN	It's desperate that I talk to her.
M	MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)	I've already told you, she's not home.
M	SEBASTIAN	Well please leave a message that I called. I'll do that.
M	SEBASTIAN	Shit.
M	MRS. O'SHEA	What do you want?
M	SEBASTIAN	I need to talk to Annette.
M	MRS. O'SHEA	She's not here.
M	SEBASTIAN	Do you know where she is?
M	MRS. O'SHEA	She's out.
M	SEBASTIAN	Do you know when she'll be back?
M	MRS. O'SHEA	Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
M	SEBASTIAN	Annette! Annette!
M	MRS. O'SHEA	Young man, I already told you she's not here.
M	SEBASTIAN	Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
M	MRS. O'SHEA	I'll do that.
M	SEBASTIAN	It's really important.
M	MRS. O'SHEA	I understand. Good night.
M	RONALD	Hello.
F	KATHRYN	Ronald?
M	RONALD	Yeah?
F	KATHRYN	It's Kathryn.
M	RONALD	Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
F	KATHRYN	No.
M	RONALD	What's wrong?
F	KATHRYN	It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
M	RONALD	What do you mean?
F	KATHRYN	I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
M	RONALD	I'll be right there.
M	SEBASTIAN (V.O.)	Dear Annette. Thank you for reading this letter. I don't know what I can possibly say to rectify the harm I have caused you. For once in my life I'm at a loss for words.
M	SEBASTIAN (V.O.)	The truth of the matter is that being with you was the only time I have ever been happy. My whole life has been a joke. I prided myself on taking joy in others' misery.
M	SEBASTIAN (V.O.)	Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded in hurting the first person I loved. I wish more than anything I could take it back, but I guess that's not possible.
M	SEBASTIAN (V.O.)	Enclosed is my most prized possession... my journal. For a long time I considered it my trophy. A sordid collection of my conquests. If you really want to know the truth, then please read it. No more lies. A car is picking me up tomorrow and taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where we have a summer home. Nothing would make me happier than if you joined me. I'm a fucking wreck without you. If you're interested please meet me outside my building at nine. If not, I understand. Love, Sebastian.
F	KATHRYN	And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
M	RONALD	And this happened before you and I hooked up?
F	KATHRYN	It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
M	RONALD	Racist piece of shit.
F	KATHRYN	I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
M	RONALD	He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
F	KATHRYN	Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
M	RONALD	Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
F	KATHRYN	Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.
M	SEBASTIAN	What time is it?
M	NIGHT DOORMAN	Eight o'clock. You got to go.
M	SEBASTIAN	Did she show up?
M	NIGHT DOORMAN	Nope.
M	SEBASTIAN	Do you mind if I check upstairs?
M	NIGHT DOORMAN	I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
M	SEBASTIAN	I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
M	NIGHT DOORMAN	Don't worry about it.
M	RONALD	Son of a bitch. Sebastian!
M	SEBASTIAN	Hey Ronald.
M	RONALD	It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
M	SEBASTIAN	Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and - What's your problem?
M	RONALD	Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
M	SEBASTIAN	What are you talking about?
M	RONALD	Kathryn. Did you hit her?
M	SEBASTIAN	Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
M	RONALD	Did you hit her?
M	SEBASTIAN	Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
M	RONALD	Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile. It's true, isn't it?
M	SEBASTIAN	Ronald, I'm sorry.
M	RONALD	You bastard! I trusted you! I trusted you!
M	SEBASTIAN	Fuck you. Why don't you give me a chance to explain. Don't you get it? We were all part of her game. I'm gonna let you up, but you have to give me a chance to explain. Understood? Annette!
F	ANNETTE	Sebastian!
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm okay. I'm okay.
F	ANNETTE	Get an ambulance! We're getting you to a hospital.
M	SEBASTIAN	Holy shit. You're gonna be fine.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm sorry. It's alright.
M	SEBASTIAN	I'm okay. Everything's good.
F	MRS. CALDWELL	Sad, sad, sad. To think of the opportunities that boy had. This should be a lesson to us all that our children need constant supervision.
M	MRS. CALDWELL (CONT'D)	It's all about quality time.
M	KATHRYN (O.S.)	He loved that view.
F	ANNETTE	I can see why.
F	KATHRYN	I'm Kathryn.
F	ANNETTE	Annette Harrison.
F	KATHRYN	Have we met?
F	ANNETTE	I don't think so.
F	KATHRYN	Did you know Sebastian well?
F	ANNETTE	You might say that.
F	KATHRYN	Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
F	ANNETTE	That's right.
F	KATHRYN	I'm sure you're going to love it there.
F	KATHRYN	Are you okay?
F	ANNETTE	I'll be fine.
F	KATHRYN	Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
M	KATHRYN (cont'd)	You sure you're going to be alright? I'm here if you need a friend.
F	ANNETTE	Thank you.
F	KATHRYN	Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I... turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
F	ANNETTE	Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
F	KATHRYN	Excuse me?
F	ANNETTE	You heard me.
F	KATHRYN	Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
F	ANNETTE	Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
F	KATHRYN	Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
F	ANNETTE	I have his journal.
F	KATHRYN	You what?
F	ANNETTE	His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
F	KATHRYN	You didn't show it to anybody?
F	ANNETTE	Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
F	KATHRYN	You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
F	ANNETTE	I know.
M	ANNETTE (cont'd)	Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you once say that crying is a sign of weakness? I'm very disappointed in you. Alright, stop crying. There's a bright side to this you know. You're going to be my pet project next year. You're going to do what I tell you to do, wear what I tell you to wear. You're going to befriend the unpopular, sleep with the insecure. Think of the social ramifications it will cause. You and I are going to turn this school around. And do you know why you're going to do it? Cause your ass is mine. We'll be in touch. Forgot something.
