M	ADAM (CONT'D).	Someone told me recently that I look like Richard Nixon when I Gum. Adam does a little- imitation of what that looks. like. Emma
M	ADAM (CONT'D)	And it suddenly became clear why none of my girlfriends ever wanted to have sex with me. I thought it was just because my dick was too big and it scared them-But apparently-that's not the problem. At all. Actually, I've heard it's like acupuncture- you're- on your back the whole time and you don't even feel it go in. That's what my ex-girlfriend told me before she started dating my father. Vanessa and Alvin laugh, Vanessa covers her head with-her

M	ADAM	Emma, you can't just call me and tell me that now everything's different, now, you love me, now you, want to be.my girlfriend- after I spent-months trying to get over you somehow, trying to tell myselfto forget-you- you can't just .call me and, expect me to just come running- which I did, I know, but I can't just jump back in, I can't just start over, all of a sudden.
F	EMMA	I know.. It doesn't- work that way.. I . get i.t . They look at each other, at a loss.
M	ADAM	Maybe-we just-'I don't know, maybe we blew it. Maybe ' our.'timing was
F	EMMA	.Maybe, but maybe that's just the way. it. happened. Maybe we were just growing up. But I'm in love with you.
M	EMMA (CONT'D)	I want to write it on myforehead, t want to buy a t-shirt that's says: "I love.Adam Kurtzman" and wear it around all day long. What do you want me to do?.
M	ADAM	I don't know.
M	E	why did we waste so much time pretending like we didn't.care?.
F	EMMA	I want that time back. I want to break all those rules. I want to try this. Let's try. I don't think I can do'it again.
M	EMMA.	Yeah. Okay.
M	ADAM	But we should still, you know, see
M	.EMMA	Come on. We don't 'have to break up, we never even started. You're going to be so great.

M	MAN	Hey, Adam, get in here- Adam. runs back to the building.
M	ADAM	Don't go anywhere, okay Emma watches h:im - go. She gets in her car, closes the door. Are.youstill working? I'll meet you outside.
M	ADAM!	Is everyone gone?
M	ALVIN	.Vanessa went home to walk the dog.. We- have: a dog now. She named it Freckle. I don't know what to do about that. I might kill it. I don't know yet., Only time will tell. Hey;-let's pretend I'm a good dad. and you tell me what the hell's wrong with you and then I take you. fishing.
M	ADAM,	I'm completely in -love with someone, and I'm brainstorming ways that I can never see her again without ruining my life.',
M	ALVIN	How'd.you get so screwed up? Oh yeah.-I did it.
M	ADAM	I'm just like you- I'm going to fuck it all up. Like you. -Like you gave up on Mom.
M	ALVIN	When ' we -first , had you, we hadn't slept in days, we were just shoving' food in our mouths over the sink whenever we could. And finally, I got it together enough to get. some take-out from one of the -restaurants we used to like.
M	ALVIN (CONT'D)	And I set it all out on,the table, and the second we sat down, I think it was the first bite I took, you started crying. And your Horn and I looked at each-other-and just
M	STARTED-LAUGHING- LIKE	uncontrollably laughing., We're on the floor, we can't breathe.. that kind of laughing. I'm pretty sure that was the best of moment of my life'. If, you rre not Counting anything with a blowjob.
M	ADAM.	So why'd-you start dicking around?'. Why'd you leave her?
M	ALVIN	I don't know. I-think the. simplest answer is: I'm a jerk. And--the. other answer is: Because - at -some point, we forgot how to make each other laugh.. And if that-sounds like a bullshit answer, you're probably right. But if it 'sounds really deep, then - that-'s, good too. Alto.-just FYI- the first time I cheated .oft.' your mom, I. was on a lot of blow. So. if you're married and you. do blow, try to avoid-being -around women who wantto_fuck.you. Even fat women. Blow is-blind, Adam, blow is blind. You're an asshole.
M	ALVIN	But you're not. Call her.
M	ADAM	Don't tell me what to do. (a beat, smiles). I'm going to. call her.
