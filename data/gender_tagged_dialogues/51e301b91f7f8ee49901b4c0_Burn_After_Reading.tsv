M	PALMER	Yeah, that's right. Oz, look. There's no easy way to say this. We're taking you off the Balkans desk.
M	OSBOURNE	You're----what? Why?
M	PALMER	In fact we're moving you out of Sigint entirely.
M	OSBOURNE	...What? No discussion, just----you're out?
M	PALMER	Well, we're having the discussion now Oz. This doesn't have to be unpleasant.
M	OSBOURNE	Palmer, with all due respect----what the fuck are you talking about? ... And why is Olson here?
M	PALMER	... Look, Ozzie----
M	OSBOURNE	What the fuck is this?! Is it my----I know it's not my work.
M	PALMER	Ozzie----
M	OSBOURNE	I'm a great fucking analyst! Is it----
M	PALMER	Oz, things are not going well. As you know.
M	PECK	You have a drinking problem.
M	OSBOURNE	I have a drinking problem.
M	PALMER	This doesn't have to be unpleasant. We found you something in State. It's a, uh... ... It's a lower clearance level. Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're not terminating you.
M	OSBOURNE	This is an assault.
M	PECK	Come on, Ozzie.
M	OSBOURNE	This is an assault. I have a drinking problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon!
M	PECK	Ozzie----
M	OSBOURNE	Next to you we all have a drinking problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass didn't I kiss? Let's be honest!
M	PALMER	Okay, Olson----
M	OSBOURNE	Let's be fucking honest... ... This is a crucifixion! This is political! Don't tell me it's not!
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... I have a drinking problem!
F	KATIE	You're home.
M	OSBOURNE	Hang on to your hat, honey. I have some news. I----
F	KATIE	Did you pick up the cheeses?
M	OSBOURNE	Huh?
F	KATIE	Were they ready? I didn't know you were coming home this early.
M	OSBOURNE	The cheeses.
F	KATIE	I left a message for you to stop at Todaro's. The Magruders and the Pfarrers are coming over.
M	OSBOURNE	The Pfarrers? Ugh. I----what did Kathleen say?
F	KATIE	What?
M	OSBOURNE	When you left the message?
F	KATIE	She said. She would give you. The message.
M	OSBOURNE	Well she, I don't know, I guess we had bigger news today. My day didn't revolve arou----
F	KATIE	So you didn't get the cheeses.
M	OSBOURNE	Well, since I didn't get the message, no, I didn't get the cheeses. But hang on to your hat, I----
F	KATIE	Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I have to go out again? All right, well, you better get dressed.
M	OSBOURNE	Honey, we have to talk.
F	KATIE	Not right now. They'll be here in, what, less than an hour.
M	VOICE	Is this a, uh, goat cheese?
M	OSBOURNE (OFF)	Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese.
M	HARRY	Because I have lactose reflux. But I can----
M	OSBOURNE	You're lactose intolerant?
M	HARRY	Yes, but I can----
M	OSBOURNE	Or you have acid reflux? They're two different things.
M	HARRY	I know what they are.
M	OSBOURNE	Then you misspoke yourself. So I----
M	HARRY	Thank you for correcting me.
F	KATIE	You should try the chevre, Harry. It's very good.
M	HARRY	Yeah. I can eat goat cheese.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... I was just explaining to your husband here, I have a condition----
F	KATIE	Harry works with the Marshalls' * Service. *
M	DOUG MAGRUDER	I'm on the legislative side, I * with Senator Hobby. * Used to work for Treasury, but I * didn't go over to Homeland Security. * I'm with the Marshalls. *
M	OSBOURNE	If you want he'll show you his great big gun.
M	HARRY	Very amusing. The gun is actually no big deal. Twenty years in the marshall's service and I've never discharged my weapon.
M	OSBOURNE	Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist.
M	HARRY	What? I don't have a psychiatrist.
M	DOUG MAGRUDER	Boy, I guess my job is pretty undramatic. I'm on the legislative side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do you also carry a gun?
M	HARRY	Sandy writes children's books.
F	SANDY	I write children's books----
M	HARRY	Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who----
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	...Who Lives In The Rotunda. Excuse me.
M	TINA	Those are wonderful! My nieces and nephews----
M	HARRY	Yeah, it's a beloved series. You wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh. Are you sure this is goat cheese?
F	KATIE	Why don't you let your wife tell them about her own books, Harry?
M	HARRY	I'm sorry----was I----
F	KATIE	Here, come in the kitchen, help me with the crudités.
M	HARRY	Goddamnit. He knows, doesn't he.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... Nice floors.
F	KATIE	Knows what?
M	HARRY	About us, he knows about us. Little prick.
F	KATIE	Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a thing.
M	HARRY	What is that, forbo?
M	HARRY	What a horse's ass.
F	SANDY	I don't know why we see them.
M	HARRY	Well, she's all right.
F	SANDY	She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.
F	KATIE	You quit?!
M	OSBOURNE	Uh-huh.
F	KATIE	Well----Thank you for letting me know!
M	OSBOURNE	I tried to tell you this afternoon.
F	KATIE	You tried? You tried? And then---- what, the aphasia kicked in?
M	OSBOURNE	Our guests came. We----
F	KATIE	For fuck's sake, Ozzie!
M	OSBOURNE	just----I don't know. I got so
F	KATIE	tired.
M	OSBOURNE	of swimming against the current.
F	KATIE	
M	OSBOURNE	thought is not only not there, they resist it, they it, the bureaucracy is
F	KATIE	you get a pension, or severance or or----
M	OSBOURNE	didn't retire you know, I, I quit. don't want their benefits.
F	KATIE	I suppose my benefits are all I suppose you can live with is that the idea?
M	OSBOURNE	not like that's the only way to money.
F	KATIE	Yes? What're you gonna do?
M	OSBOURNE	do some consulting.
F	KATIE	
M	OSBOURNE	to help while I----I've always to write.
F	KATIE	Write what.
M	OSBOURNE	I've been thinking about it. A book, a sort of, sort of memoir.
M	OSBOURNE	You okay there, Dad?
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... Dad, I left my job at the Agency...
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad, government service is not what it was when you were in State. Things are different now. I don't know, maybe it's... it's... the Cold War ending; now it seems like it's all bureaucracy and no mission...
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... I'm writing a memoir. I think it's going to be pretty explosive. But I don't think you'll disapprove. I don't think you'll disapprove. Katie has had trouble accepting it. But... sometimes there's a higher patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes, change is hard. It's hard on Katie. But we'll be okay. We'll be okay. Life is change. This is good. We were all blocked up, Katie and me. This is, this is a blessing in disguise. I'll go into training, you know. Lay off the sauce. Like you did. You managed to do it. Finally. And then I can concentrate on, you know. New beginning. And this'll all have been for the best. Don't you think Dad? ... Cold.
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... I guess we should head back.
M	A MAN'S VOICE	We've seen this...
M	TERIKHIAN	... I know this kind of man. We've seen this. ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man take advantage of you. And he will. He will.
F	KATIE	Yes. This is my fear. He's trying---- he says----he's trying to pull himself together, but...
M	TERIKHIAN	Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things. And you should. People turn themselves around. Not unheard-of. But. You---- you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet?
F	KATIE	No.
M	TERIKHIAN	Well that's good. Because first you should get all his financials. Before he's forewarned. Because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances. Paper files, computer files, whatever----this is your prerogative. You can be a spy too, madam. Do this before you put him on alert. Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh...
M	TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)	... Feet. ... And hopefully everything will work out. He will reform. But! If not: forewarned is forearmed.
M	OSBOURNE	We were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do. We thought of the Agency less as... less as...
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... The principles of George Kennan----a personal hero of mine----were what animated us. In fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service. Like the State Department's China Hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a different venue, in a different medium, in, um... "Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in a different----
M	MACHINE	You have reached The Cox Group...
M	MACHINE (CONT'D)	... We can't answer your call right now. Please leave a----
M	OSBOURNE	Hello. ... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her number... No, upstairs...No she's not, but leave it on her machine.
M	OSBOURNE	Single...
M	HARRY	I should try to get a run in.
F	KATIE	Ozzie! dinner. See you later.
M	VOICES	Tune every heart and every voice...
M	MEN	... Bid every care withdraw. Let all with one accord rejoice...
M	MEN (CONT'D)	... In praise of Old Nassau...
M	MEN (CONT'D)	... In praise of Old Nassau my boys, Hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah!
M	MEN (CONT'D)	... Her sons... shall give... while they... shall live...
M	MEN (CONT'D)	... In praise of Old Nassau!
M	DOCTOR (OFF)	We take all the chicken fat off your buttocks, here... and here... And the upper arms. And a little off your tummy... ...And we do breast augmentation with a tiny incision here... and here. Uh-huh. And what about the thigh area?
M	DOCTOR	Well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise. Buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises.
M	PATIENT	Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my arms til the cows come home, but...
M	DOCTOR	Uh-huh. And of course there are also genetic factors.
M	PATIENT	The Litzkes are big.
M	DOCTOR	Uh-huh, well everything's----
M	PATIENT	My mom had an ass that could pull a bus.
M	DOCTOR	Wow. Well that's a predispo----
M	PATIENT	Father's side too, although Dad tends to carry his weight in front of him.
M	DOCTOR	Uh-huh.
M	PATIENT	In the gut area. Derriere, not so much.
M	DOCTOR	Okay.
F	LINDA	And what about the face, you know, the window to the soul.
M	DOCTOR	Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Very well put. Well your eyes are one of your best features. But we can do something about the incipient crow's feet.
F	LINDA	Baby crow's feet. Little chickling's feet. I mean chicks. Chickie chickie chickie.
M	DOCTOR	Ha-ha, yes, again, well put. You have a way with words. We cut here...
M	DOCTOR (CONT'D)	... And we pull the skin tight, like stretching the skin over a drum. Not too tight, though. We don't want that "worked-on" look. You need sufficient slack for the face to remain expressive.
F	LINDA	Yeah, I don't wanna look like Boris Karloff.
M	DOCTOR	Uh-huh! Heh-heh, so you don't want a sex change!
F	LINDA	No, I'm all woman!
M	DOCTOR	So Linda, what we're talking about here is four different procedures. The liposuction... The rhinoplasty... The facial tuck, which I would strongly recommend over the chemical peel----
F	LINDA	Yeah, I don't want to get anything burned off.
M	DOCTOR	And why should you. With that lovely skin. And lastly, the breast augmentation. Now we can also do something about the vaccine scar----I don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much----
F	LINDA	Not with these ham hocks!
M	DOCTOR	Yes, well once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you----
F	LINDA	Well I don't know. Is the vaccine thing----can you counsel me on this? I don't know, is it unsightly? I see it a lot, a bunch of people have it.
M	DOCTOR	Absolutely! Some women don't mind it at all! Personal taste!
F	LINDA	Chad!
M	PATRON	Ow!
M	CHAD	I'm sorry, was that too much?
M	PATRON	I felt a straining... a tightness in the... in the front of my ass...
M	CHAD	Well you're pretty tight. You have to feel it or----
F	LINDA	Chad Feldheimer. Office.
M	CHAD	I'll be back in a minute. We'll work on opening those hips.
F	LINDA	I got a batch from BeWithMeDC dot com.
M	CHAD	Oh wow. Any good?
F	LINDA	I don't know yet, just looking... How do you open this?
M	CHAD	Click on, uh... yeah...
F	LINDA	Oh my god!
M	CHAD	What?
F	LINDA	Oh my God, what a loser! ... Loser! Loser!... What is this! They call this Mr. Saggy dot com.
M	CHAD	
F	LINDA	
M	CHAD	you have to send a picture?
F	LINDA	only guys do. I submitted a profile, turn-ons, turn-offs, cetera. I'm really looking for with a sense of humor.
M	CHAD	guy----wait----that guy wasn't bad.
F	LINDA	
M	CHAD	before.
F	LINDA	
M	CHAD	He uh, he might not be a loser.
F	LINDA	can you tell?
M	CHAD	a Brioni suit.
F	LINDA	yeah?
M	CHAD	yeah.
F	LINDA	he look like he has a sense of
M	CHAD	looks like his optometrist has a of humor. ... Huh-huh-huh. What does he do?
F	LINDA	State Department.
M	CHAD	That's cool.
F	LINDA	His hair is... what is that?
M	CHAD	Plugs.
F	LINDA	This is the cardio area. A lot of machines here so that, believe me, there's never a wait. What you're seeing now, this is our busiest time, and there's still a couple of open treadmills I see, three Stairmasters---- I call it the Butt-Blaster----couple of LifeCycles----Hi, Chad.
M	CHAD	Hi Linda. Did you call that guy?
F	LINDA	Not yet! Chad is one of our trainers. I've just started internet dating and I got my first look at the, uh...
M	CUSTOMER	What service?
F	LINDA	BeWithMeDC dot com?
M	CUSTOMER	Nice.
F	LINDA	Have you used them?
M	CUSTOMER	No----two friends did and they're both hooked up. With really special guys.
F	LINDA	That's fantastic.
F	LINDA	Yes! ... English! ... Agent!
M	LINDA DRIVING	... Agent! Agent!
F	LINDA	... Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke, should I give you my account number? You have it up? Okay. I was informed that I needed pre-approval for these surgeries, and then... Yes, it was denied. ...No, those are four different operations... It's very complicated; I'm reinventing myself, it's a whole new look so it isn't just one thing, however, it's all approved by my doctor... But----madam! This is not----my job involves, you know, public interface! This is not...
M	LINDA (CONT'D)	... Yes I do understand. Could I speak to your supervisor please?
F	LINDA	Alan? Are you, uh... Linda?
M	DERMOT (OFF)	First you tell me that you can't commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN FROM THERE!
M	Plunge	Honey Nut Cheerios.
F	LINDA	Oh for Pete's sake!
M	HARRY	... and then, you know, you grow up. I guess that's what's happened with me. You just... people change. We married when I was, what, in my mid- twenties. A kid. We were kids. Twenties. You think it's forever. Then, you know, you're older----you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You go, I'm not that person. The choices you made, you can't, just through inertia----
F	KATIE	I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.
M	HARRY	... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean, frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I guess that's what I should be thinking about too. With Sandy.
F	KATIE	That's what you were just saying.
M	HARRY	Yes! Absolutely! And you should be getting rid of that bozo. No question about that. I agree.
F	KATIE	So if I were divorced----
M	HARRY	Well yes, if you were uh, you know, yes. Yes, I should settle things. With Sandy. Because of you and me. It just takes, courage, you know. To inflict that pain. Scary stuff.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	Scary stuff. You're a brave lady. Well, of course, it would be easier for you.
F	KATIE	Why's that? I don't see that.
M	HARRY	Well you know, because he's such a dope. But Sandy, she's... a good lady. A very special lady.
F	KATIE	She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.
M	HARRY	Well that's... a little----
F	KATIE	You and I should sort things out. I've told you that this is not just frivolity.
M	HARRY	No, that's understood. You've been very straight.
F	KATIE	I thought I was loud and clear.
M	HARRY	Absolutely. Not just fun and games.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... Absolutely.
F	LINDA	English!... Agent!... Agent!...
M	RECORDED VOICE	----important to us. Please stay on the line for the next available agent.
M	CHAD	Holy shit...
F	LINDA	Ted, can I talk to you about our Mickey Mouse health plan?
M	TED	Uh-huh... Hang on...
M	CHAD	This is some heavy shit.
F	LINDA	Is that my date list?
M	CHAD	No... fuck...
F	LINDA	You know, I'm trying to reinvent myself, and these procedures, which are so incredibly not cheap, this Micky Mouse HMO is saying they're not, they're... What is this?
M	CHAD	I can't believe this... This is like... intelligence shit.
M	TED	I am not comfortable with this.
F	LINDA	What is it?
M	CHAD	This is, like, I can't believe this shit I'm seeing.
M	TED	Manolo found it.
M	CHAD	Manolo found this, like, CD just lying in a locker. Locker floor. Ladies' locker room.
M	MANOLO	Jus lie-een there.
M	CHAD	And I'm like, whoa, someone's music or what, so I come in here and it's these files, man.
M	TED	I am not comfortable with this. *
M	CHAD	Like it's talking about SigInt, and signals and shit. Which, Signals means code, you know.
M	MANOLO	It was jus lie-een there.
M	CHAD	Talking about like, section heads here, and their names and shit. And then these other files are just, like, numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates and numbers... And numbers. I think * that's the shit, man. The raw intelligence.
M	TED	I am not touching this. I want this out of here.
M	CHAD	Wul... Throw it out?
F	LINDA	You can't do that! You should put a note up in the ladies' locker room.
M	CHAD	Put a note up? Highly classified shit found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA shit? Hello! Did you lose your secret CIA shit? I don't think so.
M	TED	Look, you figure it out, I am not comfortable with this. I want this * out of Hardbodies... ... We're running a gym here!
M	CHAD	Look, Manolo... ...you didn't find this.
M	MANOLO	I found it on the floor there.
M	CHAD	Yeah, I know, but­
M	MANOLO	Right there on the floor there. Lie- een there.
F	SANDY	Harry? Is that you?
M	HARRY	Yeah, yeah, it's me. "Point of Order, Oliver!"
F	LINDA	Absolut Saketini, please?
M	TED	Just a Tab.
F	LINDA	You know, it wouldn't cover all of it, but if I got some advance on my salary I could at least get the surgery ball rolling.
M	TED	Whoa! There's a payroll company, you know. They don't just advance people money. They just don't do that. I mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I * authorize it, but that's not going to mean anything to them.
F	LINDA	Well why do they have us on a cockamamie health plan? I need these surgeries, Ted!
M	TED	You're a beautiful woman! You don't need­
F	LINDA	Ted, I have gone just as far as I can go with this body! I----
M	TED	I think it's a very beautiful----it's not a phoney-baloney Hollywood body----
F	LINDA	That's right, Ted, I would be laughed out of Hollywood. I have very limited breasts and a gi-normous ass and I have this gut that swings back and forth in front a me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel.
M	TED	Oh come on!
F	LINDA	I am trying to get back in circulation. I have appetites and so forth, and, uh----
M	TED	Well there's a lot of guys who'd like you just the way you are.
F	LINDA	Yeah----losers!
M	TED	Well, I don't know. Am I a loser? Lemme tell you something. I wasn't always a manager at Hardbodies. I, um...
M	TED (CONT'D) *	Let me show you something.
F	LINDA	Omygod----is that you?!
M	TED	Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest. Congregation in Chevy Chase.
F	LINDA	Well jeez, that's a good job!
M	TED	Mm-hm.
F	LINDA	What happened?
M	TED	Well... ... It's a long story. Anyway, lotta ways I'm happier now. My point is... my point is... it's a journey.
F	LINDA	Well that's my point! I don't want to stay where I am! I want to find someone to share my journey!
M	TED	Well, sometimes, you know, you don't look in your own back yard, you're never gonna see----
F	LINDA	That's right! That's why I've started this internet dating!
M	TED	Uh-huh, but I'm saying, maybe you don't have to, you know... to----
F	LINDA	Look Ted, I know you can't authorize an advance on my salary but you can put in a request, can't you?
M	TED	It's not going to do any good, Linda.
F	LINDA	Ted, have you ever heard of the power of positive thinking?
F	LINDA	Hurrow----
M	LINDA (CONT'D)	Hello?... Where are you?... Okay. Just a second.
M	CHAD	Omygod.
M	CHAD	Omygod.
F	LINDA	Chad, you know what time it is?
M	CHAD	Uh-huh. So, like, I couldn't tell you this on your totally unsecure phone, but I know who the guy is.
F	LINDA	The guy?
M	CHAD	The guy, the secret guy.
F	LINDA	Is he high up?
M	CHAD	Um. I don't know if he's high up. Probably. I mean, I know his name, not like his rank.
F	LINDA	What is it?
M	CHAD	Osbourne. Cox.
F	LINDA	Never heard of him.
M	CHAD	Oh, like you're so plugged in to the intelligence community.
F	LINDA	I'm just saying, to the layman----
M	CHAD	Well I think like the quality of the intelligence dictates how high up he is.
F	LINDA	Uh-huh.
M	CHAD	Not what we know.
F	LINDA	Uh-huh.
M	CHAD	And I also got his----do you have any water? I gotta hydrate.
F	LINDA	I have tap water
M	CHAD	Are you kidding?
F	LINDA	How did you find out who he is?
M	CHAD	Sources.
F	LINDA	What do you mean sources?
M	CHAD	Do you have like Gatorade? Anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water?
M	CHAD (CONT'D)	... You know how far this is from my place?
F	LINDA	How do you know his name?
M	CHAD	I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos? He does computer stuff, hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs'n shit? So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on. Fucking child's play for Ernie.
F	LINDA	Uh-huh.
M	CHAD	I also have his telephone number. That was a little harder.
F	LINDA	Omygod!
M	CHAD	Shall we give him a tinkle?
F	LINDA	Omygod, why?
M	CHAD	Because he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure. You know, he's gonna be relieved. He might even be so relieved he gives us a reward----I would be very fucking surprised if he did not.
F	LINDA	Oh, wow.
M	CHAD	Very surprised. Like, you know, the * Good Samaritan tax. Which is not even a tax, really, since it's voluntary.
M	CHAD	Hello?
M	OSBOURNE	Hello?
M	CHAD	Osbourne? Osbourne Cox?
M	OSBOURNE	Yes----uh----Who is this?
M	CHAD	Are you... uh... Osbourne Cox?
M	OSBOURNE	Who is this? What time is it? Who are you?
M	CHAD	I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried.
M	OSBOURNE	Worried?
M	CHAD	About the security. Of your shit.
M	OSBOURNE	What on earth are you talking about? Who am I speaking to?
F	KATIE	Who is it?
M	CHAD	Your files----your documents. I know these documents are sensitive. But I am perfectly happy to return to you your sensitive shit. At a time of your choosing.
M	OSBOURNE	What documents? What are you talking about?
M	CHAD	... Osbourne Cox?
M	OSBOURNE	Yes! Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox! Who the fuck­
M	CHAD	Settle down, Osbourne.
F	KATIE	Who is that?
M	OSBOURNE	What documents are you talking about?
M	CHAD	"The bureau chief in Belgrade we * called Slovak the Butcher. He had very little report with his staff, his despatches were marked by----
M	OSBOURNE	very little rapport with his you fucking moron! How did get----
M	CHAD	blow a gasket, Osbourne. I
M	OSBOURNE	did you get a hold of that!
M	CHAD	not important where I----
M	OSBOURNE	in way over your fucking head! the fuck are you? You have no what you're doing!
M	CHAD	Why so uptight, Osbourne Cox? just a Good Samaritan, like, a on the road who has happened
F	LINDA	going to return it, we just
M	CHAD	I'll do it!
M	OSBOURNE	this?!
F	KATIE	what is going on.
F	LINDA	a Good Samaritan tax----
M	OSBOURNE	the fuck----
M	CHAD	You know, this is a major inconvenience for us and we thought, you know, a reward----
M	OSBOURNE	So it's money! So it's money!
M	CHAD	Well, yeah, uh... why not? I mean, this is not----am I out of line here?
M	OSBOURNE	All right, you two clowns listen to me very very carefully. I don't know who you are, but I warn you most emphatically----
F	LINDA	You warn us? You warn us? You know what, Mr., Mr. Intelligence? We warn you! We'll call you back with our demands!
M	CHAD	Hello? We just----
M	OSBOURNE	Who, who----
F	LINDA	Chad! Don't play his game!
M	OSBOURNE	Hello! Hello!
M	CHAD	Sorry.
M	CHAD (CONT'D)	... Geeze...
F	LINDA	The nerve of that guy!
M	CHAD	... I am very fucking surprised he did not give us the reward.
F	KATIE	What in God's name is going on?
M	OSBOURNE	There's some clown----a couple of clowns ----somehow got a hold of my memoir----
F	KATIE	Your what?
M	OSBOURNE	Stole it or----I have no idea how they got it----
F	KATIE	Your what?
M	OSBOURNE	My memoir, the book I'm writing.
F	KATIE	Why in God's name would they think that's worth anything.
M	OSBOURNE	Well they----I... I've no idea how they got it.
M	CHAD	But it doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball.
F	LINDA	Oh, he'll play ball! We just have to let him know who's boss.
M	CHAD	Well, that's----he sounds very senior. I think this is some senior guy who has screwed the pooch, big-time.
F	LINDA	Yeah, that's why we got him, you know, we've caught him with his thing caught in a big fat wringer.
M	CHAD	Yuh-huh.
F	LINDA	And us in the driver's seat. This is our opportunity, like, you don't get many of these. You slip on the ice outside of, you know, a fancy restaurant.
M	CHAD	Yuh-huh.
F	LINDA	Or this happens.
M	CHAD	Right.
F	LINDA	And right now this has happened.
M	CHAD	Yup. It sure has.
F	LINDA	This could put a big dent in my surgeries.
M	CHAD	Big time.
F	SANDY	Honey! Honey!
M	HARRY'S VOICE	Huh?
F	SANDY	My cab is here, I'm off. Mystery man. ... What is that thing?
M	HARRY	Oh baby. Top secret.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... You're gonna knock 'em dead.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... How many cities?
F	SANDY	Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago.
M	HARRY	Why do they always have you do Seattle. Not a big market.
F	SANDY	I don't know, lots of independent bookstores. Rains all day, what are people gonna do.
M	HARRY	I can think of a couple of things.
F	SANDY	You can think of one thing.
F	SANDY	It better be the Peninsula. The money I make for them. Are you gonna be okay?
M	HARRY	I'll be sad. But I'll be okay.
F	SANDY	Not too sad..
M	HARRY	Just the right amount.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... I am crazy about you, baby.
M	BOGUS	Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison and Zoe * Caldwell. It was marvelous. First * time I've attended the Kennedy Honors. Jane Alexander is a client. Old * friend of Zoe's. What an actress. * Anyway... ... Connie, could you bring in your copy of the Cox financials?
M	SECRETARY	I thought I had it here on a disk----I don't know where the disk is. I'm sorry, I'll have to run another off my hard drive.
M	BOGUS	Tony sang "The Best Is Yet To Come." * Mr. Bennett.
M	BOGUS (CONT'D)	Yeah, okay.
M	BOGUS (CONT'D)	So. We've drawn up the papers and are prepared to execute service on Osbourne if you so elect, Mrs. Cox. Our missiles are pointed at his capital, so to speak, and we await only your word. But, be mindful, madam: once these missiles are launched, there is no recalling them. We are not picking daisies. We are declaring war, and hostilities will then impose their own logic. I think you understand what I'm saying.
F	KATIE	It'll piss Ozzie off.
M	BOGUS	Mm-hm.
F	KATIE	Mr. Terikhian, I have given my husband second chances galore. There are limits to my charity.
M	BOGUS	Of course. But since we are at the point of no return, I always urge my clients at this juncture to give it one more day of reflection.
F	KATIE	Yes. Understood.
F	LINDA	Harry? I'm Linda.
M	HARRY	Yeah, I did the whole bodyguard thing for years. My guy was in State, the Secretary in fact, so of course I traveled a lot. ..."Ironside is leaving the building." We called him Iron Ass. ... Not to his face, of course. Not to his ass, either! ... Ah, he was okay. But, Personal Protection----that's a young man's game.
F	LINDA	You wanna try these dumplings? They're * delicious.
M	HARRY	Sure... ... Does it have shellfood in it? *
F	LINDA	Shellfood? *
M	HARRY	`Cause I have this sensitivity. I, uh, * go into anaphylactic shock. My larynx * swells up, closes off the----Ah what the * hell. *
M	HARRY (CONT'D) *	Live dangerously---- *
M	HARRY (CONT'D) *	... Can't always wear a condom.
F	LINDA	That's right! Not always!
M	HARRY	Anyway, my job's more administrative * now, not so much PP. Personal * Protection. Though I still carry the gun.
F	LINDA	Omygod, really!
M	HARRY	no big deal. Never discharged twenty years service. Security now. I don't think about it---- you're not supposed to think it;
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	in a situation where your man is threatened the training kicks in. Muscle memory. Reflex----Those are outrageous.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... Wanna swap?
F	LINDA	No way!
M	HARRY	----but there was just a hell of a lot of political infighting, petty, petty, shit, and then basically the old man stepped on Goldberger's throat. Nice...
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... Wide-plank pine?
F	LINDA	I guess.
M	HARRY	Listen, full disclosure here Linda...
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... I'm not wearing a wedding ring but I am married. Took the ring off, what, eighteen months ago when we agreed to separate. Agreed to disagree. That's about the only thing we ever agreed on.
F	LINDA	Thanks for telling me. I really do appreciate it, Harry.
M	HARRY	Well, full transparency, the only way to----
F	LINDA	That's not gonna go off, is it?
M	HARRY	Well let's go in the other room and find out! Grrr!
M	TED	That's great. That sounds... exciting.
F	LINDA	He's very very communicative. Very accessible. He has a sense of humor. And he agrees one hundred percent about my surgeries.
M	TED	Well, I----
F	LINDA	He thinks my ass could be smaller. I mean, not in a mean way, he kidded about it----he's got a terrific sense of humor.
M	TED	That's good, but... but... Linda, what do you really know about this guy?
F	LINDA	I told you, he's in the Treasury Department and he----
M	TED	But he could be one of these people who, you know, who cruises the internet----
F	LINDA	Yeah, so am I!
F	LINDA	No, you can't go like that! You gotta wear a suit.
M	CHAD	Well----you mean----go home and change?
F	LINDA	Yeah!
M	CHAD	I was gonna ride my bike. Do I have time?
F	KATIE	----which to my mind is all the more reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.
M	HARRY	Mm.
F	KATIE	That's it? "Mm"?
M	HARRY	I'm just... wondering if it's the right time.
F	KATIE	Of course it's the right time. Why wouldn't it be the right time. Does it threaten you?
M	HARRY	No no. No, you and me are rock solid. That's why I, uh, I think we can afford to be big. We can think about Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with, um----
F	KATIE	Is that how you see me, "hammering" him?
M	HARRY	Of course not, but----
F	KATIE	Weren't those your words?
M	HARRY	Yes, but----
F	KATIE	I don't "hammer."
M	HARRY	No, uh-huh, of course not. But, I'm saying----I'm no friend of the guy. You know that. I think he's an arrogant little geek. But for Christ sakes, you and me have all the time in the world, and he just lost his job----
F	KATIE	He didn't lose it, he quit.
M	HARRY	Yeah. Most of the people who "quit" in this town were fired. ... I feel sorry for the guy. And he'll be easier to deal with when he doesn't feel... cornered.
F	KATIE	Maybe. As long as we're talking about Ozzie and not you.
M	HARRY	Of course we're talking about Ozzie. Baby, I stand by you whatever you do. I adore you.
F	KATIE	Please get the check.
M	KATIE (CONT'D)	...Yes?... Yes?... Is there blood in his stool?...Yes, soon.
M	KATIE (CONT'D)	It's after two. I have to get back to work.
M	HARRY	I love you so much.
M	CHAD	Osbourne Cox?
M	OSBOURNE	And you, I take it, are "Mr. Black"?
M	CHAD	Yes I am. You have the money?
M	OSBOURNE	The fifty-thousand dollars.
M	CHAD	That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne Cox.
M	OSBOURNE	All right. Let me explain something to you, "Mr. Black." You know who I am; I know who you are.
M	CHAD	Perhaps. But appearances can be---- deceptive.
M	OSBOURNE	Yeah. What you're engaged in is blackmail, which is a felony. That's for starters.
M	CHAD	Appearances can be----deceptive. I am a mere Good Samar----
M	OSBOURNE	Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination of classified material is a federal crime. If you ever carried out your proposed threat, you would experience such a shitstorm of consequences, my friend, it would make your empty little head spin faster than your Schwinn bicycle over there.
M	CHAD	You think that's a Schwinn?
M	OSBOURNE	Now give me the fucking floppy or the CD or whatever the fuck you have it on, and I will----
M	CHAD	As soon as you give me the money, dickwad! I'm not----Huhgf! ... You fuck!
M	OSBOURNE	Give it to me, fuck!
M	CHAD	You fuck! You fucker!
M	OSBOURNE	I know who you are, fucker!
M	CHAD	You're the fucker!
F	LINDA	Where's the money?
M	CHAD	He hit me!
F	LINDA	Where's the money?!
M	CHAD	He didn't give it to me­
F	LINDA	Oh, for----Get in!
M	CHAD	That fucker!
M	CHAD	... Hey----what're you----
M	CHAD (CONT'D)	Oh shit!
M	OSBOURNE	Holy fucking----you fucking morons!
F	LINDA	That'll give him something to think about.
M	CHAD	Wait, wait! We gotta go back!
F	LINDA	I knew this would happen.
M	CHAD	We gotta go back! My bike!
F	LINDA	It's on to Plan B.
M	CHAD	It's just a Kryptonite lock----you can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!
F	LINDA	Heavens sakes----
M	CHAD	Where we going? My bike!
F	LINDA	Some people!
M	CHAD	... What is this?
F	LINDA	Russian Embassy.
F	LINDA	I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping * by?
M	CHAD	Is there a men's room? bureaucrat. This is Krapotkin.
M	KRAPOTKIN	----Not exactly. I am assistant cultural attaché. The organs of state security are not allowed to function within the borders of your country.
F	LINDA	... The organs of state security?
M	KRAPOTKIN	Yes.
F	LINDA	But if I had, oh, say, secrets of a highly, um, secrets that would interest the organs of state security...
M	KRAPOTKIN	Yes.
F	LINDA	... This is just a taste.
M	KRAPOTKIN	May I ask the source of this...
F	LINDA	No you may not.
M	CHAD	Very high up.
F	LINDA	Chad!
M	CHAD	I'm just saying he's high up!
M	KRAPOTKIN	PC or Meck?
F	LINDA	Um. PC. *
M	KRAPOTKIN	Could you wait please?
F	LINDA	Well---- ... I have a date----
M	LINDA (CONT'D) *	The fish. Has bitten. *
M	CHAD *	What? Oh, yeah. Yeah, he seems cool. ... That fucker really hit me.
M	MAN	Could you accompany me please?
F	LINDA	Well----okay...
M	NEW EMBASSY MAN	Can you tell me where this material comes from?
M	CHAD	Name, rank and serial number.
M	NEW EMBASSY MAN	Excuse me?
M	CHAD	We, um... we know our rights.
F	LINDA	This is just a taste.
M	NEW EMBASSY MAN	There is more material?
F	LINDA	There's a lot more. But we need to be paid.
M	NEW EMBASSY MAN	You are not ideological.
M	CHAD	I don't think so.
F	LINDA	Look, I have a date.
M	NEW EMBASSY MAN	Hm?
F	LINDA	Date.
M	NEW EMBASSY MAN	... We will examine the material. How do I contact?
F	LINDA	We work at the Hardbodies in Alexandria.
M	CHAD	I'm at 1442 Westerly----
F	LINDA	Chad, not your home address!
M	NEW EMBASSY MAN	So... I call Hardbodies, I ask for... Chad?
F	LINDA	No. Linda. *
M	TED	A line to check in, towels piling up.
F	LINDA	I'm sorry.
M	TED	Manolo running around like crazy----what happened to your nose?
M	CHAD	I just----
M	TED	This is not acceptable at Hardbodies. You two know better than that.
F	LINDA	Yes we do. I'm sorry, Ted.
M	TED	This is no way.
M	CHAD	It was unavoidable. This won't happen again.
M	TED	But you won't tell me what's going on.
F	LINDA	We can't. I... I... Ted, I know this is terrible, but----I have to run. I have a date.
M	TED	You're changing, Linda.
M	TED (CONT'D)	... Very sad.
F	KATIE	Ozzie! Goddamnit, Ozzie, what have you done to the car?!
F	KATIE	Ozzie!

M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... You haven't seen this, have you?
F	LINDA	Oh! No, no I haven't.
M	HARRY	I hear it's terrific.

M	HARRY	Oh! Come on downstairs. Do you like surprises?
F	LINDA	Well, I'm very open to new experiences...
M	HARRY	I gotta tell ya----I saw an ad for this in a gentleman's magazine----twelve hundred bucks. I take a look at this thing, I think, Jesus, you gotta be kidding----I'm a hobbyist, this is basically nothing but speed-rail, I could probably go to Home Depot and whip this up myself for, like, a hundred bucks...
F	LINDA	... What is it?
M	HARRY	What is it. You siddown, feet in the stirrups, and...
F	LINDA	Omygod!
M	LINDA (CONT'D)	... It's fantastic!
M	HARRY	Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks all-in if you don't count my labor. And the, you know----cost of the dildo. Those things are not cheap.
F	LINDA	Uh-uh.
M	HARRY	But I lack the, uh, I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.

M	PALMER	Olson. What's up.
M	MAN	Palmer. What's up.
M	PALMER	Not quite certain, sir, but it's... messy.
M	PALMER (CONT'D)	... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have computer files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osbourne Cox.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Kolyma-2?
M	PALMER	Our man in the Russian Embassy.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Mm.
M	PALMER	It was brought to them by a woman who----
M	GARDNER CHUBB	The Russians?
M	PALMER	Yeah. It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the folder. With Pfarrer's.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	The Russians.
M	PALMER	Yeah.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Who's Pfarrer?
M	PALMER	Treasury agent who's been, um, screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows about it, they all seem to be sleeping with each other.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	All right. Spare me. Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's gotten... complicated. He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Shot----your analyst?
M	PALMER	Ozzie wasn't there. Our man surveying hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy wrestle something into his car, follows him; he dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Well----what'd he do that for?
M	PALMER	Don't know sir.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the body out?
M	PALMER	Mm-hm.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Russian? American?
M	PALMER	Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	And this... Linda...?
M	PALMER	Linda Litzke.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	She's Treasury?
M	PALMER	No, we're----um... fuzzy on her.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Well----so----we don't really know what anyone is after.
M	PALMER	Not really, sir.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	This analyst, ex-analyst, uh...
M	PALMER	Cox.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Yeah. What's his clearance level.
M	PALMER	Three.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Okay. Okay, no biggie...
M	GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)	... for now just keep an eye on everyone, see what they do.
M	PALMER	Right, sir. And----we'll interface with the FBI on this, uh, dead body?
M	GARDNER CHUBB	No! No, we don't want those idiots blundering around in this. Burn the body. Get rid of it. And keep an eye on everyone, see what they do. Report back when, um, I don't know. When it makes sense.

F	LINDA	Foreigner?

F	LINDA	Ted, we know what we're doing. Let me ask you this: did he know my name.

M	HARRY	You want... Sandy's number?
M	MAN	Can I use your phone? To call a tow?
M	SANDY'S VOICE	Hello?
M	OSBOURNE	Sandy?
F	SANDY	Yes?
M	OSBOURNE	Hi, it's Osbourne Cox, how are you. Hi.
F	SANDY	... Hi.
M	OSBOURNE	Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but I have a, well, a publishing question and I thought you might be the person to ask, I have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but I think it's pretty explosive stuff and I think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where I'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so I'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in fact----so I was thinking, I know you, and you seem to do well, so I was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. The people you use.
F	SANDY	You've written a children's book?
M	OSBOURNE	No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but ----doesn't your company have an adult arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's arm? Of a regular publisher?
F	SANDY	Pappas & Swain do children's literature.
M	OSBOURNE	Uh-huh. I see. So they don't---- okay... Are you well?
F	SANDY	Very well thank you. And you.
M	OSBOURNE	Yes. Good. Okay, well, thank you Sandy.
F	SANDY	Yes. Good talking to you.
M	OSBOURNE	Bitch.
M	KRAPOTKIN	Yes, madam. Can we help you?
F	LINDA	What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are you running?! I've been waiting here for fifty-five minutes, and I'm----
M	KRAPOTKIN	I am so sorry, madam. An urgent matter.
F	LINDA	Well this could be urgent too, since, you know, Chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and----
M	KRAPOTKIN	I don't know the whereabouts of Chad, madam.
F	LINDA	Well he was gathering information for you when he----
M	KRAPOTKIN	We're not interested in such "information". It was drivel.
F	LINDA	... Dribble!
M	KRAPOTKIN	Would you like your disk back?
F	LINDA	... Dribble!
M	KRAPOTKIN	I'm so sorry I can't help you.
F	LINDA	I'll tell you what's dribble! You listen to me, Mr. Krapkin! I am----
F	LINDA	Cut it out.
M	OSBOURNE	... What?
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... What the fuck? What the fuck?
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... Yes... No... Yes, I want to know why the check for my slip fee was returned for insufficient funds... Slip fee, for docking my boat, the check was returned...

M	HARRY	I am depressed. I gotta exercise. I haven't run in three days... butt- crunches... anything... Do you think I could stay here for a little while? ... What? What's wrong, baby?
F	LINDA	It can't always come from me, Harry! I'm not that strong!
M	HARRY	What's wrong, baby? Harry's here.
F	LINDA	You're not here for me! I need a can- do person! You're all... defeated!
M	HARRY	I'm sorry, baby----
F	LINDA	Chad is the only can-do person I know and he's gone, Harry, he's gone.
M	HARRY	I'll be good. I'll be better. I just need to exercise. Are there pedestrian paths around here?
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... Who the fuck is Chad?
F	LINDA	Could you help me find him? He's a friend from work. You know law enforcement people, right? You could call, unofficially?
M	HARRY	Wait a minute, what's his name? What happened?
F	LINDA	Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared. He hasn't been at work or at home for two days.
M	HARRY	Okay.
F	LINDA	He----
M	HARRY	You know his social security number?
F	LINDA	Huh? NO! I----
M	HARRY	It's okay. That's okay. What's the last place you saw him?
F	LINDA	I don't know! He just disappeared! The last place I saw him was the Jamba Juice on K Street. And he's gone.
M	HARRY	Okay baby. We'll find your friend. Missing person. Piece of cake.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	No, stay open...
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)	... You have to let the doctor look in your mouth.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)	... Now you listen to me, young man. You do as I say or I'll ask your mother to leave the doctor's office and the two of us will sort out what's what.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)	... Yes. ... With a patient.
M	OSBOURNE	Yeah? The same patient she's been with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT!
M	FILTERED VOICE	Dr. Cox has suggested you call her attorney----
M	OSBOURNE	Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new fucking keys!
M	OSBOURNE	New keys...
F	SANDY	And it was just then----at that very moment----that Oliver sneezed----
M	DEL	Can we just----I'm sorry to interrupt but we have to let the folks at home see this illustration! Can we just get a shot of that...
M	DEL (CONT'D)	There----there it is. Oliver. Interrupting the filibuster with----
M	CONNIE	That's wonderful!
M	DEL	Wonderful! The book is "Point of Order, Oliver!" and the talented author is Sandra Pfarrer. We're gonna go to a station break and then be right back with Bud Fraighling, the Sultan of Salad, and Part Two of our special interview with Dermot Mulroney. So keep it where it is!
M	DEL (CONT'D)	...Great segment.
F	SANDY	Thank you.
M	DEL	Yeah, you know we thought it might be fun if you joined us with Bud Fraighling and help make the Fiesta Salad, when we move over.
M	CONNIE	Over on the kitchen set.
F	SANDY	That wasn't discussed.
M	DEL	Oh, sure! No! Only if you want to! Your segment went great, we just thought----
F	SANDY	I'm sorry, I made plans.
M	DEL	Okay, great!
M	CONNIE	Great to see you again, Sandra!
M	OSBOURNE	New... fucking... keys... How's this for access...
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... How's this for motherfucking access...
M	PR WOMAN	That was way out of line. We were so unbelievably clear with them: just an Oliver segment.
F	SANDY	It's fine.
M	PR WOMAN	Del and Connie are such putzes.
F	SANDY	It's fine. Thank you. We're finished.
M	PR WOMAN	Huh? Well, okay. Great, uh----
F	SANDY	Thought that would never be over.
M	MAN	Mmm. Me too.
F	SANDY	Let me scrub this crap off my face.
M	OSBOURNE	Just for starters...
M	HARRY	Hello there sunshine. You look great.
F	LINDA	Well you seem better.
M	HARRY	Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time this morning. And our exercise last night didn't hurt!
F	LINDA	Harry!
M	HARRY	Boy, I am through banging my head against the wall. I am gonna start doing what's right for me.
F	LINDA	That's how I believe, also. You have to do what's right for----
M	HARRY	Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a shock recently, and I realized you know, life is not infinite. No one's immortal.
F	LINDA	No one's immortal.
M	HARRY	You have to get from each day its full, uh, squeeze the juice from every day because there but for the grace of God----
F	LINDA	Exactly. The important thing is to maintain a positive outlook. Always up. Always ebullient.
M	HARRY	That's right, don't sweat the small stuff... ... and it's all small stuff.
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	This is where we first met. Remember?
F	LINDA	Of course I do.
M	HARRY	You never know what the important days are, until... until, um... ... I told myself I was gonna stop being paranoid, but... is that guy looking at us?
F	LINDA	No, no.
M	LINDA (CONT'D)	... Have you found out anything about Chad?
M	HARRY	Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls. I don't think it'll take long.
F	LINDA	Really?
M	HARRY	Oh yeah, there are so many data bases now it's a joke... ... Back when I was in PP there was still some art to finding people. Not any more. And now with the cell phones? Pretty soon they're gonna know where everyone is. Everyone. At any given moment. I mean it's almost the reality now. You would be amazed.
F	LINDA	Uh-huh.
M	HARRY	Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice ----did Chad say anything about where he might be going?
F	LINDA	Oh, I know where he was going.
M	HARRY	Oh yeah?
F	LINDA	A residence in Alexandria. On Hillsboro Drive.
M	LINDA (CONT'D)	... 2055 Hillsboro. ... It's, um. The residence of a guy named Osbourne Cox.
M	HARRY	Who are you? ... WHO ARE YOU? ... WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?
M	HARRY (CONT'D)	... WHO ARE YOU? REALLY?
F	LINDA	I'm ... just ... Linda Litzke.
M	LINDA (CONT'D)	... Harry!
M	OSBOURNE	Ow! Fuck!
F	LINDA	Oh for Pete's sake.
M	OSBOURNE	And you are... my wife's lover.
M	TED	No.
M	OSBOURNE	Then what are you doing here.
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... I know you. You're the guy at the gym.
M	TED	I'm not here representing Hardbodies. I know what you represent. You represent the idiocy of today.
M	TED	I don't represent that, either.
M	OSBOURNE	Oh yes. You're the guy when I went to ask about that moronic woman.
M	TED	She's not----
M	OSBOURNE	You're in league with that moronic woman. You're part of a league of morons.
M	TED	No.
M	OSBOURNE	Yes. You're one of the morons I've been fighting all my life. My whole fucking life. But guess what. Guess what. Today I win.
M	TED	Ah!
M	OSBOURNE	Oh!
M	OSBOURNE (CONT'D)	... Oooph! ... Stop! Intruder!
M	OSBOURNE	Intruder!
M	TED	Oh!
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Wait.
M	GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)	... Wait a minute. Where's the treasury guy? Pfarrer?
M	PALMER	Right now?
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Right now.
M	PALMER	In a detention room at Washington Dulles. *
M	GARDNER CHUBB	... Why?
M	PALMER	He was trying to board a flight to Venezuela.
M	PALMER (CONT'D)	We had his name on a hot list, the INS pulled him. Don't know why he was going to Venezuela.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	You don't know.
M	PALMER	No sir.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	We have no extradition with Venezuela. Oh. Uh-huh. Well----what should we do with him?
M	GARDNER CHUBB	For fuck's sake, put him on the next flight to Venezuela!
M	PALMER	Yes sir. Okay.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Okay. So the gym manager is dead.
M	PALMER	Yes sir.
M	GARDENER CHUBB	The body is----
M	PALMER	Gone, sir.
M	GARDENER CHUBB	Okay----
M	PALMER	But----there was a, uh... snag...
M	GARDNER CHUBB	What.
M	PALMER	Well. This analyst, Cox, was attacking the gym guy. It was broad daylight, on the street. Our man there didn't know what to do. He felt he had to step in.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Yes?
M	PALMER	He, uh... He shot the analyst. He shot Cox.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Good! Great! Is he dead?
M	PALMER	No sir.
M	PALMER (CONT'D)	... He's in coma. They're not sure whether he'll make it. They think, they're pretty sure he has no brain function.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Okay. Okay. If he wakes up we'll worry about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck. That's it then. No one else really knows anything. Okay.
M	PALMER	Um. Well sir, there is...
M	GARDNER CHUBB	What.
M	PALMER	Um...
M	GARDNER CHUBB	What.
M	PALMER	There is the woman. The gym woman. Linda Litzke.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Oh yeah. Fuck. Where is she.
M	PALMER	We picked her up. We have her.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Can we, uh----
M	PALMER	She, she, she says she'll play ball if we pay for some... I know this sounds odd----some surgeries she wants. Cosmetic surgery. She says she'll sit on everything.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	How much.
M	PALMER	There were several procedures. All together they run to, um----
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Pay it.
M	PALMER	Yes sir. Should I pay it out of, should it be from----
M	GARDNER CHUBB	One of the black accounts, I don't give a shit. The January fund. Whatever.
M	PALMER	Okay.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Jesus. Jesus fucking Christ.
M	GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)	... What did we learn, Palmer.
M	PALMER	I don't know, sir.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	I don't fucking know either. I guess we learned not to do it again.
M	PALMER	Yes sir.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Although I'm fucked if I know what we did.
M	PALMER	Yes sir. Hard to say.
M	GARDNER CHUBB	Jesus. Jesus fucking Christ.
