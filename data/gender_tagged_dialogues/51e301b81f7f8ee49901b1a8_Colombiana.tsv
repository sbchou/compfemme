M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	VOICE	Cataleya!
M	MOTHER	Cat! Is your homework finished yet?
F	CAT	Working on it Mama.
M	MOTHER	You draw beautifully my love, but if you want to be something in life you have to study.
F	CAT	I am studying Mama. I want to be a super hero.
M	MOTHER	Better to be a doctor. A lawyer.
F	CAT	Are we going to see Uncle Emilio?
M	MOTHER	I don't know. Just waiting to hear from your father.
M	DON LUIS	I can't believe this.
M	FABIO	Why not?
M	DON LUIS	Because I love you Fabio. Like a brother.
M	FABIO	And I love you Don Luis. Like a brother.
M	DON LUIS	Can you believe this guy Marco? We started when we were little...how old were we Fabio?
M	FABIO	Ten.
M	DON LUIS	Ten year old bastards stealing apples from the carts in the market. After all we've been through. And now we're on top, he wants to leave...
M	FABIO	Luis, I'm going to be honest with you. You remember I had that operation?
M	DON LUIS	That was last year.
M	FABIO	Since then, I'm not a hundred percent. And you can't do this thing if you're not a hundred percent. I'm tired.
M	DON LUIS	So you'll take a rest.
M	FABIO	You know how many times we should have been dead?
M	DON LUIS	I don't even want to count.
M	FABIO	Neither do I. But you gotta think. How lucky we are to still be alive.
M	DON LUIS	Yeah. That's right. We're alive. And what about the future of this thing we built?
M	FABIO	It's yours. It's not my thing any more.
M	DON LUIS	I'm not going to talk you out of it, am I cabron?
M	FABIO	I'll always be there for you Luis. Just pick up the phone, I'm there.
M	DON LUIS	I'm gonna hold you to that. You bastard. I'm going to miss you.
M	FABIO	And I'm going to miss you.
M	DON LUIS	OK. Enough of this sentimental bullshit. Next we'll be crying like two old women. Come on! One last drink, huh?
M	DON LUIS	To the future.
M	FABIO	Bueno.
M	DON LUIS	So. Business is all clear?
M	FABIO	All clear.
M	FABIO	It's all here.
M	DON LUIS	No other copies?
M	FABIO	You even have to ask?
M	DON LUIS	Hey.
M	FABIO	Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't get in too much trouble.
M	MARCO	Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.
M	DON LUIS	Kill this motherfucker.
M	FABIO	This fucker! The motherfucker!
M	DRIVER	Not OK Boss?
M	FABIO	This bastard thinks I'm an idiot. Playing it all mellow and shit. If he would have yelled and screamed and threatened to kill my whole family, it would have been OK. We have an hour to get out of here. At most.
M	MOTHER	Fabio?
M	FABIO	We've got ten minutes.
M	MOTHER	Cataleya, go pack!
F	CAT	I'm packed Mama.
M	FABIO	Listen to me my darling. Just in case of anything. This...
M	FABIO	This is your passport. Do you understand?
M	FABIO	You find yourself alone? You go to the address on this card. Show it to the man at the front gate.
F	CAT	I don't understand papa.
M	FABIO	You don't have to understand. You just have to listen, and remember.
M	MAN	Hola. We want to see Don Fabio.
M	BODYGUARD	He's not home.
M	MAN	You mind if we wait?
M	BODYGUARD	Your time.
M	FABIO	And this will keep you safe.
M	FABIO	The Cataleya orchid. It comes from one place on Earth. Our place. My mother, your grandmother, used to grow them. Every morning I would wake up to the sight of them. The smell of them. That's why I named you after them. It reminds us of who we are.
M	MOTHER	I'm ready.
M	MAN	They said he's not home yet.
M	MAN	OK. OK.
M	MAN	Change of plans.
M	FABIO	Back!
M	FABIO	Too late. Get ready!
M	FABIO	I love you very much.
F	CAT	I love you too Papa.
M	FABIO	Alicia!
M	MARCO	You in the kitchen. You, the bedroom. You, the back.
M	MARCO	Hey! What are you doing?
M	GUNMAN	Don Luis said kill everyone.
M	MARCO	He also said no names.
M	GUNMAN	She won't remember.
M	MARCO	HEY!
M	MARCO	She's a kid.
M	GUNMAN	So what?
M	MARCO	What do you mean so what? You take a kid, teach them, they have value.
M	GUNMAN	I couldn't even get ten bucks for her in the street.
M	MARCO	Are you stupid or what? Here.
M	MARCO	Here's twenty asshole. Go do your job.
M	MARCO	Remember me Cataleya?
M	MARCO	I was at your confirmation. My name is Marco, and I was a very good friend of your father. I see he gave you his medal.
M	MARCO	The Cataleya orchid. His symbol. Your name. That's good. This way you will always remember him. I know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.
M	MARCO	Some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. This is one of them. But I am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. So you understand. Now, you know who Don Luis is?
M	MARCO	Of course you do. He was your father's best friend since they're kids. He's like an Uncle to you. You know he has always been good to your family, don't you?
M	MARCO	This house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. Even your school fees. All this comes from Don Luis. You know that?
M	MARCO	But when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. Things like...
M	MARCO	This.
M	MARCO	I know you are a smart girl. You do well in school. So I know this is not too complicated for you to understand. Am I right?
M	MARCO	Good. Now, your father had something that belonged to Don Luis. A little thing. No bigger than...
M	MARCO	This. Maybe it was in this.
M	MARCO	Do you know what I am talking about?
M	MARCO	Excellent. Do you know where it is?
M	MARCO	Well, if you give it to me, Don Luis will be very grateful. And very generous. He will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. You will have everything you want. But if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. And you see what happens when he is not happy, yes?
M	MARCO	So why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. Will you do that?
M	MARCO	You are a smart girl.
M	MARCO	And in this life, smart girls get everything they want. What do you want Cat?
M	MARCO	Just tell me sweetheart...what do you want?
F	CAT	To kill Don Luis!
M	MARCO	AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!
M	MARCO	Get her!
M	TRACK WITH CAT	
M	MARCO	We need her alive!
M	MARCO	Go! Go!
M	ON THE GUNMEN	
M	MARCO	There!
M	MARCO	Alive!
M	MARCO	North! Go North! We're cutting off the southern streets!
M	GUNMAN	North!
M	GUNMAN	Let's go.
M	MARCO	We got her! Close the net!
M	ON MARCO	
M	MARCO	What is she doing?
M	MARCO	No!
M	MARCO	Get down there!
M	GUNMAN	We lost her!
M	MARCO	FUCK! FUCK!
M	MARCO V.O.	Come back out.
M	VOICE	Excuse me...
M	AMERICAN 1	And you say you have something for us?
M	AMERICAN 1	May I see it?
M	AMERICAN 1	Oh jeez...
M	AMERICAN 1	Thank you.
M	AMERICAN 1	We have to record this.
M	AMERICAN 1	Where did you get this?
F	CAT	My Papa.
M	AMERICAN 1	And where is your Papa?
F	CAT	Dead.
M	AMERICAN 1	Did he tell you what this is?
F	CAT	Yes...my passport.
M	VOICE	We are making our final approach to Miami International airport. Please fasten your seat belts.
M	MAN	Come with me.
M	BUREAUCRAT	She's the one?
M	MAN	She is indeed.
M	BUREAUCRAT	You must have done something pretty important to get the royal treatment little lady.
M	BUREAUCRAT	Welcome to America.
M	MAN	You like music?
M	VOICE	It's been our mission statement since we first opened our doors in nineteen twenty three...
M	HEADMISSTRESS	To provide a safe, healthy nurturing environment where young women can get the education they will need to meet the challenges of that amazing adventure called life. How does that sound to you, my dear?
M	MAN	It's been a long day for her. Here's the check for the year's tuition.
M	MAN	And the five hundred dollars allowance for the first six months.
M	HEADMISSTRESS	Which we keep right here...
M	HEADMISSTRESS	And give you twenty a week for incidentals.
M	HEADMISSTRESS	What do we say darling?
F	CAT	Where do I sleep?
M	MONITOR	Girls, this is your new classmate. Please welcome her and show her the ropes. Wake up is at seven. Sweet dreams.
M	SHERRI	I'm Sherri. And you are?
F	CAT	Very tired.
M	SHERRI	Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you want to lay down and rest your little head?
F	CAT	I do.
M	SHERRI	There's your bed...
F	CAT	But it's gonna cost you. Twenty dollars.
M	SHERRI	A week. Peace has it's price, y'know what I'm saying?
M	SHERRI	Are we clear on that?
F	CAT	Twenty dollars a week.
M	SHERRI	We got a smart one!
M	SHERRI	You can go now. In peace.
M	TICKET AGENT	Hola chica, where are we wanting to go today?
M	TICKET AGENT	Chicago is not next door, you know.
F	CAT	How much?
M	MAN	Hey kid. You know what time it is?
M	MAN	It's late, and this is not the kind of place a kid should be hanging out. What are you doing here?
M	MAN	Who are you?
F	CAT	Cataleya.
M	MAN	Wait here.
M	MAN	Emilio.
M	MAN	There's a girl looking for you.
M	EMILIO	I'm not interested in a girl right now.
M	MAN	It's not that sort of thing. She's eight.
M	MAN	Says her name's Cataleya.
M	MAN	Come with me.
M	MAN	Hey!
M	EMILIO	Cataleya?
F	CAT	Uncle Emilio?
M	EMILIO	Madonna! I thought you were dead!
M	EMILIO	I thought you were all...
M	EMILIO	You're safe now.
M	EMILIO	You're safe.
M	EMILIO	Gracias mama.
M	EMILIO	Good morning.
F	MAMA	Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit. I'll make you some eggs.
F	MAMA	You have your mother's beautiful eyes. Don't be scared. This is your home.
M	EMILIO	When was the last time you slept?
F	CAT	I don't know. A long time ago.
M	EMILIO	Well good. A growing body needs sleep. When I was your age I would sleep half the day. I don't know if it helped with the growing, but I was well rested for whatever came after.
F	CAT	Whose room is that?
M	EMILIO	My son. Your cousin.
F	CAT	Where is he?
M	EMILIO	He's dead.
F	CAT	Killed?
M	EMILIO	Yes.
F	CAT	By who?
M	EMILIO	No one who is still alive.
M	EMILIO	You are very talented. Is this what you want to be? An artist?
F	CAT	I used to want to be like Lara. A super agent.
M	EMILIO	Not anymore?
M	EMILIO	And now?
F	CAT	I want to be a killer.
F	CAT	Can you help?
M	EMILIO	Sure.
M	EMILIO	The good news is your father bought you your life with what he gave you. The bad news is Don Luis was playing both sides, and has disappeared. You tore down everything he spent years building up with that little chip. It is something he will not forget. There is a law in this thing of ours. If someone does you, the revenge goes all the way down the line. Women, children, Grandmothers, dogs, cats. No exceptions.
F	CAT	Are you trying to scare me?
M	EMILIO	I am trying to educate you.
M	PRINCIPAL	Normally we don't accept students in the middle of the academic year, but under the circumstances, losing her parents in that tragic car accident...
M	PRINCIPAL	Here.
M	PRINCIPAL	These are the school supplies you'll need.
M	EMILIO	She's still in a bit of shock.
M	PRINCIPAL	Of course. See you Monday Cataleya. Such a pretty name.
M	EMILIO	We'll get all this stuff, then go over to this little place I know down on Maxwell street for some of these hot dogs the Polish people make here.
M	EMILIO	You like hot dogs?
M	EMILIO	Hey!
M	EMILIO	Hey!
M	EMILIO	Where you going?
F	CAT	I've already been to school. I told you what I want to be. You don't want to help me, fine. I'll do it myself.
M	EMILIO	Chica. Any idiot can be a killer. Look!
M	EMILIO	You want me to teach you to be a killer? No problema. I'll teach you. But you'll be dead in five years.
M	EMILIO (CONT'D)	If you want to be a killer, and survive, you have to be a smart one. You have to know things besides how to pull a trigger. You have to know how the world works. How people think. You got to learn to be psychological. That I cannot teach you, unless you learn the basics at school. Got it?
M	EMILIO	Now what's it going to be?
F	CAT	But I still want to be a killer.
M	EMILIO	Cabron!
M	COP 1	So then I suggest, y'know, we buy some things to spice it up a bit.
M	COP 2	Define things.
M	COP 1	A garter belt, some of those stockings that come up the thigh...it's fourteen years. Know what I mean?
M	COP 2	Yeah. No matter how much you like steak, sometime a lamb chop is not a bad thing. Exactly.
M	COP 1	What the...
M	SUPERMODEL	Oops... That's all you have to say? Oops?
M	COP 1	Funny?
M	COP 1	Wanna laugh you crazy bitch? I'll give you something to laugh about!
M	SERGEANT	No license, no registration. No ID except a library card. Well Ms...
M	SERGEANT	Valarie Phillips in addition to all that...you're being charged here with DUI, destruction of police property, driving the wrong way on a two way street...
F	CAT	Is that it?
M	SERGEANT	Unless you can think of anything else you should be charged with.
F	CAT	Wearing no panties?
M	SERGEANT	That's not a crime.
F	CAT	Thank goodness.
M	SERGEANT	Take her in the back, lock her up, put a cup of coffee in with her. Let her sleep it off, we'll book her tomorrow.
M	MARSHAL	US Marshal Warren. We have Gennaro Rizzo here on an overnight.
M	SERGEANT	Who?
M	MARSHAL	Rizzo. The Mafia guy? On the way to testify up in San Francisco tomorrow? They didn't notify you?
M	SERGEANT	Hold on a second.
M	SERGEANT	Here we go. Says here you're not expected until tomorrow.
M	MARSHAL	Never expect the expected Sergeant. Secure this place.
M	MARSHAL	One man here. Two more outside the front door. Everyone else on the perimeter, in teams of two.
M	MARSHAL	It's a caffeine kinda night fellas. Eyes open.
M	SERGEANT	Hey Doyle!
M	SERGEANT	Go take a look at the breaker on the ventilation system, will ya?
M	MARSHAL	Gotta pee.
F	CAT	Unbutton your shirt.
M	RIZZO	What...?
F	CAT	Now.
M	RIZZO	Who the hell are you?
F	CAT	Not room service.
M	COPS	Drop it!!
M	MARSHAL	Drop it, Joe!!!!!
M	MARSHAL	I didn't do it!
M	COPS	Drop it!!!!
M	COPS	On the floor!
M	MARSHAL	Call a bus!
M	MARSHAL	Guys! I didn't do it!!!
M	MARSHAL 1	Ambulance on the way!
M	MARSHAL	He's gone.
M	SERGEANT	Search the place!
M	ON CAT	
M	CLOSE ON CAT	
M	CORONER	What the fuck?
M	MARSHAL	Holy shit! Call Ross.
M	MARSHAL	Agent Ross?
M	ROSS	Where is he?
M	MARSHAL	At the hospital.
M	ROSS	Let's go.
F	CAT	I shouldn't drink.
M	SERGEANT	No you shouldn't.
F	CAT	I'm so so sorry.
M	SERGEANT	Tell it to the judge at your hearing in ten days.
F	CAT	What's going on out there?
M	SERGEANT	Nothing. Fill out the forms and you can go.
F	CAT	Really?
M	SERGEANT	Really. We need to get things organized. But don't worry, the judge will send you back, for sure.
F	CAT	I probably deserve it.
M	ROSS	Same handwriting. Same flower. It's him. Let's see the location.
M	SERGEANT	You're lucky no one was hurt.
F	CAT	I would have never forgiven myself.
M	REPORTERS	Is it Rizzo? Was it an assassination? Are there any clues? Is it true a Marshal did it?
M	ROSS	No comment.
M	ROSS	You didn't lock it down?
M	MARSHAL	It was after the fact. I didn't think...
M	ROSS	Do it. Now. No one in or out.
M	MARSHAL	OK! That's it. No one in or out! Lock down!
M	ROSS	I want to see paper on everyone in and out of the station in the last twenty four hours.
M	ROSS	And I want the tapes from the security cameras.
M	EMILIO	Are we good?
F	CAT	We're good.
M	EMILIO	When are you back?
F	CAT	Day after.
M	EMILIO	I have something.
F	CAT	The morning after OK?
M	EMILIO	Can't wait to see you Cara.
F	CAT	Say hello to Mama.
M	EMILIO	Mama says hello back.
M	ROSS V.O.	See?
M	ROSS	He tilted the camera just enough so the angle would catch the guard, not who was holding him.
M	ROSS	Twenty two murders in four years all with the same M.O. The word, the flower. He's sending a message, for sure. And I'm beginning to think it's not to us.
M	AGENT 1	But we're the only ones with the information.
M	ROSS	And we're not getting anywhere with it, are we?
M	ROSS	If the message is not for us, let's make sure the one it's intended for gets it. I want you to put it out to the press. Splash it across every newspaper, every magazine. National. I want eyeballs on it coast to coast. Monitor it. Let's see if anything comes back.
M	MARCO	Mr. Richard...
M	MARCO	Been a long time.
M	RICHARD	Yes it has Marco. How's the hand?
M	MARCO	Only hurts when it's humid.
M	RICHARD	Should've let us relocate you to Arizona instead of New Orleans.
M	MARCO	The Boss likes it humid.
M	RICHARD	There it is then.
M	MARCO	He's waiting for you.
M	RICHARD	Hello Luis.
M	DON LUIS	Hello Mr. Richard.
M	RICHARD	I brought you the morning paper.
M	DON LUIS	I've seen it.
M	RICHARD	And...?
M	DON LUIS	Coincidence.
M	RICHARD	Coincidence? Twenty two times? A flower that only grows in one place on earth? That used to be the calling card of...what was his name? Your former partner? The one who did your wet work?
M	DON LUIS	Fabio. Fabio Maria Restrepo. But I don't understand? Why come here with this?
M	RICHARD	Because when we find the end of a string we like to know where it begins.
M	DON LUIS	String? Now we are talking about string? I'm not a tailor.
M	RICHARD	Don Luis. Let's cut to the chase here, OK? When the Agency extracted your ass from Colombia fifteen years ago, and set you up here, we let you resume your business when what we should have done was lock you up for life. In exchange, you were supposed to keep the information flowing.
M	DON LUIS	And I have.
M	RICHARD	Not much, and not for a very long time.
M	DON LUIS	And this is what you traveled all the way down here to tell me?
M	RICHARD	No. What I traveled all the way down here to tell you, is there's a limit to our patience. The CIA is not an amusement park. There are no free rides. Everyone pays their way. And you, my friend, have not.
M	DON LUIS	OK OK. What would you want?
M	DON LUIS	I had nothing to do with this. I swear.
M	RICHARD	Then find out who does.
M	RICHARD	And Don Luis, don't play the innocent with us. It won't sit well with my bosses if we find out you had anything to do with this. Have a good day.
M	DON LUIS	She's talking to us.
M	MARCO	It could be anyone.
M	DON LUIS	Idiot! I told you. Everyone dead. Down to the dog.
M	DON LUIS (CONT'D)	You screwed up the first time. Now go fix it. Find her. Before she finds us.
M	ROSS V.O.	Since each and every one of the victims was a professional bad apple...
M	ROSS V.O.	We've narrowed motive down to payback or preemptive.
M	ROSS	Rizzo here...
M	ROSS	The most recent, was done to keep him from talking. Alexa Milshinova...
M	ROSS	...made a career of getting intimate with big stakes gamblers out of Vegas and then taking them off and sending them to meet their maker. D'Angelo James...
M	ROSS	...tried to take over the heroin trade in Houston from...
M	ROSS	The Gemini cartel. Their crimes are self explanatory, if you can read. Now I know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother. And since there's no collateral damage, why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case? And since until now, there has never been a clue to go on, why go on? But with this last killing...
M	ROSS	We have one. As we go to the video tape.
M	ROSS	We can't see the assassin, but we can see...
M	ROSS	The time. 2 AM. Which means our perp was in the station at...I don't have to spell it out for you.
M	ROSS	These are the names, phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two AM. Cops, criminals, clerks, janitors. Everyone. One of them is our target. I want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder you've been given. I want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives. Run down every lead. Check out every story. Our killer is out there. And we're going to find him. Before he kills again.
M	VOICE	Don't move.
M	VOICE	Take off your shirt.
M	DANNY	Do I have to?
M	VOICE	Now.
M	VOICE	Turn around.
F	CAT	Hello Danny.
M	DANNY	Hello Jennifer.
M	DANNY	You should have called.
F	CAT	Why?
M	DANNY	I could have been out.
F	CAT	I have a key.
M	DANNY	I could have been late.
F	CAT	I've got nowhere to go.
M	DANNY	It's just...
F	CAT	Just what?
M	DANNY	You show up whenever you want to...
F	CAT	And then we have the most incredible sex. Ever.
M	DANNY	I know. I'm just saying...
M	DANNY	Wouldn't you like to go to dinner sometime?
F	CAT	Uh-uh. This taste good enough.
M	DANNY	Or a movie?
F	CAT	No. They put me to sleep.
M	DANNY	So let's pop in a DVD and you can spend the night here?
F	CAT	Would you like the key back?
M	DANNY	No. I just want to get...I don't know...
F	CAT	Closer?
M	DANNY	Yes. Closer.
F	CAT	Is this close enough?
M	DANNY	...Yes.
M	DANNY	Jen...?
M	EMILIO	Safe?
F	CAT	On my end. You?
M	EMILIO	Safe.
F	CAT	What do we have?
M	EMILIO	You remember the guy who was in the news for running that Ponzi scheme about a year ago?
M	EMILIO	He disappeared fifty billion dollars. The money was never recovered. Skipped out and bought himself citizenship on some shit hole of a Caribbean island that calls itself a country with no extradition laws. Lot of very pissed off people lost everything.
M	EMILIO	There's something else.
M	EMILIO	How long has this been going on?
F	CAT	Not long.
M	EMILIO	The paper says twenty two. All like this. Tell me why.
F	CAT	No reason.
M	EMILIO	Since you're a kid, you don't do anything for no reason. Don't play dumb, it insults me.
F	CAT	I've got to get ready.
M	EMILIO	It's not just you in this. It's me, Mama.
F	CAT	Tio. You're removed. You book the work, you collect the fees...
M	EMILIO	I watch your ass. Each and every job, I vet, I double vet. For every one I book you, I turn down five, ten. I promised to keep you safe. I KEEP YOU SAFE. Cataleya. It's a full time job, no matter what you think. Those pictures...they freaked me out. OK? I didn't realize...
F	CAT	I come to you at nine. I say I want to be a killer. What kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind. I live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter. Stop playing the innocent with me. You know this. Forever.
M	EMILIO	Sure. Of course. But the way you're playing it. They even have a name for you. The Tag killer. I would have stopped it a long time ago. Had I known about this.
F	CAT	Why?
M	EMILIO	Because I love you.
F	CAT	If you do, you would never have let me get involved in the first place.
F	CAT	I love you too.
M	ROSS	OK. Let's try...organization...
M	ROSS	Fuck...
F	CAT	Hi guys.
F	CAT	Hey! Hey!
F	CAT	OK. OK. Now sit.
F	CAT	Now let's see what good boys you can be.
F	CAT	Top cut sirloin.
F	CAT	Nice, huh?
F	CAT	Red, juicy, delicious.
F	CAT	Stay.
F	CAT	Good boys. Eat.
M	PEPE	Hola Cataleya.
F	CAT	Hola Pepe. I guess the boys gave me away.
M	PEPE	Anyone else? The barking would only have stopped when their screaming began. You spoil them.
F	CAT	I train them.
M	PEPE	If that's what you want to call it.
M	PEPE	Did you get the beans I like?
F	CAT	Of course.
M	PEPE	And the salsa Verde?
F	CAT	And the salsa Verde.
M	PEPE	Not the one in the short bottle.
F	CAT	The long one.
M	PEPE	I hate that other one, the chili they use sucks. Did you see your uncle?
F	CAT	Of course.
M	PEPE	We're going to church for Easter.
F	CAT	As always.
M	PEPE	And you?
F	CAT	Not this year.
M	PEPE	As always. You should, you know.
F	CAT	I should do a lot of things.
M	PEPE	You could start with that one. It would make us very happy.
F	CAT	Maybe next year.
M	PEPE	Cataleya. No one knows what happens tomorrow, next year is a long time away. How was your trip?
F	CAT	Rewarding.
M	PEPE	Passport?
F	CAT	Your ears are better than my eyes.
M	PEPE	You work too much. I keep telling that to Emilio. The girl should have a life while she is still young enough to enjoy it. You should take a vacation. Go some place warm. With a nice beach.
F	CAT	Good idea.
M	WILLIAM	GRRRAAAHHHH!!!!
M	WILLIAM	Hey! I pay to see more, not less.
M	WILLIAM	That's better.
M	GIRL	Willie you are such a perv.
M	WILLIAM	I know. Anyone hungry?
M	GIRL	Always!
M	WILLIAM	Lunch is served.
M	SERVANT	For you sir.
M	WILLIAM	Where did this come from?
M	SERVANT	It was in the post box this morning.
M	GIRL	Here fishy fishy!
M	GIRL	Willie! They're ignoring me!
M	WILLIAM	Put a drop of blood in there and they'll be your biggest admirers. All the way down to your stripped clean bones. And speaking of stripped...
M	WILLIAM	Bedtime!
M	WILLIAM	Bring extra security in for the night.
M	HEAD SECURITY	Yes sir.
M	WILLIAM	And make sure we're shut down tight.
M	HEAD SECURITY	Yes sir. Have a good night, sir.
M	WILLIAM	I intend to.
M	HEAD SECURITY	There are already guys in the garden and guys out back. I want you three upstairs, two on the roof. You three downstairs. Follow me.
M	WILLIAM	Hello?
M	WILLIAM	Anybody?
F	CAT	Stop right there.
M	WILLIAM	Who are you?
F	CAT	Doesn't matter who I am.
M	WILLIAM	What do you want?
F	CAT	I want you exactly where you are.
M	WILLIAM	ARRRGGGHHHH!
M	WILLIAM	Whatever they paid you, I'll double it!
F	CAT	You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers.
M	WILLIAM	Please. I'll give you anything you want. Don't kill me!
F	CAT	I'm not going to kill you. They are.
M	WILLIAM	Please! Please!
M	WILLIAM	Please! Help! Help!
M	RICHARD	I can't believe this.
M	RICHARD	Yes?
M	VOICE	Mr. Steven Richard?
M	RICHARD	Who is this?
M	ROSS	FBI special agent Jack Ross. I'm lead agent on a case. A serial killer we call the tag killer.
M	RICHARD	I've seen the publicity.
M	ROSS	Marks his victims with a flower. From Colombia. A Cataleya orchid.
M	ROSS (CONT'D)	When I try to access information, I get stuck with a CIA Access denied folder. I understand you were the station chief down there when this rash of murders with the same MO...
M	RICHARD	Listen, Agent Ross, we don't give out any type of information over the phone. So what I suggest is you file a formal request with the agency for any information you might want. And I'll be more than happy to get back to you as soon as I can.
M	ROSS	Thank you.
M	MARCO	Bueno?
M	RICHARD	No more bullshitting me Marco. I've got the FBI on my ass now. I want that problem taken care of. Yesterday. Do you hear me?
M	MARCO	Loud and clear.
M	PULL BACK TO	
M	ROSS	Where are we?
M	AGENT 1	We ID'd everyone who came in and out of the police station for the twenty four hours preceding the incident. The only one that we could not verify was a...
M	AGENT 1	Valarie Phillips. Picked up for drunk driving four hours before the hit on Rizzo.
M	ROSS	A woman? Are you sure?
M	AGENT 1	It's our only lead.
M	ROSS	Let's see her booking report. Well, there was a little problem. Seems she was too drunk to get a photo.
M	ROSS	But not to get prints.
M	AGENT 1	We ran the prints in the data base. No match was found.
M	ROSS	Lovely. So if there is no booking record, how did we get the name?
M	AGENT 1	A library card. The only ID she had was a library card.
M	ROSS	I don't believe this.
M	AGENT 1	There are the surveillance tapes.
M	AGENT 2	From three angles.
M	ROSS	Well, let's see them.
M	ROSS	That's it?
M	AGENT 1	That's it.
M	ROSS	It's not a lot to go on. But put them in the data base and let's see what matches.
M	ROSS	...a woman.
M	MARCO	Hello Eduardo, que pasa?
M	EDUARDO	I have fifty bucks on this shot. That's what's que pasa.
M	MARCO	Hey sorry. Come on.
M	MARCO	Here. For you.
M	EDUARDO	For what?
M	MARCO	First for fucking up your shot. Second, for an address. You remember Fabio? The Cataleya Killer?
M	EDUARDO	It's a long time. My memory...
M	MARCO	You went to school with his brother in law. What was his name? Emilio?
M	EDUARDO	Like I said...my memory...
M	MARCO	I have a problem. And we think Fabio's kid is behind it.
M	EDUARDO	Look Marco. I gotta be honest with you. Everyone knows you guys were playing a double game, and when the shit went down, you were the only ones who got out of it clean.
M	MARCO	So you do have a memory.
M	EDUARDO	Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck out, and let me take my shot.
M	MARCO	
M	MARCO	Fuck...
M	MARCO	You don't tell me what I want to know by the count of three, you scum sucking lowlife prick, your memory will be permanently disabled. One...two...
F	CAT	I brought you something.
M	DANNY	That's real progress. Let's see.
M	DANNY	Wow! Just what I always wanted.
F	CAT	You're making fun.
M	DANNY	No. No. I mean, a gift from you. Something to show me you're thinking of me as more than your boy toy.
F	CAT	Well, there's that too.
M	DANNY	Wait.
F	CAT	You don't want me?
M	DANNY	Of course I do. But can't we talk a little first?
F	CAT	What would you like to talk about?
M	DANNY	Oh, I don't know. Nothing. Anything.
F	CAT	You really want to do this?
M	DANNY	Yes, I do.
F	CAT	OK.
M	DANNY	So...what's new?
F	CAT	Nothing much.
M	DANNY	Where have you been?
F	CAT	On vacation.
M	DANNY	Really? Where?
F	CAT	Down south.
M	DANNY	Where there are alligators?
F	CAT	There was that one.
M	DANNY	Was it nice?
F	CAT	It was OK.
M	DANNY	What did you do?
F	CAT	Nothing much. A little swimming, fed the fish.
M	DANNY	OK. Now you.
F	CAT	Now me what?
M	DANNY	Conversation. It goes two ways.
F	CAT	OK. Want to fuck?
M	DANNY	OK. OK. I get it. You want to protect yourself. I understand. But I'm...I don't just want to be here for the sex. I know a lot of guys would think this is perfect. She comes over, we fuck like mad. She leaves. But I need a little more.
F	CAT	Like what?
M	DANNY	Like...uh...some trust maybe.
F	CAT	That's a hard one for me.
M	DANNY	I got that. I'm not in a hurry. And just so you know. The past? If it's too painful right now? If you can't talk about? That's OK. But, you know, if someone hurt you before...like a broken heart or something. I'm not responsible for that. I just want want to be here for you. To know a little about what's inside. What you feel. Just a little.
F	CAT	I'm lonely sometimes.
M	DANNY	...And?
F	CAT	Isn't that enough?
M	DANNY	It's a good start.
M	DANNY	Now we can have sex.
M	DANNY	Let me this time.
M	DANNY	Morning.
M	DANNY	I didn't know if you like your eggs over easy or scrambled, so I made...
M	DANNY	Wait...
F	CAT	I shouldn't have done this.
M	DANNY	Done what?
F	CAT	Any of it.
M	DANNY	Why?
F	CAT	Because.
M	DANNY	Can we talk about it?
M	Pulls on her top.	
F	CAT	We already talked. I'm late.
M	DANNY	I made breakfast.
F	CAT	I don't like eggs.
F	CAT	Now you know something else about me.
F	CAT	Don't come out. Please. Don't.
F	CAT	Sorry I'm late.
M	EMILIO	You said you would stop the writing!
M	EMILIO	Read this!
M	EMILIO	Seven people slaughtered in a Miami bar. I knew one of them. Years ago, in school.
F	CAT	So what?
M	EMILIO	I don't like it. This is getting too close.
F	CAT	Tio. Could be anyone. You're seeing things that aren't there.
M	EMILIO	And you are so blinded by your need for revenge that you are not seeing things that are. The handwriting is on the wall Cara. Let me read it to you. This is over. I will no longer accept jobs. I will no longer solicit jobs. You are retired.
F	CAT	How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death? How many? And you're going to give me a lecture about revenge?
M	EMILIO	Cara. It's time to get a life, before you run out of time. Here.
M	EMILIO	Maybe this will help you understand what I am telling you.
M	ON CAT	
M	VOICE	Five six. Brown eyes, hazel really, dark hair, thick, shiny...
M	DANNY	Great body, killer smile. And I think about her all day long.
M	RYAN	Dude, you're in love.
M	DANNY	You're so smart.
M	RYAN	Seriously. This comes from the heart. OK? You're nuts. The girl comes over, strips down, rocks your world, gets dressed, asks for nothing. Leaves. The only thing she doesn't do is bring the pizza and beer. You are living my dream. And you want to go and fuck it up with love?
M	DANNY	I knew you were the perfect guy to talk about this with.
M	RYAN	Hey come on. It's me. Since first grade. You and me?
M	DANNY	Ryan, I'm twenty eight. I met someone who I want to be with. All the time. I have nothing. A stuffed animal. And a picture.
M	RYAN	You have a picture?
M	DANNY	In my phone.
M	RYAN	Give it up!
M	DANNY	It's not even a whole picture. I took it while she was asleep.
M	RYAN	Whoa...total babe-age! When do I meet the future Mrs. Delaney?
M	DANNY	Haven't you been listening to me? I don't even know how to get in touch with her.
M	RYAN	Dude. That is such a no brainer.
F	SHARI	You know, if you weren't my brother's best friend...
M	RYAN	You're doing it for love Shari. Not for me. When they walk down the aisle, you can say you were the one made it happen.
M	DANNY	Maybe I shouldn't... Up to you Danny. I do it all the time. Photo goes in here. Bangs around the National Data base looking for a match. Bingo. Address, phone number, shoe size, dress size, rap sheet, anything you want to know. It's really no big deal.
M	DANNY	I just feel like, maybe, I'm invading her privacy or something.
F	SHARI	Hey guys, I haven't got all day. Yes or no?
M	RYAN	Of course yes.
M	ROSS	I want a trace put on an incoming transmission!
M	As everyone is exiting...	
F	MAMA	Cara. You will come home for lunch.
F	CAT	No Mama. One thing at a time.
F	MAMA	That was such a nice surprise.
M	PEPE	I knew it would happen.
M	EMILIO	Everyone grows up.
F	MAMA	I think she's going to be OK.
M	EMILIO	I think so.
M	TECH	We need a common base, so let's try size...
M	TECH	Good...now let's see...hands...
M	TECH	Looking good. And now...
M	TECH	Nice nose.
M	TECH	That's your girl.
M	DANNY	Hello? It's me.
M	DANNY	Oh my god! I can't believe it! Hello you.
F	CAT	Are you busy?
M	DANNY	No. I...no.
F	CAT	I was just sitting here, looking out the window. And I thought...where are you?
M	DANNY	In my apartment. Looking out the window.
F	CAT	So we're seeing the same sky.
M	DANNY	Yes. I'm so happy to hear your voice.
F	CAT	And I'm happy to hear yours.
M	ROSS	We got her! I want SWAT there! All of them! Now!
M	DANNY	You know it's so crazy. I was just sitting here, looking at your picture, thinking "I'd wish I could call her." And you called.
F	CAT	...What picture?
M	DANNY	I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have. But I have nothing to remember you by, except this little stuffed...
F	CAT	What picture Danny???
M	DANNY	I took a picture of you while you were sleeping. With my phone.
M	DANNY	Jen. I'm sorry. Really. I didn't mean to offend you.
M	DANNY	...it's just you looked so cute. I can erase it if you want. It's not even a good picture...Jen?
F	CAT	Who else saw the picture?
M	DANNY	Nobody. My friend Ryan...
F	CAT	Who else?
M	DANNY	His sister. I didn't want to..it's just...I wanted to contact you. I wanted to...
F	CAT	What does the sister of Ryan have to do with this?
M	DANNY	Shari, that's Ryan's sister...she works at Police headquarters...
M	DANNY	I just wanted to be...
F	CAT	Closer. I know. Goodbye Danny.
M	SWAT 1	Shower.
M	GUY	Hey! FBI...
M	AGENT 1	No ma'am everything is under control. We just need you to stay inside. May we have a look around?
M	ROSS	She's not here. Lock the building down!
M	ROSS	Where the hell did she go?
M	ROSS	No one in or out! Lock this place down! Anyone?
M	AGENT 1	Nothing here.
M	AGENT 2	Nothing here.
M	ROSS V.O.	Anything?
M	AGENT 1	Nothing...wait...one security camera down.
M	AGENT 1	The second one is down.
M	ROSS	Where?
M	AGENT 1	The garage!
M	ROSS	All units! Converge on the garage. Cover every exit!
M	ROSS	Look under every car. In every trunk!!!
F	CAT	I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry
M	OPERATOR	Federal Bureau of Investigation. How may I direct your call?
F	CAT	I'd like to speak to the agent in charge of the TAG killings.
M	ROSS	Agent Ross. Hello? Hello?
F	CAT	This won't take long. Hands up.
F	CAT	Turn around.
F	CAT	Sit.
M	ROSS	Just so you know, all this? Being so smart? Covering all your bases? It's not going to matter. It's already over. The whole place is wired with web cams.
F	CAT	You mean these?
F	CAT	Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore.
F	CAT	I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me.
F	CAT	This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you.
M	ROSS	So what happened?
F	CAT	He did.
F	CAT	This is the last time I was happy.
M	CAT (CONT'D)	The next day they were dead. He killed them.
M	ROSS	And all this? All these clues...they weren't for us. They were for him.
F	CAT	I didn't know how else to find him.
M	ROSS	And you figured sooner or later we would make this public.
F	CAT	It took you a long time.
M	ROSS	You're very patient.
F	CAT	What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them.
M	ROSS	You sent him a message. He sent you one back.
F	CAT	And now I want to finish it.
M	ROSS	I can't help you.
F	CAT	Yes you can. He's protected by your government.
M	ROSS	By a part of the government I have no way of reaching. It's CIA. I don't know why. But there's no getting through it, under it, around it, believe me, I've tried.
F	CAT	You're going to have to try harder.
F	CAT	I found this on your table inside. Your family, right?
F	CAT	Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice.
F	CAT	I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years.
M	ROSS	Wait...
M	ROSS	What about...?
F	CAT	When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work.
M	RICHARD	You understand, I only agreed to this meeting out of professional courtesy.
M	RICHARD (CONT'D)	The President wanting us to reach out to you folks on the domestic side, and all that pie in the sky crap. The truth is, I really can't help you at all.
M	ROSS	Can't or won't.
M	RICHARD	Same thing really.
M	ROSS	Look, let's put all our cards on the table here. I've met this woman. The killer.
M	RICHARD	Really? Where?
M	ROSS	My apartment. She trapped me. She told me if I did not get her this man.
M	ROSS	She will kill a member of my family every day until I have none.
M	RICHARD	You're kidding me?
M	ROSS	Do I look like I could make something like that up?
M	ROSS	So? What should I do now?
M	RICHARD	I'd go to the police. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting...
M	ROSS	Ross. It's her. She says you either give her what she wants or she is going to redecorate your office.
M	ROSS	Bright red.
M	RICHARD	What does she think this is? Amateur hour? Tell her that glass is tempered to resist a direct hit by a fifty seven millimeter ordinance.
M	ROSS	She says she's using seven point six two steel jacketed armor piercing shells. And you have ten seconds to give her the address.
M	RICHARD	How can I be sure once she has the address she won't kill me anyway?
M	ROSS	You can't. But I can assure you that if you don't give her the address you will be number twenty four on her hit parade. Trust me on this one.
M	RICHARD	Eight seven six Magnolia Terrace... New Orleans.
M	ROSS	She asked you to keep this conversation strictly confidential.
M	RICHARD	With pleasure.
M	ROSS	Thank you. Because honestly I didn't know how I was going to explain you splattered all over your walls.
F	CAT	You guys ever been to New Orleans?
F	CAT	Good morning.
F	CAT	I didn't know if you took sugar and cream, so I got one of each.
M	SMITH	Who are you?
F	CAT	You designed the house at eight seven six Magnolia.
M	SMITH	You either leave immediately young lady or I am going to call the police.
F	CAT	I would love to see the plans of this house.
M	MARCO	You will take up positions here...
M	MARCO	And here. And here. You must expect the unexpected. She is like mist under a door, like a mouse in the wall. She will never attack straight on. You will not see her, until it is too late. She is that invisible.
M	MARCO	We would prefer she be taken alive. But with a bitch like this, if you get a kill shot you take it.
M	DON LUIS	Marco?
M	DON LUIS	MARCO!
M	MARCO	You four! Get the armored Mercedes! We have to get Don Luis out of here!
M	MARCO	Don Luis! This way! Everyone to their positions!
M	THUG	OK! Everyone in!
M	MARCO	Don Luis! You hide here.
M	MARCO	Wait for my call. Either she is dead, or we have her far enough away so you can make it to the garage. Take the van. The armor is so thick nothing short of an atomic bomb can penetrate it.
M	DON LUIS	Marco. Thank you.
M	MARCO	That's the first time you ever said that.
M	DON LUIS	Said what?
M	MARCO	Thank you.
M	DON LUIS	Don't get used to it.
M	MARCO	Down!
M	MARCO	Go!
M	MARCO	Now!
M	MARCO	Outside!
M	MARCO	Kill her!
M	MARCO	Checking.
M	MARCO	I think we got her.
M	DON LUIS	Did you see the body?
M	DON LUIS	Marco??
M	MARCO	Stay where you are!
M	MARCO	You know what bitch? I loved killing your father. He was a coward! And you know what else? I screwed your mother behind your father's back! We all did! She couldn't get enough of it! The whore! I killed her! I killed him! You want to avenge them? The whore and the coward? That's what you come from! Come out! I'm here! Come get the bullet with your name on it, Bitch!
M	MARCO	Kill her!
M	DON LUIS	Marco! Marco!
M	MARCO	You two here! That door opens...
M	MARCO	...kill anything that comes through.
M	MARCO	Shit!
M	MARCO	Giorgio?
M	MARCO	Tonino?
M	DON LUIS	Marco! What the hell's going on???
M	MARCO	Hold on.
M	MARCO	I will hold here! Run! Run!
M	MARCO	Do it! Do it you bitch! Isn't this the moment you've been waiting for?
F	CAT	Yes, it is.
M	DON LUIS	I beat you bitch! You can't kill me! I am unkillable!
M	DON LUIS	Marco?
F	CAT	It's Cataleya.
M	DON LUIS	I don't understand you. You should have been dead a long time ago. You got lucky. You escaped. You were given a second chance at a life. Why did you not take it? Why did you involve yourself with this insanity?
F	CAT	For something you can never understand. The love I had for my parents. And you killed that.
M	DON LUIS	And because of that, you have ruined your whole life to try to kill me? You stupid bitch. Don't you get it? Someone like me? I cannot be killed. I do the killing. Not the other way around. And now it is your turn to be hunted. You will never find me. But as day follows night, believe me, I will find you. And I will kill you. And you know why? Because I will never be where you can kill me. I will never be where you want me to be.
F	CAT	Actually Don Luis...you are exactly where I want you to be.
F	CAT	EAT!
M	ROSS V.O.	I want you to think hard...
M	ROSS	Was there anything else?
M	DANNY	I already told you everything. She would come over, we'd have amazing sex, and she would leave. It's really late, and I'm really tired, if you're not going to arrest me...
M	ROSS	We don't really have anything to charge you with.
M	DANNY	Then can I go?
M	ROSS	Just a few more questions.
M	DANNY	Can I have a cup of coffee?
M	ROSS	Sure.
M	DANNY	Hello?
M	CAT V.O.	Hello Danny.
M	DANNY	Jen...I...uh...I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...are you OK?
M	CAT V.O.	I'm fine.
M	CAT V.O.	Where are you?
M	DANNY	FBI headquarters. I didn't tell them anything...besides...
M	CAT V.O.	That I would come over and we would have amazing sex. Your phone is tapped, you know that?
M	DANNY	I know.
M	CAT V.O.	You have forty seconds before they pick up on this. Gives you the time for three questions. OK...What's your real name?
M	CAT V.O.	...Cataleya.
M	DANNY	Like the flower.
M	CAT V.O.	Twenty seconds.
M	DANNY	Will I ever see you again?
F	CAT	I know where to find you.
M	AGENT 1	Ross. We're picking something up off that kid's phone.
M	DANNY	If there is ever a chance. I want you to know...I could love you. If you let me.
M	CAT V.O.	Last question.
M	DANNY	...I love you.
M	ROSS	Cataleya? Cataleya!
