M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CIVIL SERVANT	Monitoring. All the usual.
F	MALCOLM	How did your team do at the weekend?
M	CIVIL SERVANT	Yeah, alright. We won.
F	MALCOLM	Great. Wanker.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	Sam. Morning.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	Well, pop pickers....what Shall we start with today? Wonky Ron....or Simon Foster, on the PM programme for the BBC. Malcolm starts listening to the recording of Simon on the
M	EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO)	Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster, the Minister for International development. Thank you for joining us.
F	MALCOLM	Here we go.
M	EDDIE MAIR	You've been in the job now for eighteen months, do you think you're making headway?
M	SIMON	Ah. Yes I do. You'd expect me to say that I suppose.
F	JUDY	Mark, are you co-ordinating that millenium goals press release?
M	MARK	Yes.
F	JUDY	Well co-ordinate it better.
M	MARK	Yes, can do.
F	JUDY	Is that the Minister? Bloody nail - has anyone got a nail file?
M	SIMON	Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night's interview?
F	JUDY	No not yet. SIMON Perhaps he didn't hear it.
F	JUDY	Or maybe he's dead.
M	SIMON	He might be dead. He might have had that massive stroke we've all been waiting for. It's in the post.
M	SIMON (ON RADIO)	...preventable sickness in many of the poorest countries round the world....and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which is a major, major issue.... Page 2
F	MALCOLM	Diarrhoea? I mean, this is the minister for International Development. He should be talking about food parcels, not fucking arse-spraying mayhem.
M	SIMON (ON RADIO)	And so if we can tackle the easy things, like diarrhoea, then we can.....
F	MALCOLM	Oh yes, say it again. Very good. What is this, The Shitting Forecast? ...and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases.
M	EDDIE MAIR	You mentioned the word `war"
F	MALCOLM	Steady Eddie... Against preventable diseases, yes....
M	EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO)	Yes. All the evidence now points to a US military intervention in the Middle East. Is that you view?
M	SIMON (ON RADIO)	Well....personally, I think that war is unforseeable.
F	MALCOLM	Sam! Sam!
M	EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO)	Unforseeable?
M	SIMON (ON RADIO)	Yes.
F	MALCOLM	NO YOU DO NOT THINK THAT! Sam! I'm going to have to go over to International Development, and pull Simon Foster's fucking hair.
F	MALCOLM	He did not say "unforseeable'. You may have heard him say it, but he did not say that, and that is a fact.
F	JUDY	He'll want you to row back from the `unforeseeable' thing on Question Time tonight.
M	SIMON	On Question Time, you know the funny question they always ask at the end?
F	JUDY	Yes?
M	SIMON	I think we should prep that now. I'd like to shine on the funny question, cos I'm a funny guy. With a light touch.
F	JUDY	There's this guy, he's a property tycoon. He's bought a South Sea Island. It might be something like that, you know. "If you had to spend the rest of your life on a desert island, who would it be with?"
M	SIMON	Ah. Well, I can't say my wife, because I haven't got one, and I can't say my girlfriend, because I haven't got one of those either.
F	JUDY	And don't say Mandela, that's...
M	SIMON	No. Boring. And a bloke.
F	JUDY	Or Keira Knightley.
M	SIMON	Well, that's a good idea. Page 4
F	JUDY	Pervert. Sex. Minister.
M	SIMON	I don't think so.
F	JUDY	People don't want to know.
F	SUZY	Did you take the washing out of the machine?
M	TOBY	No.
F	SUZY	What do you mean, no?
M	TOBY	No. I didn't take the washing out of the machine.
F	SUZY	It's going to go really stale.
M	TOBY	It'll be fine.
F	SUZY	It's not fine. By the time...
M	TOBY	It is fine. I'll wear stale pants.
F	SUZY	I don't want to go out with some who wears stale pants.
M	TOBY	Well, there we go. I could go commando, but I don't think that's acceptable in government.
F	SUZY	Please. So: got everything you need for your first day in International Development? Oh Yes. It's all here. My massive intellect. And an apple for Simon Foster.
F	SUZY	Simon Fluster.
M	TOBY	Don't say that, I'm rebranding him.
F	SUZY	Well he was crap on the radio last night. He sounded like a chicken with a wasp up its arse.
M	TOBY	Well I'm going to sort that out. After a week I'll have him sounding like a chicken without a wasp up its arse. SUZY Have a good day, good luck honey.
M	TOBY	Have a good day at the Foreign Office. Try not to annoy Russia.
F	SUZY	I'll give you a call later. Keep your phone on. Bye.
M	TOBY	Yeah, alright.
F	SUZY	Oh and be careful - cars!
M	TOBY	Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes, because you're starting to remind me of my mum. And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction.
F	SUZY	I'm just checking whether you put last night's lasagne in the fridge.
M	MICHAEL	Croissants!
F	MALCOLM	No. You're fine to go ahead and print that. It's lies, you'd be lying, but go ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No he did not. Oh, just before you go -- when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference...would email be better? Or a phone call? Or, hey I know, I'll write it on a cake, "Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the new baby" in those little silver balls. (BEAT) Yeah, maybe
M	TOBY	No, it's fine, it's in the fridge. I put some clingfilm over it. In the FO office, Michael switches on some classical
F	SUZY	Why did you put clingfilm on it?
M	TOBY	To keep it fresh.
F	SUZY	It's in the fridge, that'll keep it fresh.
M	TOBY	No, but it still might dry out.
F	MALCOLM	Yeah, Malcolm Tucker. Can I speak to James Lewis at the PM Programme please? Page 7
M	MICHAEL	Still slightly warm. That's how I like my women as well.
F	SUZY	Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby.
M	TOBY	No it isn't. That's a myth. Clingfilm is perfectly safe.
F	MALCOLM	No, I'll hold,. what's he waiting for? A sex-change?
M	TOBY	They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer. Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer. And Lasagne doesn't give you syphillis.
F	MALCOLM	James! Right --Simon Foster? Yeah, very funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody. Listen, we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow, OK? (getting annoyed) No, YOU relax. Tell you what, I'll come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown. GET ME FUCKING BRIAN!
M	SIMON	Paris Hilton?
F	JUDY	Are you serious?
M	SIMON	Lily Allen.
F	JUDY	No. No women. Page 8
M	SIMON	The Olson twins?
F	JUDY	Hi. Right. I see.
M	SIMON	What?
F	JUDY	Malcolm's coming to see you.
M	SIMON	Shit. He's still alive. When's he due? Malcolm walks in with Toby sheepishly behind him.
F	MALCOLM	Now. And don't say you weren't prepared because I rang ahead. Give us a minute, will you love?
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	In the words of the late, great Nat King Fucking Cole, `Unforeseeable, that's what you are..'
F	JUDY	So you're...whatever your name is, Dan, the new advisor? Daniel.
M	TOBY	Toby.
F	JUDY	Right. Just most of you lot tend to be called Dan, or Danny, so it's always worth a punt. OK, hello. As you know, I'm Judy Molloy, Civil Service Director of Communications for International Development.
M	TOBY	Is this a normal morning, or...?
F	JUDY	Okay, I've got a meeting in two minutes. And the minister was rubbish in last night's interview.
M	TOBY	Rubbish?
F	JUDY	It's a technical term. It means he went on the radio and everyone could hear that he was rubbish.
M	MALCOLM [IN OFFICE]	You sounded like a panicky chimp trapped in a washing machine.
M	SIMON	Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a personal opinion.
F	MALCOLM	Oh why didn't you say? I mean, he asked you. Fuck. Of course, that explains it. Yeah. Say, if he'd asked you to fucking black up, or give him your PIN number, or shot yourself, would you have done that as well.
M	SIMON	I would have blacked up. It was the radio and no-one would have known.
F	MALCOLM	Yeah. Very good.
M	SIMON	But war is -- basically unforeseeable isn't it?
F	MALCOLM	That is not our line, alright? Walk the fucking line. Look. Page 10 We've got Karen Clark over from Washington, okay? We've got the US National Security Advisor's main guy coming. Yeah? We've got enough Pentagon goons here for a fucking coup d'etat. This is not the time to send out a signal like this in some personal fucking sodcast.
F	JUDY	Minister, this is Toby.
F	MALCOLM	Not the time love. Fuck off.
M	SIMON	Hey Toby. Glad you could join us. Bit of an odd morning, but 'Welcome to the madhouse!'I apologise for Malcolm.
F	MALCOLM	Don't apologise for me. You should apologise for yourself. Did I not just tell you to fuck off and yet you're still here?
F	JUDY	That's correct.
F	MALCOLM	Hey, foetus boy. Lesson One: If I tell you to fuck off what do you do?
M	TOBY	Fuck off?
F	MALCOLM	You'll go far.Now fuck off.
M	TOBY	Right.
M	SIMON	We were thinking, weren't we Judy, that I could row back on Question Time tonight.
F	MALCOLM	No, You're not going on Question Time tonight. You've been disinvited. Page 11
M	SIMON	Why? We've been prepping Question Time.
F	MALCOLM	Because they ask fucking questions on Question Time. And you're no good at questions. If it was Fumbling, Off- Message Shit Fucking Answer Time, you'd be our main guy. But it's not.
F	JUDY	Sorry, why wasn't I told about this?
F	MALCOLM	Why should I tell you about this?
F	JUDY	Because it's a scheduled media appearance by this department's Secretary Of State and it therefore falls within my purview...
F	MALCOLM	Your purview? Where do you think you are sweetheart, in some Regency costume drama? This is a government department, not a fucking Jane Austen novel. Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.
F	JUDY	Malcolm, your swearing doesn't impress me. My husband works for Tower Hamlets and believe me, those kids make you sound like Angela Lansbury.
F	MALCOLM	She's married? The poor bastard.
M	SIMON	But...okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment.... Are you saying that I'm now not allowed to make any media appearances?
F	MALCOLM	No, not until we can trust you to keep to the line.
M	SIMON	But I was going to keep to the line: "I don't actually think war is unforeseeable."
F	MALCOLM	What is it then?
M	SIMON	Is it...I don't know? Foreseeable? No.
F	MALCOLM	No. Not foreseeable. That's fucking declaring war. Do you want to fucking declare war?
M	SIMON	I'm a cabinet minister. I didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance I ever had.
F	MALCOLM	Write this down. It's neither forseeable nor undorseeable.
M	SIMON	Right. So not inevitable, but not...evitable.
F	MALCOLM	Okay, you need to work on this fucking line. That includes you, Jane Fucking Austen with the strap-on. Oh, and put the sniff out there that the next time the BBC ambushes a Minister with a war question we'll drop a bomb on them.
F	JUDY	I can't do that. That's political, that's not in my...
F	MALCOLM	Purview, Marie Antoinette? Weel listen, darling, why don't you fucking scuttle off back to fucking Cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks. Let them eat cock! (TO TOBY) You, Ron Weasley -- you do it.
M	MICHAEL	You needn't worry about the Canadians. They're just happy to be there. (Pause) Yes, well, they always look surprised when they're invited.
F	SUZY	Listen, shall I just give Toby a quick call about the Simon Foster thing?
M	TOBY	Hiya. You do know this is the third time you've rung? Are you on a new tariff?
F	SUZY	So? How's it going? You found the bogs yet?
M	TOBY	All a bit manic. It was never like this at Agriculture. People tend not to swear so much about wheat. Apart from farmers. They swear about everything.
F	SUZY	Can you turn that down a bit? Look, I've got a leg up for you. I think we could get Simon into the big meeting with Karen Clark?
M	TOBY	Right - Karen Clark from...is that the woman who went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia?
F	SUZY	Karen Clark, US Assistant Secretary of State?
M	TOBY	Oh right. Shit. Karen Clark. Wow. Thanks.
F	SUZY	Hang on, Michael wants to say something.
M	MICHAEL	Meat.
F	SUZY	Meat.
M	MICHAEL	Meat! Simon's only going to be meat in the room. Don't get his hopes up.
F	SUZY	Yeah, so you know -- Simon, between us, he's just going to be meat in the room.
M	TOBY	Meat?
F	SUZY	Yeah. The Americans don't feel they're getting a real meeting unless there's thirty of you on each side. So Simon is...you know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical goods? Sort of one of those. But you might not want to tell him that. I ought to go. I love you.
M	TOBY	Likewise. Affirmative on that.
F	JUDY	So, quick tour.
M	TOBY	Page 15
F	JUDY	Over there...that's Mike's patch. Leave Mike to it. He knows what he's doing. Don't you Mike?
M	MIKE	What?
F	JUDY	Exactly. He's an idiot. He organised 3,000 tents and sanitation packs for Rwanda.
M	TOBY	Right...is that not...?
F	JUDY	They needed them in Luanda. Angola. It's been in the news. And that's the end of the tour. I've got to go.
M	TOBY	Look, I understand your hostility to new wood coming in..
F	JUDY	There's a lot of really important people you need to know about, but I haven't got time. TOBY Hey, boss.
M	SIMON	Toby, hi. Sorry about earlier -- Malcolm. He's a bit of an...alpha male, isn't he?
M	TOBY	Look, I've managed to get you into the big meeting at the Foreign Office this afternoon.
M	SIMON	The Karen Clark meeting? Shit, really? Sure. How did you...?
M	TOBY	I did it through sheer bloody hard work.
M	SIMON	Hey Judy.
F	JUDY	Hello?
M	SIMON	Tobes here has got me into the big Karen Clark meeting.
F	JUDY	Wow. Yeah, the Big Meet. How are you spelling that, by the way?
M	TOBY	Two `e's.
M	TOBY	Just, maybe, might be best not to get too excited. It might be that their guys muscle in and have the lion's share of the talk time.
F	JUDY	Yeah. It might be like that.
M	SIMON	I think I can work a room, okay? I'm not a room virgin.
M	MICHAEL	Simon.
M	SIMON	Michael.
M	CHAD	Ah, Michael? I'm Chad.
M	MICHAEL	Hello?
M	CHAD	We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon delegation. First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters.
F	SUZY	Right. CHAD Thanks so much.
M	MICHAEL	My God. Who was that, Young Lankenstein?
F	JUDY	Oh he'll be running something relatively major. They're all kids in Washington. It's like Bugsy Malone, but with real guns.
M	SIMON	No-one will hear me if I say anything. How's your view? Can we swap? Can I swap with you?
F	JUDY	I think the meeting's starting.
M	SIMON	Well, quickly then, swap.
F	KAREN	We all agree this is a very tough time, but I don't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point.
M	SIMON	Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit hardcore.
M	SIMON (CONT'D)	No, this is worse. Swap back.
F	KAREN	This paper, authored by one of my aides, Liza Weld. You don't mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza?
M	KAREN (CONT'D)	Illuminates the logistical factors we face. She highlights a number of reasons why, in practical terms, we can't envision a theatre deployment for twelve months.
M	BOB ADRIANO	Although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper.
F	KAREN	Really - such as what?
M	BOB ADRIANO	The committee feels a much quicker deployment is possible.
F	KAREN	Which committee?
M	BOB ADRIANO	This has been discussed in a number of committees. If I said one committee...
F	KAREN	You did.
M	ADRIANO	Then that was a slip of the tongue
F	KAREN	Have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee? A war committee?
M	MICHAEL	If I can interject here, I'm aware we're pushed for time. I'd like to move us on agenda-wise. Our next item is international relief co-ordination.
F	KAREN	Have you heard of this committee?
M	ADRIANO	What's this Liza Weld paper? Page 20
M	SIMON	Should I say something? She invited me, I should say something. If you don't say something in the first 10 minutes, you can end up not saying anything at all.
F	JUDY	I don't know whether you should say anything.
M	SIMON	I'm saying something ... I think I'm going to try saying something.
F	KAREN	Look - I just think it's worth noting that Ministers in The UK Government, such as our colleague here ...
M	SIMON	Is she talking about me?
F	KAREN	Simon Foster ... SIMON She's talking about me!
F	KAREN	Has made it clear that for them currently war is unforeseeable. Isn't that right Simon?
M	SIMON	Well, yes, I mean, that's what I said. And I stick to what I said.
M	SIMON (CONT'D)	But that doesn't mean that what I said won't ever change. It's not imutable. Or mutable. It's an ongoing ...
M	MICHAEL	I wonder if there aren't some area of mutual agreement we can't rattle through here and see how much time we have at the end for this discussion?
F	JUDY	Thanks.
F	SUZY	Is that all fine? JUDY That's all fine. Thanks for that.
F	SUZY	Thanks.
M	SIMON	Come here - we need to talk What do you mean stop being a `tit'? In what way was I being a tit? Why am I even over here if I'm not meant to say anything?
F	JUDY	You were just meat in the room, Simon.
M	SIMON	'Meat in the room'? Oh for fuck's sake Judy. I took an hour out to come over here and be room meat?
M	TOBY	But you know you're a prime cut, you're not - offal.
M	SIMON	Great, I'm not liver. What was I, tit meat?
F	KAREN	Whichever committee they don't want me to be a member of, I want to be a member of that. It's a confused Groucho Marx.
F	LIZA	Okay. Right.
M	CHAD	Hey Liza. Your paper got a major citation. You must be psyched Karen brought it up.
F	LIZA	She...that was her call. I didn't know it had been that widely read.
M	CHAD	You could not write anything that clashes more violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you were trying, and it almost seems like you were trying.
F	LIZA	I wasn't trying, believe me.
M	CHAD	You are like the woman from The Omen, you've given birth to a demon and it's going to kill you.
F	LIZA	You probably identify with the kid from The Omen right?
M	CHAD	Ooh.
F	LIZA	See, you're an only child, aren't you?
M	CHAD	You bring this up whenever you run out of arguments. I don't see how my parents' limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me. I'm the sperm that made it.
M	CHAD (CONT'D)	Have fun with your career kryptonite.
M	SIMON	What's that all about? It looks important.
F	KAREN	My teeth hurt. I think the veneers are chipped. Do they look chipped?
F	LIZA	Well, I think that one, that one's always been there, right? I'm not sure. Have you got any painkillers?
F	KAREN	Oh, don't look at my teeth.
F	JUDY	Sshhh!
F	KAREN	I don't want to risk a dentist here.
M	TOBY	Hey Liza!
F	LIZA	Oh ... Hi ... hi? She knows him but can't immediately place him.
M	TOBY	Toby? It's Toby.
F	LIZA	Hi. Hi.
F	JUDY	What are you doing? You look like you're practicing baby massage.
M	TOBY	She did the Kennedy scholarship at my college. I had a small thing for her.
F	JUDY	I can imagine.
M	TOBY	I'm not sure she remembered me.
F	JUDY	No, that is one of the side effects of Rohypnol.
M	Page 25	
F	KAREN	Linton has set up a secret war committee, I just know it. I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic, Liza. He is dangerous. The voices in his head are now singing barbershop together.
M	SIMON	Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's not a war. It's going to be a nightmare. It's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics.
M	PRESS	Minister!/Simon!/Mr Foster!
M	SIMON	Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don't need this.
F	JUDY	Er, you wanted a chance to row back on the war. Do you want to nail the line?
M	SIMON	What? No. No. I'll freestyle it.
M	REPORTER 1	Is war unforeseeable Minister?
M	SIMON	...loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable. Y'know, For the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly very real and inevitable.
M	REPORTER	Sorry, are you saying that...?
M	SIMON	What I'm saying is that to - walk the road of peace, sometimes you need to be ready to climb the mountain of conflict. Thank you!
M	SIMON	Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck. Why didn't we nail the line?
F	JUDY	I did try to warn you.
M	SIMON	You did try to warn me but you didn't actually stop me, did you?. That's like shouting 'Train!' as I get hit by a train. You should go 'Look! Train! There's a Fucking Train!'
M	SIMON (CONT'D)	Oh shit. It's Malcolm.
F	JUDY	It's Malcolm for me too.
M	SIMON	How does he do that? Hello?
F	MALCOLM	Simon. I don't like finding out about people I work with via the news, unless they've died. Get over here now so we can address at least one of those issues. TOBY The thing is. On the war. With your profile.. ... Maybe we should - get it out there? That the war is a resigning issue for you.
M	SIMON	You can't say it's a resigning issue. Because you then have to resign. JUDY You are having a really great first day you know that?
F	MALCOLM	You are supposed to be a Cabinet Minster. You are supposed to be officer class. Don't do this. Don't make waves.
M	SIMON	We can do without the ritual humiliation, Malcolm. You know I'm against talking up the war.
F	MALCOLM	You're against talking up the war? Is that why you said, "Climb the mountain of conflict"? Do you know what you sounded like? You sounded like a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews.
M	SIMON	I'm just saying. I might be forced to the verge of making a stand.
F	MALCOLM	Right, you two, The White Stripes, outside.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	There's only two people in the White Stripes. Look, I admire you, I really do. Making a stand. So, I take it I can tell the PM you don't want to go to Washington?
M	SIMON	To where...?
F	MALCOLM	Washington. The boss wants you over there on a fact-finder. Problems we might face if it all goes boombastic in the Middle East. SIMON Oh. Right.
F	MALCOLM	But you were saying, you are on the verge of your stand...
M	SIMON	Well, look - I don't know what words I used in the heat of the moment, but maybe in a sense I was on the verge. But that's the important thing - I was on the verge. Not in any way decided.
F	MALCOLM	Christ on a bendy-bus, Simon, stop being such a faffing fuck-arse.
M	SIMON	I am standing my ground on the verge.
F	MALCOLM	Well, when you go to America, talk to Karen Clarke at the State Department,
M	SIMON	I'll give it a whirl.
F	MALCOLM	But keep away from Linton Barwick. He's pushing the war for Caulderwood's lot. I'll deal with him. Dangerous fucker. keeps a live hand-grenade as a paperweight. True story.
M	SIMON	Oh right. I won't talk to him.
F	MALCOLM	Talk to as few people as possible. That would be best for you.
F	KAREN	Okay - so, priorities are: take a shower, get me on Linton's War Committee, get me a dental appointment. Not necessarily in that order. What's Linton been up to while we've been away....have we declared war on California yet?
M	LINTON	Ah. Karen.
F	KAREN	Linton.
M	LINTON	How was London? Good hotel?
F	KAREN	Great hotel, thank you.
M	LINTON	Good meetings?
F	KAREN	Yes. We had some good discussions. The time at Number Ten could possibly have been better spent but then...
M	LINTON	Good. Welcome back. I'll read your words when they come through. Thank you so much
F	KAREN	Is Chad coming... ?
F	LIZA	He's doing his desperate chorus girl thing, hanging around trying to catch Linton's eye. That's why he's wearing his push-up bra today.
M	CHAD	Assistant Secretary of State -- hi.
M	LINTON	Brad. CHAD Chad
M	LINTON	Uh-huh. Exactly
M	CHAD	Can I...?
F	KAREN	So listen, Liza, I need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill.
F	LIZA	Dullest?
F	KAREN	Because Linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey war committee...they'll have buried the war committee under the most boring name they can think of. 'Diverse Strategy Committee'- not that, I'm on that. But it'll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self-harm.
M	KAREN(CONT'D)	Can you get me General Miller at the Pentagon? My teeth hurt like hell.
F	LIZA	Sick of hearing about the teeth... Hi. I'm calling from Karen Clark's office about a paper written by a staffer here. We need to know if 'Post War Planning: Parameters, Implication's and Possibilities' has reached Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet? Yeah...by Liza Weld. 'Pwip Pip'? It's already been given an acronym? No I don't want to fast-track it. Would it possible to slow-track it? Well can we create one?
M	LINTON	I do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office. In my opinion glass offices are for perverts.
M	BOB ADRIANO	I could request the glass be frosted? Frosting is for cakes, Bob. Now. What happened in London?
M	BOB ADRIANO	Generally positive. Two glitches. Karen flagged a report by one of her staffers - Liza. She's obviously trying to use it as some kind of roadblock. It's called Pwip Pip.
M	LINTON	Pip what?
M	BOB ADRIANO	Pwip Pip.
M	LINTON	What is that a report on - birdcalls? What does that stand for?
M	BOB ADRIANO	I don't recall. It's factish. Intel - case for and against intervention.
M	LINTON	We've got all the facts we need on this. In the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king. You said there was another thing?
M	BOB ADRIANO	In the meeting with the Foreign Office the Committee was accidentally briefly alluded to.
M	LINTON	Which committee?
M	BOB ADRIANO	The war committee.
M	LINTON	Karen must not find out about that. She is an excitable yapping she-dog. Okay get the minutes of the meeting, we need to correct the record.
M	BOB ADRIANO	We can do that?
M	LINTON	Yes we can. They're an aide memoir for us. So they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said, but a more full record of what was intended to be said. I think that's the more accurate version, right? I don't like this section. Cut that. I don't think this is really what France are saying. Let's change that. And these. And let's reverse this.
M	BOB ADRIANO	That's something Karen said. LINTON It's not right. Change it.
M	BOB ADRIANO	Yes sir.
M	LINTON	And I like this.
M	BOB ADRIANO	Thank you.
M	LINTON	Let's say everyone agreed with this. BOB ADRIANO Excellent.
M	SIMON	What's she so fucking happy about? Is she laughing at me?
M	SIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd)	Why's she got control of the blinds? I'm a government minister. I should have blinds.
M	TOBY	You want me to order some blinds? Or I could get some heavy curtains with swags and a pelmet.
M	SIMON	Yes. I do.
M	TOBY	Oh. Okay ...
M	SIMON	Can we go somewhere else? So listen. My team for the US. Team Simon. I'm thinking of taking you and leaving Judy?
M	TOBY	I could work with that, definitely. Plus she can be a bit... you know? "Everything's a bit shit isn't it?"
M	SIMON	"So you're the President? And I'm supposed to be impressed by that?
M	TOBY	Yeah. "My husband works in Tower Hamlets." SIMON "That's much harder than being President". Okay. It's settled. Fuck it. She's staying behind. Go and tell her. Karen, Liza and Linton are among those seated round the
F	KAREN	Which brings us on to Any Other Business.
M	LINTON	I believe I've flagged everything I needed to discuss. As I usually do. Or everything you're prepared to discuss.
M	LINTON	What is that, Karen
F	KAREN	I understand you've started up a new committee, what's it called?
M	LINTON	What makes you think that?
F	KAREN	It was mentioned in our London meeting.
M	LINTON	You must have misheard.
F	KAREN	I misheard the word committee?
M	LINTON	Maybe it was another word. Like Khomeini.
F	KAREN	You're sitting on a new Khomeini?
M	LINTON	Possibly. There are a lot of words, Karen. Kansas City. Kitty. BOB ARIANO Itty.
M	LINTON	Itty is not a word, Bob.
M	CHAD	Commissary?
M	LINTON	Thank you, James
M	CHAD	Chad.
F	KAREN	Ok. Why don't you just recap for me all the committees that you're currently sitting on?
M	LINTON	I'm Sorry, Karen, you appear to be bleeding from your mouth.
F	KAREN	Oh don't try to change the subject Linton.
F	LIZA	Oh no. Holy Mother of....
M	LINTON	I don't mean to be rude Karen but that is a tad... repulsive. I can't concentrate on what you're saying. You have blood coming out of your teeth and that's not right.
F	KAREN	Okay, Liza come with me.
M	CHAD	Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen now. I don't like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth. It makes me think of Country and Western music. Which I really can't abide.
M	CHAD	Yes! Ha ha! Exactly.
M	LINTON	Actually while we're on Any Other Business I do have a few points I'd like to resolve.
F	KAREN	Where are at you at with the committees?
F	LIZA	I got it down to two. The Aims and Policy Alignment Committee. Here - put some down your front - you don't want it to go down your... And the Future Planning Committee.
F	KAREN	Well, it's not the first one. I set that one up. Does that really sound dull to you? I thought that was a good name.
F	LIZA	Right, no, it is a good name.
F	KAREN	Okay, find out if it is definitely the Future Planning Committee.
F	LIZA	Okay. Okay. Right, listen, I might go and do that. You're not going to shout at me if I go and do that are you?
F	KAREN	I'm not a fucking monster Liza, okay? Will you stop implying I'm some kind of monster?
F	LIZA	Bob!
M	BOB ADRIANO	Liza.
F	LIZA	So listen, Bob, there's something I really want to tell you. We're having a hunk of the month competition, and I just didn't want you to be feel...objectified in any way....and
M	BOB ADRIANO	Oh really?
F	LIZA	Karen knows about the Future Planning Committee.
M	BOB ADRIANO	I have no idea what you're talking about. Liza smiles. Runs back into the toilets and gives a
M	TOBY	This is cool.
M	SIMON	Don't be callow Toby. We're on official business.
M	SIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd)	This is a little bit fucking cool.
M	SIMON	There will be a car won't there?
M	TOBY	Oh God yeah, of course.
M	SIMON	Did you book a car?
M	TOBY	Me? No. I mean, Judy will have got someone to do it.
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	Hi Judy? Yeah sorry if you're in bed, but we're here and... Just can't see the car? Wondered what the car situation was?
F	JUDY	What car situation? The airport car?
F	JUDY	That's not my job Toby. That's Robbie's job to book it, your job to check it and confirm it. Alright? Good night. The call is over.
M	TOBY	Yeah. She's really embarrassed. Sounds like a snarl up her end. I'll see what we can do?
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	Here we go.
M	SIMON	`Simon Forester?' Hi we're the Simon Foster party?
M	SIMON	I almost feel like there should be hookers. Do you know what I mean? Really, here, we should have hookers.
M	TOBY	Hey Gav, I'm in a fucking motorcade!
M	DRIVER	You want girls?
M	SIMON	What? Oh no. God no. No no no no no. I was just - I was just joking. I don't want hookers. I hate hookers. I mean not in an aggressive way. I'm just not interested. But thanks. Thanks very much.
M	TOBY	It's like a hangar for businessmen.
M	SIMON	Toby, have you....?
M	TOBY	I haven't been to an ATM yet...I've only got English.... It's supposed to be a dollar a bag.
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	Technically, you've got a Capitol Hill view.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Hey Karen. You look beautiful.
F	KAREN	I bet you say that to all the girls.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Yeah I do. And some of the guys.
F	KAREN	That's why you shouldn't run for Senate. Too many skeletons in your enormous closet.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Yeah, don't believe the hype. I'm just thinking about doing ... something. I'm more than just a soldier, Karen.
F	KAREN	That's right, you're passionate about education and housing and what's the other thing?
M	GENERAL MILLER	Lingerie. That's right.
M	GENERAL MILLER	And bestiality.
F	KAREN	I'd forgotten about that. Are you still allergic to that dog?
M	GENERAL MILLER	Yes, yes. I wake up and my eyes are closed and my head is swollen and I look like a giant ball sack.
F	KAREN	Oh my god, they do have memdication for that.....but a beautiful ball sack, though. And how's the pentagon? GENERAL MILLER It's kicked up a level. Talking invasion real soon.
F	KAREN	Is there somewhere we can talk?
M	GENERAL MILLER	I don't know, I don't live in this house. KAREN What if someone comes in now?
M	GENERAL MILLER	I can't think of an excuse that would work can you?
F	KAREN	No. Just be careful. Don't mess stuff up.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Okay so that's total minimum European Theatre requirement.
M	GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D)	This is Far East, Korea, Japan etc. Page 43
M	GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D)	Add those. Plus contingency already deployed.
F	KAREN	Er - you've lost me.
M	KAREN (CONT'D)	Your military hardware is impressive.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Not anymore it isn't. Okay so this is total current deployment. Europe, Asia. And the contingency already deployed. So the current number of combat troops available for an invasion according to these figures would be ...
M	COMPUTER VOICE	Twelve.
F	KAREN	Thousand? GENERAL MILLER No, twelve. Twelve soldiers. Twelve.
F	KAREN	You're shitting me.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Of course I'm shitting you, but 12 thousand isn't enough. Twelve thousand's about how many are going to die. And you really need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it looks like you've lost.
F	KAREN	Uh-huh. Tomorrow I've got to meet these Brits. Simon Foster. He's the guy that said war was unforseeable, and I think he could very useful on the committee because he could internationalise the dissent.
M	GENERAL MILLER	You're going to use him as a little meat puppet. Simon knocks on the door. Toby opens, he's in his boxer
M	SIMON	Tobes. Hi. So! What's the plan? What swanky reception are we going to?
M	TOBY	What's the plan? For tonight?
M	SIMON	Well that's what I'm asking you Toby, my chief aide, my political advisor.
M	TOBY	I don't know, I thought tonight we'd be tired?
M	SIMON	Well I am tired but I'm also a career politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours. So I thought it might be nice to, you know, go out rather than sit in my room trying to spank one out watching a shark documentary, because I'm scared if I watch a porno it'll end up in the Register of Members Interests. So what have you got?
M	TOBY	Okay ... What have I got?
M	SIMON	Don't bullshit me Toby.
M	TOBY	Okay - so far, we have ... one flyer under the door for happy hour in the bar - which might be interesting? And I have the number of a guy I was with at Uni who I believe now works for CNN out here.
M	SIMON	No. No?
F	KAREN	Liza, where are you?
F	LIZA	Waving at you.
F	KAREN	Make yourself more visible.
F	LIZA	I'm practically on top of you. They meet.
F	KAREN	You can stop talking on your phone now. Look, I have to leave. Phone Simon Foster's guy. Tell them to come to the war committee. I'll give them some face time around ten o'clock. It'll be coffee and Danish...tea..they're going to want tea. Tea and sympathy. Tea and a handjob, whatever.
F	LIZA	Ok.
F	LIZA	Hey Toby! It's Liza Weld. Do you remember? What you guys doing tonight?
M	TV NARRATOR	There is still a great deal that is unknown about great white shark mating behaviour...
M	TOBY	Well it is unbelievably hectic. Page 46
M	SIMON	You can definitely spot the female ones can't you?!
M	TOBY	Attending the war committee. That's big. I mean, I have been on a committee before. "Challenges for the cheese market" - that was a big one... but...yes, sure I'd love a drink. Forty minutes? Great. where people sign off by repeatedly saying `bye' with Bye bye bye-bye-bye-bye-bye bye.
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	Hello? Hi? Hello?
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	Matty, hi, How's CNN? yes -- sorry? Do I sound muffled? to Linton's Future Planning Committee in the morning. The war committee, to you and me. So I'm prepping...what? Yes, Future Planning Committee is the war committee. You don't know that? I thought you worked for CNN? Or is that Cartoon Network News?
M	SIMON	Come in....I just wasn't expecting you to be here. Physically here. Obviously, you're always in my heart.
F	MALCOLM	I'm here, I'm there, I'm fucking everywhere. I am the egg-man.
M	SIMON	Have you come to insult me in a different time zone?
M	TOBY	No, off out now for a drink with her...yeah, yeah, ha-di-ha, but nothing's going to happen there. Little Toby's staying in his hammock tonight.
M	TOBY	Simon, I've managed to get us on the... MALCOLM Hello!!
M	TOBY	Fuck! Malcolm! Jesus.
F	MALCOLM	You're meant to shit yourself in there. Not out here.
M	TOBY	Right. I've got us on to Linton's Future Planning Committee in the morning.
M	SIMON	Okay. What's that?
M	TOBY	It's the war committee.
F	MALCOLM	What? The actual....war committee?
M	TOBY	Yeah, Liza says that...
F	MALCOLM	Who's going to be there?
M	TOBY	Karen Clark, Liza, me and Simon. Simon and me.
F	MALCOLM	Who else is going -- Jimmy Osmond? Gwyneth Paltrow? You've been invited to a diversion. The real committee, the real thing, that's happening at The White House.
M	TOBY	Yeah well, I'll text you the details because I'm going to go out.for A quick drink with some State Department bods.
F	MALCOLM	Don't mention this to the press, ok? Don't mention it to anyone. Because if the press get a whiff there's a war committee, even a cardboard one, every fucker in this town is going to turn up and try and get on it. So no matter what gay bar you end up, keep it schtumm.
M	SIMON	I was watching that.
F	MALCOLM	I have to have a word with you. You might want to slip into your negligee.
F	LIZA	You see those guys? The mosh pit?
M	TOBY	Yes, I don't think I've ever seen a more civilised 'mosh pit' it's more of a mosh caucus actually.
F	LIZA	House staffers, Senators' interns, most of them are half-man half-PDF file. Tonight they rage hard. Tomorrow they go back to the hill and argue noise reduction legislation.
M	TOBY	You're worried.
F	LIZA	It's Pwip Pip.
M	TOBY	I'm sorry? Pip Pip? Is this... a person or a cell phone tarrif or..
F	LIZA	It's my paper. On the war. Pros and Cons of the war. But I came up with too many cons. The pro-war guys have started calling me `Connie'. So, yes I'm fucking worried. My career's on the line.
M	TOBY	Yeah- I noticed you're worried, cos I saw you looking worried. I'm perceptive like that. But... Don't worry.
F	LIZA	Okay, this place blows. I'm going. What are you doing? Page 50
M	TOBY	Well I'm incredibly tired. It feels like my brain's eight hours behind but my liver's 12 hours ahead.
F	LIZA	You don't want to come back to my place for a quick catch up?
M	TOBY	However, due to technological developments I no longer need sleep, but am physically rejuvenated by alcohol!
M	TOBY	Could I just say, you know, that what happens in Washington stays in Washington?
F	LIZA	Yeah I live in Washington. So that doesn't really work for me.
F	MALCOLM	We are under enormous pressure Simon. Karen will want you to say, `war is unforeseeable'. Linton will want you to talk up `climbing the mountain of conflict'. You say nothing, okay? You can't swing both ways, you're not David fucking Bowie.
M	SIMON	Right. Can I go to bed now?
F	MALCOLM	No, we're going to run that through.
M	SIMON	Am I being tortured? Page 51
M	TOBY	Hello I need a number for a taxi in Washington DC. Straight through please. Hello. I need a cab, right now. From? From where? From from It's 40, 46, that's the number, and it's a street. It's a nice street with houses and cars and a - sidewalk and it's got leaves and - hold on I'm walking, I'm walking to a sign ...
F	LIZA	Marcel's is good.
M	SIMON	Uh-huh.
F	KAREN	You should go to La Taverna, the Greek place. It's fantastic.
F	LIZA	They set fire to the cheese. It's a lot of fun.
M	SIMON	It sounds a lot of fun.
F	KAREN	There's the aerospace museum, the National Gallery.
M	SIMON	Do they set fire to the paintings?
M	TOBY	Hi I'm sorry I'm so late.
F	KAREN	And this is your guy?
M	SIMON	Yes. He's, you know, among my guys.
F	KAREN	I'm Karen. And I believe you already know Liza.
M	TOBY	Yes. From college, in England.
F	KAREN	Pulled an all-nighter? Toby looks to Liza for guidance. She's not giving any.
M	TOBY	Yes, I, uh, got led astray.
F	KAREN	Oh who by?
M	TOBY	Uh, well I ran into - people. There's some people from - the MoD over and ...
F	KAREN	Not Penny Grayling?
M	TOBY	Er - no, another - gang?
F	KAREN	Right. Wow. I didn't know you had so many delegations in town. Page 53
M	TOBY	The British are coming!
F	KAREN	Well, I need to just check out a couple of things ... this seems like a good point to break things up.
M	SIMON	Er - no problem.
F	LIZA	It's been great.
M	SIMON	Terrific.
F	KAREN	I really appreciate this.
M	TOBY	Brilliant.
M	TOBY	Was that...?
M	SIMON	Toby -- I don't want to read you the riot act here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act. Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey. `The British are coming'?
M	TOBY	So I turned up late to the meeting Simon. I'm sorry. But it's not like I threw up in there. Page 54
M	SIMON	No you're right. I should be thanking you for not throwing up. Well done. You're a star. You didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'. No I'm being unfair, you got so much right. Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career. You're a legend.
M	TOBY	That was just - the first bit was it? We're going back in do you ...think?
M	SIMON	We'd barely said hello. I've had muggings that have lasted longer than that. We really only spoke about flammable cheese.
F	LIZA	Are these all requests to get on the committee? What's going on? Did someone post an invite on Facebook? I'm drowning in Senators. It's Senator soup here.
M	TOBY	Hi Liza.
F	LIZA	Hey Toby.
M	TOBY	You feeling okay?
F	LIZA	Yes, I'm feeling fine. Why were you late?
M	TOBY	Because...you know...you didn't wake me up.
F	LIZA	You looked so sweet. I thought you knew what you were doing.
M	TOBY	I was asleep, of course I didn't. That's how people walk out of windows.
M	STAFFER	Hey Liza, I've got another call about the Committee from Senator Crudden's office, he wants in too.
F	LIZA	What is going on here? Fuck. Why's this my problem? Toby you sure you didn't do bad? You didn't mention the committee to anyone else? TOBY Nada. Nada.. Bad-da. Nada-bada bing-bong ding-dang-dong. I have no idea what I'm saying anymore I think I really am still quite drunk.
M	CHAD	Everyone is so hot for your paper. I'm running off another ten copies. It's spreading like a virus, Liza. You're in hot water. You're lobsterising.
F	LIZA	I don't feel that.
M	CHAD	It's by degrees. Wafting. Bisque. I smell lobster. Can you smell lobster, Toby?
M	SIMON (O.S.)	Mate!
M	TOBY	
F	LIZA	Sure.
M	Toby goes back to Simon	Page 56 So, how far would you go with Linton, you freaky little stalker? Downtown? Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain?
M	A.J.	How are you today? Beat the traffic?
F	MALCOLM	Yeah yeah. Hunky dory. Can I get a coffee? He gives AJ his coat.
M	A.J.	eventually does and just Sure, sure, if we get started, I'll get my assistant to bring us some refreshments.
F	MALCOLM	Your assistant? A.J. Yeah. So, Item. We need to have a conversation about the mood of the British Parliament. Any bumps in the road ahead.
F	MALCOLM	I'm sorry son, am I - is this it? No offence, but shouldn't you be at school with your head down a toilet?
M	A.J.	Your first point there, the offence. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take it. Your second point. I'm 22. But - item - It's my birthday in nine days, so if it would be more comfortable we could... wait...?
F	MALCOLM	Don't get sarcastic with me son. We burnt this tight-arsed city to the ground in 1814 and I'm all for doing it again. Starting with you, you frat fuck. You get sarcastic with me again and I will stuff so much cotton wool dowm your fucking throat it'll come out of your arse like the wee tail on a playboy bunny. Okay? I thought...I was led to believe I was attending the war committee. Yes, Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick wanted me to brief you on the work of the Future Planning Committee.
F	MALCOLM	I don't want the bullshit son, I want the bull. No one sidelines me. I'm away.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	And here we go - the fucking Vice President has also graced us with his presence!
F	MALCOLM	Where is the fucking war committee meeting?
F	JUDY	Simon's going to the war committee I thought you knew?
F	MALCOLM	I thought I was going to the war committee? Tell me where the fuck it's happening!
F	JUDY	It's on the 7th floor in room 712. Oh Malcolm, do you like how I'm telling you what's going on where you are?
F	MALCOLM	Well let me tell you what's going on where you are sweet heart, a certain vinegar faced maniplulative cowbag is about to find that she's out of a fucking job...
M	SIMON	Here she comes - shit - look like we're meeting, look like we're having a meeting!
M	TOBY	... and if you look ... at the line they take in Newsweek - that's very much ... another narrative.
F	KAREN	See you at the committee.
M	SIMON	Yeah, yeah sure, see you in a mo. Just finishing off some stuff. Okay, we're all done there. Let's roll.
M	TOBY	I don't think you can say that anymore here. They don't like that.
M	SIMON	Shut up. Follow them. Don't lose them. Lets rock.
F	KAREN	Hello?
M	SIMON	Hello.
F	KAREN	Are you joining me or shall I see you there? See you there. I don't need to ... do any of the things you need to go in there to do, so I'll just see you there.
M	LINTON	We seem to be overrun with insurgents here, Bob.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Hi, I'm in seat 204, row W. Will I be able to see the big screen from there? Oh, and can I get one of those big pointy foam hands with `Go, Monster Trucks!' written on it?
M	LINTON	The general is on rare form, very rare form.
M	TOBY	There he is. General George Miller.
M	SIMON	Right, yep. There he is.
M	TOBY	That's the second time in 24 hours I've had a partially obscured view of him.
M	LINTON	Okay, due to the fact that seemingly everyone in the world who owns a suit has turned up for this meeting, we'll be relocating to a bigger room. Room 720. So, if you will be so kind... The committee members file out. GENERAL MILLER Just so you know -- Karen and I did not appreciate having to sneak around like Mulder and Scully trying to find out about this committee.
M	LINTON	Well, you're both here now. John and Yoko.
M	GENERAL MILLER	You and I need to talk, mano-a-mano, cocks on the block, about how things are operating around here at the moment.
M	LINTON	Sure. How about 12:30 tomorrow, my office?
M	GENERAL MILLER	Good.
M	LINTON	What the hell happened?
M	ADRIANO	I have no idea how they all heard sir. There must have been a leak.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Look at Adriano. Poor fuck. He looks like he's with his Daddy: "Sorry, Bob, you're adopted. From a couple with hereditary heart defects."
F	KAREN	"And your mother only ever kept your baby clothes for the purposes of voodoo."
M	SIMON	I'm room meat again. This is a massive abattoir of room meat. Stay outside Tobes, I need a guy on the outside. Make friends with Chad, that boy from The Shining. He knows stuff. Pump him. TOBY Oh no. I want to stay in here with Miller. Don't make me pump Chad.
M	SIMON	I'm making you pump Chad. Go on. It'll be easy peasy lemon squeezy.
M	TOBY	No it won't. It'll be difficult difficult lemon difficult.
M	LINTON	So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged session of the Future Planning Committee. You can all see an agenda?
F	KAREN	Assistant Secretary -- here on point 6, it feels like there's an assumption that we'll be invading. Should we talk about the practical? I mean this is the war committee after all?
M	LINTON	It's the Future Planning Committee.
F	KAREN	Unofficially it's known as the war committee.
M	LINTON	Well, unofficially we can call anything whatever we like. Unofficially, this is a shoe. But it's not a shoe, Karen, it's a glass of water, and this is the Future Planning Committee.
F	MALCOLM	Bitch! But what I'm asking is has a decision been reached in principle to advocate invasion?
M	LINTON	That's way off agenda Karen. Although it would seem a general consensus may be forming.
F	KAREN	What makes you say that?
M	LINTON	Well I noted with interest the recent comments of our colleague Simon Foster in that regard. `You are going to rebut that, aren't you?'
F	KAREN	Perhaps Mr. Foster would have something to say about that?
M	SIMON	I'm just...watching with interest. IN Britain we have a saying for complicated situations such as this, which is that it's `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult.'
M	LINTON	As I say it seems a consensus is forming.
F	KAREN	That's just ridiculous. You have no basis for saying that.
M	LINTON	Karen, please, calm down. We don't want you to have another hemorrhage. Item One. It's lunchtime. Lots of staffers have left their desks. A
M	TOBY	So - do you want to go out and get some lunch?
M	CHAD	Are you kidding? Lunchtime is work time.
M	TOBY	Yes, what an incredibly depressing motto. You see you're playing into the hands of the French saying that. Toby mooches around, peers in Linton's office. He spots a
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	Jesus.
M	CHAD	Yeah work hours are too valuable - for networking. You gotta get in at like 6 work till 8.30 Then start making those connections baby. Emails and admin at lunch. See if you can play some strategic racquetball through the pm. Then in the six till midnight slot chow down on some serious policy work.
M	TOBY	Right. And what - friends, family, novels, sexual inter-course you're going to save those for your thirties and forties?
F	MALCOLM	Are you fucking me about? Page 65
M	LINTON	Mr Tucker, isn't it? Hello again.
F	MALCOLM	You might pull this kind of stunt on some young wank fresh up from Oklahoma, happy to be getting his hookers paid for by tobacco lobbyists, but not me.
M	LINTON	What seems to be the problem?
F	MALCOLM	I've just had a briefing from a 9-year- old finalist in Americas got talent. I think he may have been a ventriloquist. Or possibly the fucking dummie.
M	LINTON	AJ? He is one of my top guys. Stanton College Prep, Harvard...he's smart and he's great at his job.
F	MALCOLM	His fucking briefing notes were written in Alphabetti Spaghetti. When I left I nearly tripped over his umbilical cord.
M	LINTON	I'm sorry if it troubles you that our people achieve excellence at a young age. By the way, your prime minister informs me that he's tasked you with collating some fresh British intel for us.
F	MALCOLM	Yeah, apparently your fucking master race of gifted toddlers can't quit get the job done in between breast feeds and playing with their power rangers. So yeah, we're getting some actual grown-ups to bail you out.
M	LINTON	Minister, thank you so much for your support and your recent "Climb the mountain of conflict" comment - great. We're going to run with that, it has great repeatability. Page 66
M	SIMON	Thanks very much, but...it's all a bit complex really, in terms of my...
M	LINTON	It's early days, my friend. All roads lead to Munich.
F	MALCOLM	What the fuck does that mean? `All roads lead to Munich'?
M	SIMON	Well it just means...I guess, I don't know what it means.
F	MALCOLM	`All roads lead to Munich'?
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	Come on let's go, get back to the hotel, nick as many coat hangers as you can. We're off back to London.
M	SIMON	It's beautiful.
M	TOBY	If you pull it out, America deflates.
F	MALCOLM	Don't mock that! The closest you'll come to getting one of those is buying a Toblerone. Mark Hadley's dad's died.
M	SIMON	Oh no. Should we send Mark a card?
F	MALCOLM	Nah, I'll send him a ouija board so they can keep in touch. So what are we getting back to? Apart from a nice cup of tea and some knife crime?
M	TOBY	Constituency surgery in Northampton.
M	SIMON	Great, meeting my constituents. It's like being Simon Cowell, but without the ability to say, `Fuck off, you're mental.'
F	ROZ	Sorry, could you...? You just need to kick the bottom quite hard.
M	SIMON	Look at them. They all have that smell....like a charity shop, you know? Afternoon!
F	ROZ	Right, here you go, you're pretty booked up - there's a list on the desk. I'm just going to have a look at the guttering.
M	SIMON	I'm just back from America, so it was pretty tough to make it up here - but you know. That's me.
F	ROZ	Of course. Right. How was the President? Page 68
M	SIMON	Good actually.
M	TOBY	And what was the White House like?
M	SIMON	Blown up by spaceships. scheduled. He's a man on a mission.
M	MILLER	Twelve-thirty.
M	BOB ADRIANO	Um, hold on General ... MILLER What the fuck?
M	BOB ADRIANO	Yeah, Secretary Linton Barwick wanted me to let you know his last - meeting looks like it's over-running. He sends apologies.
M	MILLER	He stood me up? They're better be a fucking good reason. Like he's dead. That is just plain fucking rude. I mean, how would he like it if I just did a big hairy shit on his desk?
M	BOB ADRIANO	You're very w-welcome to wait, we have newspapers and periodicals? Page 69
M	MILLER	Yeah well excuse me if at this time of national crisis I don't sit with a thumb up my ass flipping through Time magazine eating pop tarts? Tell him to call me. But he might not get through cos I'm a fucking busy man.
F	KAREN	Hey, what is it?
M	MILLER	Yeah - can I hang around in here for a while?
F	KAREN	Er. Sure. Why?
M	MILLER	Do I need a fucking reason? Linton's playing me like a fucking turkey drumstick on a big bass drum.
F	KAREN	Look, I was going to order food, do you want to eat.
M	MILLER	Yeah. Order us some cute mammals. Alive. A lamb or a piglet so I can snap it's fucking neck. Simon listens behind a desk. Roz is there taking notes. My point is - if the septic tank - if we didn't know it was there in the first place how can we be responsible for it now?
M	SIMON	Yes. No. I understand.
M	MRS MCDAIRMID	It's under the communal drive. Why should we get it pumped?
F	ROZ	Well it's not a council sceptic tank so they're not legally obliged to pump it...
M	MRS MCDAIRMID	Look, according to the paperwork there's four metric tons of of shit under there. That's not all me, is it? I'm not a flipping elephant am I?
M	SIMON	No, of course not. Nor should you be treated like one. Okay, Mrs McDairmid. Leave it with me. I'm sure there must be a way through this. Alright?
F	ROZ	Er, Colin Lowe. SIMON Jesus. Still on about bendy buses? No. Tell him no. What else?
F	ROZ	Pauline Michaelson's son about the constituency office wall.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	Hi, thanks for seeing me Mr. Foster.
M	SIMON	Hi Paul, call me Simon. You've met Roz.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	I know I have.
M	SIMON	Lovely.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	Okay, Simon, I'll try to keep it brief because I can see you're a busy man. There's a bloke out there wants to make it illegal to talk in a foreign language in shops.
M	SIMON	Yes, well, this place can become a magnet for the mentally dispossessed. And for sensible people like yourself, Paul.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	Patronising.
F	ROZ	Why don't you explain your issue, Mr Michaelson?
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	I...sorry, is this a joke? How many times? For the fourth f...ing time. The side wall. Of this property. Your wall. Is falling over. On to my mum's garden. She called you up - but she got fobbed off by your people. Because she's not Lord Snooty in his posh car. Because she's not Madonna on a horse.
M	SIMON	That...I agree, it's unacceptable.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	Do you know what this is? That's your constituency office hold music. I don't want it in my head, do I?
M	SIMON	We did arrange to get a quote from a builder, but...
F	ROZ	Patch from London. They say it's urgent. Karen Clark? Is she the coracle woman?
M	SIMON	Right. Paul, I really need to take this, but I haven't forgotten about you, okay?
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	No, well I'm not going anywhere, Simon. You won't be able to forget me because I'll be sitting here staring at you.
M	SIMON	Toby, can I hand Paul over to you?
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	"Can I fob Paul off with you?"
M	TOBY	So, Paul, where are we up to? I was out getting coffee. Sorry. GENERAL MILLER See, this is the problem with civilians wanting to go to war. When you've been there you don't want to go back unless you absolutely have to. It's like France.
F	KAREN	You finally read Liza's paper?
M	GENERAL MILLER	Course, I read it. I'm a voracious reader. I'm the fucking Gore Vidal of the Pentagon. You don't want that?
F	KAREN	Yes I want that. I want that, that, that, that and that. Those I don't care about. And these let's pack up and drop on North Korea.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Someone should leak this.
F	KAREN	Someone maybe shaped a little bit like you.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Me? Are you kidding?
F	KAREN	You have more gravitas.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Exactly. I'm too senior. I can't leak. Leaking is for people like your Liza and the Boy called It out there. It's insane. Not only is the case against war incredibly strong, the case for is caveated to hell. "Most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders..." Then here in the caveats, the only source is `Ice Man' - a possible alcoholic - who's probably called that cos he gets through ten bags / icebergs a day in his fucking vodka tonics. INR say we can't trust him. That's us disputing our own findings. Has Linton read this?
F	KAREN	I'm not sure he reads. You're a General. Have him killed.
M	GENERAL MILLER	You see this is why we never got together. That and the hobo teeth. Page 74 This is a private call right -- unrecorded, secure line etc etc?
M	SIMON	Well, yeah. I mean, your lot are probably getting it somehow, but our lot shouldn't be.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	I'm still here, Simon.
F	KAREN	What's going on Simon?
M	SIMON	Departmental business. About a wall. KAREN Gaza?
M	SIMON	Uh-huh. What can I do for you?
F	KAREN	Where were you in the committee? I called for back-up, you sat there like a dumb sack of shit. Maybe worse, cos at a molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy.
M	SIMON	Well - okay. Yes. Um. Well, I have to say Karen, I have a clear strategy here. I'm playing the long game.
F	KAREN	There is no long game. They've bounced us into a short game. You looked like a...what do you call it in England? A 'wanker
M	SIMON	We don't call it that, no...
M	TOBY	
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	Patronising.
M	TOBY	Sorry. But I'm on your side. I have to look after my Mum too. You do, or they get shafted don't they? So...
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	I'm going to pursue this with, what do they call it? Extreme prejudice, to the very end. I can be enormously persistent. Ask my ex-girlfriend.
F	ROZ	Okay, well, I'll take your details. Roz leads Paul away
M	SIMON	That guy's a bit full-beam.
M	TOBY	Full-beam?
M	SIMON	Yeah, full-beam. Headlights. I kept thinking, is he going to nut me. He appears not to be nutting me, but he might well nut me.
M	TOBY	So what did Karen Clark want?
M	SIMON	Do you think I came over as weak on the committee over there?
M	TOBY	Well, uh, no, of course not. I suppose -
F	KAREN	Also - the war committee got leaked, and that leak came from your department. Page 76
M	SIMON	I find that difficult to believe.
F	KAREN	I want action to be taken. I want a head. On a plate. To go.
M	SIMON	You don't work here. You're not my boss. Fuck off. You can't make me sack people.
M	SIMON	We need to talk in my office.
F	JUDY	About what?
M	SIMON	I think you know. JUDY Sorry, this is the wrong extension. I'll put you through now.
M	SIMON	Come, come into my office. Why? Why do you need to see me?
M	TOBY	What's this?
F	JUDY	It's the mad man about the wall.
M	TOBY	The war?
F	JUDY	The wall.
M	SIMON	Can you come into my office so I can tell you off?
M	TOBY	Hello. Can I help you? Malcolm sweeps in, straight past Toby, slapping him on
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	You fucker. No, not you.
M	TOBY	What can I do for you Paul?
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	These `temporary buttresses' you got put up.
M	TOBY	Right?
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	They're basically a pair of twigs. Thin twigs.
M	TOBY	I'm sure they're not twigs.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	No they're twigs. Are you getting a picture of those twigs? That wall could fall on my mum and crush her. Do you know how old she is? Mum, how old are you? I want to tell the newspaper guy. Sixty.
F	MALCOLM	I want a word with the minister and Charlotte Fucking Bronte.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	You're never fucking sixty. You're older than that. Sixty. How old are you really?
M	MUM (O.S.)	I'm sixty. If it's going in a newspaper, I'm sixty.
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	Fuck off are you sixty. Olivia Newton- John's fucking sixty. And she's not on the statins, is she? TOBY Could you tell your mum to stay away from the wall just for the time being?
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	She needs to get to her plants. She has to water them. Plants need water.
M	TOBY	No, sure, but could she use a hose, from a distance?
M	PAUL MICHAELSON	She doesn't have a hose, she's got a watering can. This is like talking to a brick wall about a brick wall. Get that down, that's gold. Page 79
F	KAREN	Liza, what's up? Why is everyone running around? This better be a fucking fire drill.
F	LIZA	The President has said he's vetoing tarrifs on Chinese auto imports.
F	KAREN	Shit. Karen calls over to a staffer, ABBEY.
M	KAREN (CONT'D)	Abbey, get me the president's statement.
M	ABBEY	Mr Barwick has asked me to...
F	KAREN	You work to me, Abbey, you fucking work to me. Get me the statement. Or I will call security and have you escorted off the premises via the window. Karen crosses quickly to her office. Liza follows.
F	LIZA	Sorry, why is that...? He's...what, buttering the Chinese up?
F	KAREN	He needs them to at least abstain in the security council.
F	LIZA	We're going to the UN.
F	KAREN	Yes, we're going to the UN.
F	LIZA	Shit.
F	KAREN	I should be told this fucking stuff! I'm going into Linton's office and pulling the pin on his grenade.
F	LIZA	Don't do that.
F	KAREN	I'm fucking joking.
F	LIZA	Oh.
F	KAREN	Why didn't you know about this?
F	LIZA	Well since I created the budget deficit the President doesn't tend to run things by me anymore.
F	KAREN	Don't get funny with me. I am not in the mood.
F	LIZA	No. I'm getting that.
F	MALCOLM	"While Foster jets around at the taxpayer's expense, his constituency headquarter's wall's collapsing and he doesn't give a shit.
M	SIMON	It doesn't say that.
F	MALCOLM	No but it says `Wall-ace and Gromitt'
M	SIMON	Wall-ace though? You are being portrayed as the biggest twat in Northamptonshire, and that's going some.
M	TOBY	It is just a wall, Malcolm.
F	MALCOLM	Listen, my little stem cell, I don't want to be dealing with this either, okay? I've got bigger fucking fish to fry, believe me. I'm rolling blue whales in breadcrumbs at the moment. I'm giving this to Jamie.
M	SIMON	Oh great. The crossest man in Scotland. Well, if it isn't Humpty-Numpty...
M	SIMON	What is this, surround bollocking?
M	JAMIE	With respect, I haven't finished. If it isn't Humpty-Numpty, sitting on top of a collapsing wall like some clueless egg- cunt.
M	SIMON	Hi Jamie. Hello.
M	JAMIE	Okay, that's enough of the fucking Oxbridge pleasantries.
M	TOBY	How is saying "hello" a...
M	JAMIE	Shut it, Love, Actually, or I'll hole- punch your face.
F	MALCOLM	Right, I'm off to deal with the fate of the planet, okay? Don't look at me like that's arrogant. That is just a fucking fact. Don't even look at me. Be gentle with them.
M	JAMIE	You know me, Malcy, kid gloves. Made from real kids.
M	JAMIE (CONT'D)	Right, Butch and Gaydance, this wall story is playing badly. Look, here's a cartoon of you as a walrus.
M	SIMON	A walrus? I'm not fat. I don't even have a moustache.
M	TOBY	Look...we hired some builders. They didn't turn up when they said they would.
M	JAMIE	They're builders. What did you expect?! Have you ever seen a film where the hero is a builder? No. Because they never turn up in the fucking nick of time.That's why you never see a superhero with a hod.
M	SIMON	This is all getting...this is a really stressful job, you know that?
F	JUDY	Oh come on, you're not a brain surgeon, you're not a snooker player ...
M	SIMON	I don't want to back a war, Judy. Oh. Right.
M	SIMON	Look, drop some hints, put some nods and winks out there, that I'm toying with resignation. Yeah? See if the PM reacts. See how it plays.
F	JUDY	Put out some winks?
M	SIMON	And nods.
F	JUDY	Big nods? SIMON No, no, just sort of... That sort of size nod.
M	SIMON (CONT'D)	No, not that much.
F	JUDY	No, I was just nodding normally to say I understood the need for a small nod. SIMON Oh. Good.
F	MALCOLM	So, my lovely friends, bottom line...
M	MICHAEL	I hate that phrase. We're not in retailing
F	MALCOLM	Sorry Michael, I promise never to use it again. Bottom line, is that the President is going to the UN, and the PM would like us to join him. This will be the voe to commence military action. So, Rob, Innis, Little Bo Cock Jockey And the leaky fucking mingebox, return to your desks and prepare for some extreme briefing.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	Now then, you still got doubts, Complicated Simon?
M	SIMON	What the fuck, Malcolm. This is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war. We fight people, and kill them, and our kids get killed, and that's exactly the sort of thing I didn't want to do when I went into politics. That's the opposite of what I want to be doing.
F	MALCOLM	That's why you've got to stay in Government. In here you can influence things, delay things. Out there you're just another mad shouty fucker people don't want to make eye-contact with. Remember Mary? She took a stand over Health. Everyone decided she was mental.
M	SIMON	Only because the Sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow.
F	MALCOLM	I found that a very powerful image. Look, the Prime Minister of this country is not a Viking. He doesn't drink blood, he doesn't go round biting tramps. He doesn't go to Chequers at the weekend for a bit of light raping and a pub lunch.
M	SIMON	I know the Prime Minister isn't a Viking, Malcolm.
F	MALCOLM	Unlike me, the man abhors physical violence. Page 85 He's a grade A fucking pussy and he knows you have similar concerns and he wants your input on this. Yeah?
M	SIMON	Where's the intelligence? Where's the hard evidence?
F	MALCOLM	Listen, We've got evidence harder than a diamond dildo. We have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking puncture your kidneys.There's an informant, `Ice Man', OK? The stuff he's giving us? It'll make your blood run cold. And clot. Your insides will turn to black pudding. ...now, certain box-lickers are sitting on it. But you're going to see it, because the PM regards you as a key player now. Judy's mobile goes.
F	JUDY	Judy Molloy? (BEAT) Ten minutes. Thanks. Prime Minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes, Simon. He want you to go the UN.
F	MALCOLM	See- you're A-list now. You're a Kennedy. In the VIP lounge, with the gold card and the complimentary drinks and the hard-on.
M	SIMON	Show me the evidence, Malcolm, that's my fucking bottom line.
F	JUDY	So do you still want...nods and winks?
M	MICHAEL	Cheers everyone. Here's to surviving another day.
F	JUDY	My theory is Malcolm built Jamie in a lab out of bits of old psychopath.
M	TOBY	Hello ladies.
F	SUZY	And gentleman.
M	TOBY	Hello ladies. I'm just going to -
M	MICHAEL	Oh. Lovely. I think we could have another bottle of Sancerre.
M	TOBY	Great.
F	SUZY	If you can afford it.
F	JUDY	If you can get served at the bar.
F	SUZY	Fucking hell. Here we go again. Fucking arsehole.
M	MICHAEL	You're kidding? What's it say? Woah!
F	JUDY	What a twat. What are you doing? Are you replying? Page 87
M	TOBY	Yeah I wouldn't want to meet Jamie in a dark alley. Or a bright alley. The whole thing of just being in an alley with him would be scary, regardless of the lighting.
F	SUZY	You've got a text.
M	TOBY	Oh yeah. It's just Rob about football.
F	SUZY	So, Liza. You shagged her?
M	TOBY	What? No.
F	SUZY	Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been getting his flakey end away?
F	JUDY	I don't know anything about his flakey end.
M	TOBY	Could we not talk about accusations and, health issues, in the pub?
F	JUDY	I should go.
F	SUZY	You haven't finished your drink.
F	JUDY	No. I mainly have.
F	SUZY	Why did you do it?
M	TOBY	I don't know, it was a weird, intense time over there. It was...maybe, subconsciously, I don't know, it was a kind of last ditch attempt to stop this, awful...war.
M	MICHAEL	That's classic. That's definitely going in the memoirs.
F	SUZY	You had sex because of the war?
M	TOBY	In the broad sense. Sorry, can you stop doing that? Can we go somewhere where they're aren't enormous children eating snacks?
F	JUDY	I should go.
F	SUZY	Actually I'll go.
M	MICHAEL	Shall we stay?
F	JUDY	I should go. I've got a long walk ahead of me. But that'll keep me going.
M	TOBY	What the fuck is he doing here?
F	SUZY	What?! What the fuck are you doing here?
M	TOBY	Well I live here.
F	SUZY	No you don't actually. I'll go make that tea.
M	TOBY	Well, if I'm leaving, I'm taking my brie. Page 89 And the port. And my Nando's peri-peri sauce.
F	SUZY	Don't forget your hydrocortisone.
M	TOBY	You putting this in your memoirs as well?
M	MICHAEL	I should go.
F	SUZY	No, it's fine. Stay.
M	TOBY	Where's my needlecord jacket?
F	SUZY	Your geography teacher's jacket?
M	MICHAEL	That's not how you fold. TOBY Michael, this is one of the more humiliating moments of my life. I can pack a bag.
M	MICHAEL	The key to travelling is packing.
M	TOBY	I'm not going to fucking Fiji Michael, I'm being chucked out of my house.
M	MICHAEL	It'll save time the other end.
M	TOBY	There is no other end.
F	SUZY	Has she got big tits?
M	TOBY	Massive. Enormous. You can see them on Google Earth. They've got their own postcode.
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	See you then.
F	SUZY	Okay.
M	TOBY	Look, Suzy, this is probably going to sound odd under the circumstances.
F	SUZY	Quickie?
M	TOBY	No. Thank you. But no. It's about Liza.
F	SUZY	Oh good tell me more, tell me more about her tits.
M	TOBY	Listen, Suze, Liza wrote a paper, Pwip- Pip. I think, if it got leaked, it could stop the war.
M	MICHAEL	Good tactic. Get earnest. I tried that with the wife. Didn't work.
F	SUZY	You are such a fucking coward, you know that? And this is what? A make up leak?
M	TOBY	Does such a thing exist?
F	SUZY	Toby, take your rubbish clothes and your back issues of Mojo, your flute, and your eighth of dope and leave me the fuck alone.
M	SIMON	Should I resign? I've floated that I might, when I thought I wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if I did. I mean, do you think, is it braver to just resign and say, `No, no war'? JUDY Yes.
M	SIMON	Or is it actually braver to say, `I don't agree, but I'm going to grit my teeth and get on with it?' Is the really brave thing actually doing what you don't believe?
F	JUDY	No. Though -- maybe? What's brave about doing the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the wrong thing is braver. In a way. I mean, you know, wars sometimes work. The War of Independence, that worked. For the Americans. Second World War. That was a good idea. I mean not a good idea but ...
M	SIMON	I know what you mean. And the Crimean War -- we got nurses out of that.
M	TOBY	Nurses are good.
M	SIMON	Exactly. So...right. Exactly.
F	JUDY	So you're not resigning?
M	SIMON	where's Malcolm?
M	SIMON	In the motorcade. Let's get a car without Judy.
M	TOBY	You want hookers? You like hooky fucky?
M	SIMON	I want to talk about the resigning thing. TOBY Still?
M	SIMON	But with you and not her. She has this air of moral righteousness that inhibits you from... saying anything morally wrong.
F	MALCOLM	So. The wires are all currently reporting that you're going to resign from government over the war.
M	SIMON	What? That wasn't supposed to get outside.
F	MALCOLM	Yeah well it is outside. It's lurking outside like a big hairy rapist at a coach station.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	Do you know, if I could I'd punch you into total paralysis. Malcolm, Simon, Toby and Judy are being led through a
M	SIR JONATHAN	Hello, gentlemen, Sir Jonathan Tutt. This is it. The United Nations.
M	SIMON	It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it?
F	JUDY	It could do with a few more scatter cushions and a bit less asbestos.
M	SIR JONATHAN	I don't know what you were expecting -- Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of stonework tracery... great fountains...
F	MALCOLM	It's a shithole. It looks like a hospice for robots.
M	SIR JONATHAN	Linton Barwick is in there. Karen Clark is there. You're right here. If you need anything, just whistle. You know how to whistle don't you Malcolm? You just put your lips together and blow.
M	SIR JONATHAN (CONT'D)	Right. I'm off upstairs to the informal delegates' reception. Hope there's nibbles, I'm ravenous.
F	MALCOLM	Nibbles? Who still says nibbles?
M	TOBY	Fuck the nibbles, what was with the homoerotic tension? Page 94 Jamie. Hello?
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	No fucking signal down here. Jesus. I'd be better off in an internet cafe in Kircoddy.
M	JAMIE	Okay, your phone's off, which means you've been shot dead by a fat American, but there's been a fucktastrophe. Someone's leaked Liza Weld's Pwip Pip paper to the BBC. I reckon it'll be on the Six O'Clock news here, one o'clock your time, so it's going to fist your fucking vote apart. Missing you loads, pwip-pip, toodle-oo!
F	MALCOLM	Okay Jamie, two jobs. One: find the Pwip Pip leaker and kill them. That's one job. Job one has two parts. Job two: stop Pwip Pip coming out. Sow enough seeds of fear and doubt that the fat arses at the BBC dither till after the vote, okay? After the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take- off and everything is groovy. I love you. there, mingling.
F	MALCOLM	Do not move from this spot or I'll fucking stab you.
M	SIR JONATHAN	Hm?
F	MALCOLM	Was it you?
M	SIMON	No, what? No.
F	MALCOLM	But you know what I'm talking about?
M	SIMON	No, but whatever it was I didn't do it.
F	MALCOLM	Was it you, The-Baby-From-Eraserhead?
M	TOBY	No.
F	MALCOLM	So it must have been you Woman from The Crying Game?
F	JUDY	It wasn't me. You've really got it in for me haven't you?
F	MALCOLM	Someone's dropped a bollock in the noodles and I reckon it was you.
F	JUDY	We've done this all before. You accused me of leaking last time and it wasn't me.
F	MALCOLM	Yeah well I know you didn't leak last time. But what I reckon is you got so pissy about being accused, you leaked this time.
M	TOBY	Yeah. Yeah, that does sound possible.
F	JUDY	Look Springer Spaniel, keep your little wet nose out alright? Page 96
M	TOBY	I'm just saying psychologically speaking that sounds plausible - that you might build up a resentment and then pay it off in some underhand way. That's just something I've observed.
F	MALCOLM	Come on, Baldermort, I need a word.
M	TOBY	Sorry about that - it's just ... something I've observed.
F	JUDY	Wanker. It's okay. It's fine. It's probably just the stress of this awful, awful war.
F	MALCOLM	We're in a new reality now and You've got to speed things up.
M	SIR JONATHAN	What things? Speed up what? MALCOLM The debate. It needs to start at eleven o'clock, not one thirty.
M	SIR JONATHAN	Hehe. Can I perhaps briefly explain the way the process works? And why that isn't possible? You see through that door there are a number of secretariats that are currently doing what we call the washing up now...
F	MALCOLM	Just fucking do it, fishlips. Otherwise you'll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the Caucasus with your arse in the air, trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that sustained sexual violence is not the way forward.
M	SIR JONATHAN	No, it can't be. I mean it could be done, it just can't.
F	MALCOLM	Then I'll do it. They're through there?
M	SIR JONATHAN	Yes but you can't go in, that would be a serious breach of protocol ...
F	MALCOLM	Then you do it. Get in there. SIR JONATHAN I'm not dancing with you Malcolm.
F	MALCOLM	I'm leading, look follow my lead.
M	SIR JONATHAN	You're not dancing me into the secretariat! Where's the intel? Are you sure you're working as hard as me? Cos I'm sweating spinal fluid here. I'm a husk.
M	MILLER	You get everything you need?
F	MALCOLM	Oh yeah I think so. Thanks. Oh, Whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment General Flintstone. Was it you? Did you leak Pwip Pip? I know you can't fire a gun, but can you use a fax?
M	MILLER	No, see, because I'm upfront about what I do. I don't creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other people's dirty work. Page 98
F	MALCOLM	I'm doing my own work. I'm doing my job.
M	MILLER	Uh-hu. I think you're doing Linton's dirty work. I think you're his English bitch and if I walked into your hotel room tonight I'd find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of you.
F	MALCOLM	Oooo. Tough talk from the armchair General. What you going to do? Throw a cushion at me? Put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why don't you?
M	GENERAL MILLER	Listen, Tucker, you may be some scary poodlefucker back in London, but here? You know what you look like? A fucking squeezed dick. You got a blue vein running all the way up to your temple there. That's where I'd put the fucking bullet. But I'd stand well back. You look like you'd be a squirter.
F	MALCOLM	Have you ever even killed anybody? Really?
M	GENERAL MILLER	Yep.
F	MALCOLM	Falling asleep on someone doesn't count.
M	GENERAL MILLER	I've done my share. How many you kill, pussy drip?
F	MALCOLM	Personally, I prefer maiming.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Go on, tough guy, take a swing at me. I'll smack you so fucking hard you'll be shitting teeth.
F	MALCOLM	Go ahead. I can see the headlines now. 'Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In UN, Swiss Intervene'. I don't know, I'm no expert on spin but could that hurt your career?
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	Right. Do excuse me. I've got work to do. Oh, and don't EVER call me fucking English again.
M	SIR JONATHAN	Hello everyone. I was wondering if I might suggest a cheeky early vote? Bit of an adventure. Maybe, we could knock off early, go for a drink? Ha. I'm kidding. Or am I? No, I am.
F	KAREN	There it is. Simon's going. Everyone's saying he's going.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Simon! There he is! Simon. This is great shit. I wasn't sure you had the nerve. You're resigning?
M	SIMON	Ah okay. They're not running with that? I have not said that.
M	GENERAL MILLER	You're not resigning?
F	KAREN	You're still playing the hawk?
M	SIMON	It's much subtler than that. It's nuanced. I'm playing a much cleverer game than that. I'm a fake hawk. Page 100
M	GENERAL MILLER	I'm sorry?
M	SIMON	Fake hawk.
M	GENERAL MILLER	You're a fake hawk? You're a fucking idiot. You're not a fake idiot are you.
F	KAREN	We could just tell the press he's going anyway. Say he's confirmed to us that he's resigning.
M	SIMON	Sorry?
M	GENERAL MILLER	I second that.
M	SIMON	What? You can't.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Do we announce it before or after the vote? KAREN During. Then he can't do anything about it.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Great. That's decided then.
M	SIMON	No. No it's bloody not. I'm - me. You're not me. I decide about all the main things about me, okay? Not you. Me.
M	GENERAL MILLER	No. No Simon. I'm afraid not. Not on this one. This is too big for you.
F	KAREN	Be realistic. You're being used. We all are. The one thing we can do now to influence things is to resign. Sacrifice ourselves. That's our only weapon. Page 101
M	SIMON	Like a suicide bomber?
M	GENERAL MILLER	No, not like a suicide bomber. A suicide bomber gets to make a decision.
M	TOBY	Listen, I'm really sorry about Suzy and the texting and ...
F	LIZA	Good. Thanks. Do you have figures there for CFE minimum requirements?
M	TOBY	Er?
F	LIZA	Conventional Forces in Europe.
M	TOBY	Sure. I'll just dig that out. Look it was a very special evening for me and ... LIZA Sorry? What? You're mumbling.
M	TOBY	I just wandered if tonight when all this shit is over we couldn't - you know. You're single. I'm single now. You're a woman. I'm not.
F	LIZA	You want to have sex again?
M	TOBY	It's not a terrible idea is it? One more. For the Gipper?
F	LIZA	You know what a douchbag is Toby? You're a douchbag on fucking wheels.
M	TOBY	Thanks. That was short and sweet. Well, short and sour.
F	JUDY	You okay?
M	SIMON	I'm thinking of becoming a suicide bomber. JUDY That's certainly a very powerful way of getting your point across.
M	SIMON	Would you like a mint?
F	JUDY	I'm okay thanks. Are you thinking to overdose on mints? Because...
M	Simon eats a mint.	He's lost in his own world. Staring, maybe slightly
M	SIMON	Do you like me Judy?
F	JUDY	You're my boss.
M	SIMON	Yeah, but do you actually like me.
F	JUDY	Sure. Look, I'll leave you to your thoughts.
M	SIMON	I haven't got any thoughts. I'm just staring vacantly into space while a distant voice in the back of my head goes "oh shit" like a car alarm in the middle of the night.
M	JAMIE	Was it you? MICHAEL Sorry?
M	JAMIE	Not you. I know it wasn't you, you're too fucking horny for your Knighthood. Was it you?
F	SUZY	Was what me?
M	JAMIE	Was it fucking you!? Answer the question! MICHAEL She can't very well answer the question if you don't tell her what it is, can she?
M	JAMIE	Fuck off to your room, Count of Cunty Cristo, this is between me and her. You leaked Liza Weld's paper to the BBC. Tell me you leaked it.
F	SUZY	I didn't leak anything. I don't know what you're talking about.
M	JAMIE	You're lying. You touched your nose. That's what's called a `tell'. You are lying.
F	SUZY	No I'm not.
M	JAMIE	`No I'm not.' That's a tell as well. Classic. I know the leak came from here, from this fucking fax machine here.
M	JAMIE (CONT'D)	This is what I'm doing to the machine. start to break off, but he's still quite controlled You see? This is how angry I am with the piece of office equipment which leaked this document, so can you imagine how angry I am with the person who did it? Yeah? Can you Suzy?
M	MICHAEL	It was me.
M	JAMIE	Oh fuck off. Don't come over all Spartacus now.
M	MICHAEL	I leaked it. JAMIE What?
M	JAMIE (CONT'D)	Okay for a start turn that fucking row off. It's just fucking vowels. Listen to it. Just subsidised fucking foreign vowels. You only listen to that shit because it's bad form to actually wear a big hat that says "I went to private school". Who did you leak it to?
M	MICHAEL	I just sent it. I thought it was important so I sent it through.
M	JAMIE	Ok. See this fax machine?(kick) That's your career. I'm pretty sure it's fucked. Let me just check (kick). Yeah, it is. Plus, breach of Official Secrets, so that's fucking swannee. Maybe you can get a part time job in West End as a gentleman's fluffer. Or whatever the fuck they call it these days.
M	MICHAEL	Well, you know -- better to go out with a bang... JAMIE No, no. I will not allow this to be a bang. This will be a whimper, a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being fucked by a big metal puppy-fucking machine. And they do exist, `cos my gran's got one.
M	LINTON	So we're down to the wire here, Mr Miracle Worker, what have you got for me? What intel have you rustled us up?
F	MALCOLM	Honestly? I haven't got it. We need more time.
M	LINTON	You haven't got it? Can you delay the vote to give you time to get it?
F	MALCOLM	No. I've had the vote brought forward.
M	SIMON	Just getting my mints. Page 106 I am telling you to delay the vote and get me some new intel. Now.
F	MALCOLM	Okay, quick reality check, J Edgar Fucking Hoover. I don't work for you. You don't tell me what to fucking do.
M	LINTON	Well firstly, don't raise your voice. This is a sacred space. You may not believe that, I may not believe that, but by God it's a useful hypocrisy. And secondarily you do work for me. Your prime minister instructed you to work for me. MALCOLM Get your Polos and fuck off.
M	LINTON	The great Malcolm Tucker. One of your guys has leaked a paper, you can't do anything. We tell you to get intel, you can't do anything. I need the vote put back - you can't do anything. You, sir, are a useless piece of `S' star star `T'. MALCOLM What do you want?
M	TOBY	We've just heard -- the wall's starting to collapse. A brick has fallen. That's the news I'm getting. More to follow. Both news and bricks.
M	LINTON	Why don't you deal with that Tucker? A wall is falling down, that's more your level. I can see you with your shirt off and a wheelbarrow whistling a happy song.
M	SIMON	You've been working for him?
F	MALCOLM	It's complicated, okay? I've been juggling a number of responsibilities.
M	SIMON	Okay, well, right, after the vote, I resign.
F	MALCOLM	Look. It's too late now. Resigning. It's not worth it. The horse has bolted. It's out there getting shot now.
M	SIMON	I'll see you later, Malcolm.
F	MALCOLM	If you repeat this to anyone I will pull your leg off, break it in two and stab you to death with your broken shin bone. Now go away.
M	TOBY	Suzy, how's it going? Has Jamie been round? Right...
F	LIZA	This is you, isn't it?
M	TOBY	This is me, yes. And that's you. I thought we had this worked out. Sorry Suze I've got an incoming call, I'll ring back for a further bollocking.
F	LIZA	I've got something big lined up and you better not have fucked it up for me.
M	TOBY	Hello? Oh hi, Paul. How's it going? No, yes, I know the wall is collapsing. I'm as frustrated as you are mate.
M	TOBY (CONT'D)	Look, could I call you back Paul? It's just the Vice President's ... I couldn't? No, okay, let's keep talking... Michael and Suzy in Michael's office, classical music in
M	JAMIE	Right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra. I've got good news. You're not fired. That's great news, isn't it?
M	MICHAEL	That sounds ominous.
M	JAMIE	He's fucking delighted. We want to put Liza Weld's Pwip Pip out there, properly. In the public domain. We just have to refine it a bit.
F	SUZY	Refine it?
M	JAMIE	Take out the cons, change the name of the main informant.
M	MICHAEL	That's a complete fabrication. Changing his name doesn't make a difference. The main source in there he's not really called Ice Man, is he? "Mr and Mrs Man, you've got a son, Ice." So we change it, to another name. Who's the fuck with the fiddle? The Fiddlefuck.
M	MICHAEL	This is Debussy, if that's what you mean.
M	JAMIE	Okay, we'll call him Debussy.
M	MICHAEL	No.
M	JAMIE	And then you'll make a couple of other changes. It'll mean your fingerprints are on it, Mikey, but it's the only way to save your job, you leaky fuck.
M	MICHAEL	It wasn't me, Jamie, alright? It wasn't me. Don't make me do this. Someone else must have come in and used the fax machine.
M	JAMIE	What? Oh, that thing about your fax? Don't worry about that. I made that up. The paper was sent by e-mail. It;s just, the fax machine was there and it;s easier to kick.
M	JAMIE (CONT'D)	Come on Deuce Bigalow. You're coming with me.
F	MALCOLM	Yeah, BBC newsdesk please. Malcolm Tucker. (BEAT) Ben? Hi, how you doing? Yeah, well, I'm hearing you're preparing a story that we might not like.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	I just want to say please, this garden wall story, please don't run with it. Simon Foster's constituency-office wall? You've got that haven't you? I haven't let the cat out of the bag? Shit. Look, my reputation will be in tatters if you run with... And he's gone. Boo hoo. I've got a hard on.
M	TOBY	Can we stop running because my hands are really rather badly burned now.
F	MALCOLM	I know it was you who leaked Linton's War Committee. Oh? Right. It wasn't?
F	MALCOLM	Are you telling me it wasn't you? Is that your proposition? Is that want you want to say if I ask them to fly you to Diego Garcia and slip a hood over your head and carry out a cavity search?
M	TOBY	I don't actually recall. It was a busy time.
F	MALCOLM	That's more like it. So...you are now on probation. Okay? I am giving you a probationary period, which will last from today...until the end of recorded time.
M	TOBY	Okay.
F	MALCOLM	You're my guy now. I own you now. You're my Kunte Kinte. Go and get your laptop. Ah, ambassador -- with your big baldy head you are spoiling us.
M	SIR JONATHAN	Good, I've been looking for you. I needed to tell you that by a huge personal effort -- huge --I have managed to bring the vote forward by an hour and a half.
F	MALCOLM	Great. I need it delayed now.
M	SIR JONATHAN	Very funny. That is funny.
F	MALCOLM	By an hour, at least. Although I guess two and a half hours now, as you've brought it forward.
M	SIR JONATHAN	No, I'm sorry I'm very sorry but I won't humiliate myself again.
F	MALCOLM	You do what I say or you can go and see if Belize are looking for a new ambassador but with a broken nose, one bollock, and a half-chewed cock.
M	SIR JONATHAN	Right. What can I say? ......
M	JAMIE	This is nice isn't it? Cosy. Away from prying eyes.
M	MICHAEL	So what's this, your political wet-room?
F	MALCOLM	Is it up, have you got it up?
M	JAMIE	Yeah it's all fine.
F	MALCOLM	Okay, go to page nine, highlight that. JAMIE Go to page nine.
F	MALCOLM	Highlight from that page to the end of the document.
M	JAMIE	Do you mean select?
F	MALCOLM	I don't know I don't use these things.
M	JAMIE	Select page nine to the end of the document.
M	MICHAEL	The caveats?
F	MALCOLM	Is it highlighted?
M	JAMIE	You mean selected, yeah it's selected.
F	MALCOLM	Okay, right, standby ... delete!
M	JAMIE	Delete!
M	MICHAEL	You can't just delete the arguments against the war.
F	MALCOLM	Messenger! Get Messenger up!
M	JAMIE	Oh hang on Malc. Michael's stopped moving. I think he's crashed. Malcolm types something on the laptop while Toby holds it
F	MALCOLM	Have you tried hitting him? Give him a thump, that usually works.
M	JAMIE	Hang on, I think I might be able to use manual over-ride.
M	JAMIE (CONT'D)	No, it's okay. It's working again.
F	MALCOLM	Great. Now attach that to email.
M	JAMIE	Attach that to an email.
F	MALCOLM	Right, let's find a printer. The Japanese, they'll have one. They've got everything.
F	MALCOLM	Get me a blue folder.
M	TOBY	Where from?
F	MALCOLM	I don't fucking know. Do I look like I've ever set foot in a stationary cupboard? I do my shagging in five star hotels. Now go and find me a blue fucking folder. Pronto.
F	MALCOLM	The intelligence your guys couldn't find? I think you owe me a massive, grovelling apology.
M	LINTON	What, you did your job? Eventually? Congratulations. Maybe they'll give you a knighthood.
F	MALCOLM	It's been a pleasure working with you. You know, I've met some psychos in my time, but none as fucking BORING as you. Oh sorry, that's right. You disapprove of swearing. A boring F star star CUNT!
M	LINTON	Welcome aboard Liza. By the way, congratulations on Pwip Pip. Excellent work.
F	LIZA	Really?
M	LINTON	I don't know. I haven't read it personally. No time. But it certainly raised your profile. LIZA No. That old thing? That was like a thousand years ago. More maybe.
M	LINTON	Terrific. So, I'll keep this brief and to the point. We go in, we make our case using the new British intelligence from their source `Debussy', we win the argument, we get the hell out.
M	CHAIR	Resolution 5977 is passed.
M	SIMON	Yup. That's that then.
M	TOBY	"That's that then"? That's your quote for the ages is it? What?
M	TOBY	'And I remember the moment war was declared. I turned to the Minister and he said "That's that, then. Anyone want a mint?".
M	SIMON	Piss off, Toby.
M	LINTON	We did it Bob!
M	BOB ADRIANO	Yes sir! There were moments when it was a little hairy ...
M	LINTON	No there weren't, no.
M	JAMIE	Well done Michael. You did a good job. You did a really, really good job. Karen enters. Chad is there too with General Miller.
F	KAREN	So, I emailed my resignation ten minutes ago. Yours should come right after the President's announcement, to have the biggest media impact.
M	GENERAL MILLER	I've been thinking Karen. This has been the hardest fucking decision of my political life. I'm not resigning.
F	KAREN	What the fuck George. Seriously? You said that the war was intolerable and we'd go together.
M	GENERAL MILLER	It is - it is intolerable. I still agree with myself about that. But I've got to tolerate it. My loyalty is with the kids. At the end of the day I'm a soldier.
F	KAREN	You're not a soldier.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Look at the uniform, Karen. I'm not a pastry chef. I have military commendations on my chest, not a little fucking label saying My Name Is George.
F	KAREN	You're a politician. You live on canapes and white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and you scour the national papers for mentions of your name. You're a fucking politician.
M	GENERAL MILLER	I'm still a soldier. KAREN When was the last time you shot a guy?
M	GENERAL MILLER	What, if I haven't shot a guy in 15 years then I'm not a soldier? City hall don't insist I bring along a fucking bullet- ridden corpse every five years to renew my soldier licence.
F	KAREN	You know this is an unnecessary war. It's a war you don't believe in. Show me some balls, George.
M	GENERAL MILLER	I know I've got balls, I don't need to show them to you.
F	KAREN	Oh sure, It just so happens they're sitting pretty in a pair of Egyptian cotton Ralph Lauren shorts on a Government salary.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Don't talk about my fucking balls that way. My balls have been around. My balls have got balls.
F	KAREN	Come on Chad, let's leave the General and his over-stuffed scrotum. We're going to draft our resignation announcements.
M	CHAD	Er, I might, stay with the General actually Karen, if that's okay? If he's staying I might stay with him and see what assistance I can furnish.
F	KAREN	Okay. General Shrek and his faithful talking donkey.
M	GENERAL MILLER	This takes balls Karen.
M	CHAD	You've got balls Sir. Anyone can see you've got big balls. They're two-thirds of a snowman.
M	GENERAL MILLER	Get the fuck away from me.
M	CHAD	Okay. This was not the plan.
M	SIMON	No, you're right. I am a piss-brain. That's the perfect word, Mr Michaelson. Your mother came up with it? Well congratulate her from me. I am a piss- brain for letting this happen. Page 119
F	MALCOLM	Simon, look, mate. Listen to me. You still don't need to resign.
M	SIMON	No. I'm going to resign, Malcolm. In a hour. You can't stop me now.
M	TOBY	Boss?
M	SIMON MALCOLM	Yes? Yes? It's on the BBC News website -- Partial collapse of the wall. Mrs Michaelson's greenhouse has a smashed pane. The BBC had a crew down there.
M	SIMON	God, and that's NEWS. Ridiculous, isn't it?
F	MALCOLM	It's nor Ridiculous. You're fired.
M	SIMON	What?
F	MALCOLM	The wall. It's just not tolerable.
M	SIMON	It's just a fucking wall.
F	MALCOLM	Look at this. Give me the paper. He's my new boy. I'm just breaking him in.
M	TOBY	Here.
F	MALCOLM	The Telegraph has a cartoon of you crushed underneath the Great Wall Of China, suggesting you are the only political fuck-up visible from space. Look at this. No one could survive this. The PM is very clear on this - you're sacked, over the wall.
M	SIMON	No.
F	MALCOLM	Yes.
M	SIMON	You haven't even - spoken to the Prime Minister.
F	MALCOLM	Yes I have.
M	SIMON	You fucking haven't I've been right here.
F	MALCOLM	I have spoken to the Prime Minister. Whether it has happened or not is irrelevant. It is true. As soon as I heard about the wall, I spoke to him and he decided you had to go.
M	SIMON	I'm not going quietly. MALCOLM Yeah well if you try to turn this into some anti-war protest, you can expect your `mountain of conflict' soundbite to be everywhere from ringtones to a fucking dance mix on YouTube. I will marshall all the forces of media darkness to hound you to an assisted suicide.
M	MALCOLM (CONT'D)	Right, Rumpleforeskin's give me your laptop, so -- shall we draft your `Dear Prime Minister, just a quick note to say thanks for sacking me' letter?
M	TOBY	Hi. General? Look I realise this is a slightly strange time to say this, but I just want to say how much I admire...
M	GENERAL MILLER	Go fuck yoursefl, Frodo.
M	TOBY	Great. Lovely Linton is going through a list with Liza. General Miller
M	LINTON	Okay, I don't want to be accused of micro managing but I personally do not see that `I heart Huckabees' should be on the list of dvds suitable for forces entertainment. That self-indulgent crap is not suitable entertainment for combat troops. And where's `United 93' on here? That should be playing 24/7. Simon is back with Roz.
F	ROZ	Right, I've got a selection of quotes for you, they're all local firms and none of them is very well respected. Now, this sceptic tank is also rearing it's pooy head again too.
M	A.J.	Well Alan, I have been balled out by Linton for allowing I Heart Huckabees on to the troops DVD roster. You know the phrase, "I'm too old for this shit? Well, I'm too young for this shit. Page 122 I should be out there having a youth. Getting high, making women pregnant.
F	MALCOLM	Ah, here they are. Minister. Elizabeth. Welcome aboard.
M	MINISTER	Thanks Malcolm. Looking forward to it. War seems to be going `great guns' at the moment. Ah, cheeky! Let me take you out for an expensive lunch, roast swan and all the trimmings, and I'll bring you up to speed on the whole Middle East situation.
M	MINISTER	Are you twisting my arm already?
F	MALCOLM	Aye, but in a friendly, non-breaky way. Watch your step there. There's still blood on the deck. ADVISOR Hi I'm Danny. Dan. I'm Elizabeth's chief advisor.
F	JUDY	Judy Molloy. Senior Press -
M	ADVISOR	Have I got a desk?
F	JUDY	Yes, it's that one there.
