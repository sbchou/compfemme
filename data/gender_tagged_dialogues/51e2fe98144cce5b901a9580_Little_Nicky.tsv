M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	PEEPER	Showtime!
M	PEEPER	Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy? Well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats.
M	PEEPER	Oh my God, yes! I wish you would let me rub those feet. Of course I wouldn't use my hands. Heh heh heh heh...
M	PEEPER	Looks like Victoria just told me her secret.
M	PEEPER	Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m., first brassiere sighting... I will pleasure myself to this image for months. MONTHS I TELL YOU!
M	PEEPER	Young Scottie Dunleavy. What unfortunate timing. You mother was just getting comfy.
M	PEEPER	Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great knots today or whatever. Now get out.
M	PEEPER	Now what. This simply won't do.
M	SCOTTIE	Hello?
M	PEEPER	Hello, Scottie. Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up.
M	SCOTTIE	Who is this?
M	PEEPER	Just a little birdie. A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra.
M	MOTHER	Oh my God Scottie. Is there a man up our tree?
M	PEEPER	Tell her no. Tell her it's just a big bird.
M	PEEPER	Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me. And wear your bikini.
M	GATEKEEPER (O.S.)	Welcome!
M	PEEPER	Am I in hell?
M	GATEKEEPER	What do you think?
M	NICKY	Hey...
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
M	NICKY	Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
M	CASSIUS	I knew it. He's finally retiring.
M	ADRIAN	I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
M	HUMAN DARTBOARD	Aaaah!
M	CASSIUS	If the old man picks me to take over Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty four seven. No breaks.
M	ADRIAN	Well Dad says it's the breaks that make the torture. You have to let people feel a sense of relief.
M	HUMAN DARTBOARD	Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
M	ADRIAN	Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore.
M	CASSIUS	I'll take that.
M	HUMAN DARTBOARD	Was that really necessary?
M	CASSIUS	Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing today?
M	NICKY	Good, thanks.
M	CASSIUS	Hey. Hey. Hey. Wanna mind wrestle?
M	NICKY	Actually, I'll take a rain check on...
M	CASSIUS	Got ya!
M	NICKY	Yes, you got me...
M	CASSIUS	Got ya, again!
M	NICKY	Got me for sure, yes...
M	CASSIUS	Got ya! Now here's the big finish...
M	NICKY	Oh no. Please Cassius...
M	NICKY	Aaaaah.
M	DAD	What are you boys doing?
M	NICKY	Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
M	DAD	Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
M	CASSIUS	I forgot.
M	DAD	Maybe this will help you remember.
M	DAD	Now everybody sit down.
M	NICKY	Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
M	DAD	Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
M	DAD	My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was thrown out of Heaven by God and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. And after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne...
M	DAD	...to step aside. ...and let me become the ruler of hell. This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as Prince of Darkness. So I think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me.
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Knock, knock.
M	DAD	Yes, Jimmy.
M	DAD	No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
M	DAD	This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
M	NICKY	Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
M	DAD	Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
M	CASSIUS AND ADRIAN	What!?
M	NICKY	Hallelujah.
M	NICKY	I mean... tough break.
M	DAD	The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
M	CASSIUS	Dad! This is Hoyashit.
M	DAD	Right. Right. Send him in. I'm sorry, boys. I've got to get back to work.
M	ADRIAN	You sure about this decision, Dad?
M	DAD	I'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do.
M	HITLER	Holy schnit!!
M	CASSIUS	You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
M	ADRIAN	And he's dead serious.
M	CASSIUS	It's just such a slap in the face.
M	ADRIAN	Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
M	CASSIUS	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
M	ADRIAN	Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven." Well, I'm getting tired of serving in Hell. We need a place where we can rule.
M	CASSIUS	Oh you wanna be a big man? Bring it on!! Let's see what you got!
M	CASSIUS	That's what I thought!
M	ADRIAN	Could you concentrate for five seconds?
M	CASSIUS	I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
M	ADRIAN	What do you think about... Earth?
M	ADRIAN	We could create our own hell there.
M	CASSIUS	You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
M	ADRIAN	Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
M	CASSIUS	...their damned souls will be ours.
M	ADRIAN	It's our time, brother.
M	GATEKEEPER	Hey, what are you doing?!?
M	GATEKEEPER	You can't go through there. The fire flows in, not out.
M	GATEKEEPER	You know something? You guys suck! You really suck!
M	DAD	Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
M	NICKY	Definitely.
M	DAD	I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
M	NICKY	Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
M	DAD	Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
M	NICKY	Metallica, Dad. Come on.
M	DAD	I was just playing with you.
M	DAD	I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
M	DAN	C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
M	DAD	In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
M	DAN	You did it for Namath.
M	DAD	Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
M	DAN	This is bullshit, man. I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
M	DAD	Now you're talking.
M	NICKY	You're a good devil, Dad.
M	DAD	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
M	GATEKEEPER	Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell. They went through the fire, and they broke it. I think they took the New York tunnel. I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir.
M	DAD	Oh, boy. Oh boy. Calm down. Get off your knees.
M	GATEKEEPER	Thanks for being so understanding, your worship. You're the man. You've always been the man.
M	GATEKEEPER	I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
M	NICKY	Coulda been much worse.
M	GATEKEEPER	That's what I'm thinkin'...
M	DAD	This is bad, Nicky.
M	NICKY	How bad?
M	DAD	I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
M	LUCIFER	What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
M	DAD	Everything's fine, pop.
M	LUCIFER	Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
M	DAD	Please, pop, just go back to your room.
M	LUCIFER	Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
M	DAD	Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
M	GATEKEEPER	Oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it.
M	DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)	What's going on? Where are we?
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
M	NICKY	We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
M	DAD	To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
M	NICKY	So go get 'em, Dad!
M	DAD	I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
M	NICKY	So go get 'em, Jimmy!
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
M	NICKY	You're not saying it's up to me?
M	NICKY	I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
M	DAD	Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
M	NICKY	Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Not go. They left together at the exact same time. They gotta come back together at the exact same time.
M	DAD	Here. Get them drunk from this. One sip and they'll be trapped inside. Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate.
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Your ol' man's got less than a week.
M	NICKY	No. This can't be happening.
M	DAD	Son, just do your best.
M	NICKY	Okay. Earth. The Blue Marble. This doesn't look too bad.
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
M	NICKY	I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
M	DAD	That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
M	NICKY	Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
M	DAD	Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry.
M	NICKY	I'm Nicky.
M	BEEFY	Hey, terrific!! Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains.
M	BEEFY	My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
M	NICKY	I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
M	BEEFY	It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
M	NICKY	Okay, "bro," this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
M	BEEFY	It's not me, moron.
M	NICKY	Oh. Sorry.
M	PREACHER	Oh how the Lord loves you. All his children. He thanks you for your kindness. God bless, Ma'am. The Lord loves you... The Lord loves you...
M	PREACHER	The Lord does not love you. I sense... pure evil. You make the Lord very nervous. I'm burning... ahhh. The Devil walks among us!
M	PREACHER	Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!
M	BEEFY	Makin' friends already.
M	NICKY	It's freezing up here, Beefy.
M	BEEFY	You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
M	NICKY	I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
M	BEEFY	That pain is hunger.
M	NICKY	So far, so good. Now what?
M	BEEFY	Put it in your mouth.
M	BEEFY	Move your teeth up and down.
M	BEEFY	Now you gotta swallow it. Tilt your head back and let the meat slide down your throat-hole.
M	NICKY	Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
M	BEEFY	It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
M	NICKY	I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
M	GATEKEEPER	Hey.
M	NICKY	That's a pretty brassiere.
M	GATEKEEPER	Thanks.
M	NICKY	Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
M	GATEKEEPER	You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
M	NICKY	You got it.
M	NICKY	From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
M	BEEFY	Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
M	BEEFY	So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate.
M	TODD	I know exactly how you feel... The night Reagan was elected, I said to my mother, "Is this man going to blow up the world, Mommy?" Then we both cried for like an hour. Somebody's here. Call you later.
M	NICKY	Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
M	TODD	Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
M	NICKY	Yes. What is rent?
M	TODD	Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
M	NICKY	Off limits.
M	TODD	Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
M	NICKY	No.
M	TODD	It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
M	NICKY	Yeah. The deep South.
M	TODD	Why is that funny?
M	NICKY	I don't know.
M	TODD	And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
M	BEEFY	You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
M	NICKY	Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
M	TODD	Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.
M	CARDINAL	In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that. Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible. Moses this. Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.
M	CARDINAL	Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity. But has he ever really done anything for us? Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway? Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes? No. He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us.
M	MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN	The Lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs.
M	CARDINAL	Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs. He's a bore. At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.
M	YOUNG MAN	After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby.
M	CARDINAL	No, your best friend Fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby. He helped her conceive it all night long.
M	CARDINAL	How about you, Mr. Mayor? The Lord ever do anything for you?
M	MAYOR	Well, I wish I could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can't. Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord. If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called "sins." Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want.
M	CARDINAL	Amen to that. Let the sin begin!
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	Oh, this is delicious.
M	CASSIUS (O.S.)	"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
M	CASSIUS (O.S.)	I lowered the drinking age to ten.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end. Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
M	NICKY	This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
M	BEEFY	Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
M	NICKY	Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
M	BEEFY	Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
M	NICKY	Well, let's rock and roll.
M	NICKY	Get in the bottle. Dad's falling apart. You froze the gate and you're killing him. Drink!
M	CHINESE DELIVERY GUY	I'm not thirsty! I'm not thirsty!
M	NICKY	Just get in the flask!
M	NICKY	Adrian and Cassius! You think a kick to the head is gonna make me throw in the towel? Well, in the immortal words of Judas Priest, "You got another thing comin'."
M	GATEKEEPER	Bus?
M	NICKY	Beast.
M	GATEKEEPER	You like that? You think that's funny?
M	GATEKEEPER	How about that? You like that?
M	NICKY	All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
M	BEEFY	I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
M	BEEFY	Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just begging to come out...
M	PETER	Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
M	JOHN	'Bout time...
M	JOHN	There's our man.
M	PETER	Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
M	JOHN	What's with that guy?
M	PETER	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
M	JOHN	Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
M	PETER	Should we wake him up?
M	JOHN	Yeah. You do it.
M	PETER	Rise and shine, devil guy. Some dude just stole your shit.
M	NICKY	Oh nooooo...
M	NICKY	Which way did he go?
M	JOHN	That way.
M	NICKY	Iron Maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal.
M	PETER	Did you check out the dragon mouth?
M	JOHN	The Dark Prince is here.
M	NICKY	Hey...
M	STREET VENDOR	See something you like, my man?
M	NICKY	Yes. I would like my flask back.
M	STREET VENDOR	You callin' me a thief, my man?
M	NICKY	No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
M	STREET VENDOR	And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
M	NICKY	I don't know?
M	MAN	Yeah, how much for the silver flask there?
M	STREET VENDOR	Well, that's a very special item. The cap itself is one hundred percent plappium. It's a value is over three thousand dollars.
M	MAN	Really. Where's it from?
M	NICKY	It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once again.
M	MAN	Really. I think we'll let you keep it then.
M	STREET VENDOR	Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
M	NICKY	Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
M	STREET VENDOR	Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me? I'll show you some crazy eyes. Let's get busy.
F	VALERIE	Excuse me, does that flask belong to this man?
M	STREET VENDOR	Now you callin' me a thief? Damn.
F	VALERIE	Look, I know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time. But today, the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you. So why don't you admit today's not your day and give him his flask back?
M	STREET VENDOR	Or what're you gonna do about it? Ugly me to death?
F	VALERIE	No, but maybe that cop over there might have something to say.
M	STREET VENDOR	Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy. And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner. Before I show you what real crazy is.
F	VALERIE	Fine. I will.
M	NICKY	Hey, mister. I'll be seeing you in a few years.
M	NICKY	That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
F	VALERIE	That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
M	NICKY	You think I'm a tourist?
F	VALERIE	I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
M	NICKY	The South.
F	VALERIE	Really?
M	NICKY	Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.
F	VALERIE	Why are you laughing?
M	NICKY	I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
F	VALERIE	My dad's an optometrist.
M	NICKY	My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
F	VALERIE	I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
M	NICKY	If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
F	VALERIE	Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
M	NICKY	Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
F	VALERIE	That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
M	NICKY	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
F	VALERIE	If you want to.
M	NICKY	Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
F	VALERIE	"Octopus people?"
M	NICKY	Uh, it's a deep south expression.
M	NICKY	It's freezing my hands.
F	VALERIE	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
M	PREACHER	Why do you taunt me with your darkness?! Your evil is stinking up our streets! We're all gonna die!
F	VALERIE	This town is really going to hell lately. So what part of the city do you live in?
M	NICKY	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
F	VALERIE	You have a dog? What kind?
M	NICKY	I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
M	BEEFY	Remember, it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean.
M	GIRL DOG	Just finish.
F	VALERIE	I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
M	NICKY	School?
F	VALERIE	Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
M	NICKY	What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
F	VALERIE	My perfume?
F	VALERIE	It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Which I think is the French word for coconuts.
M	NICKY	Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
F	VALERIE	Sometimes, sure.
M	NICKY	Good. I was concerned.
M	GATEKEEPER	Doesn't sound very good behind there. I hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.
M	LUCIFER	You know, I was the one who created Hell.
M	GATEKEEPER	I know, your wickedness.
M	LUCIFER	I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
M	LUCIFER	Take it easy there, Chewbacca. In fact, you look like her mother, except she had more hair.
M	LUCIFER	You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
M	GATEKEEPER	It's Stanley, sir.
M	LUCIFER	Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
M	GATEKEEPER	What was it called, sir.
M	LUCIFER	Boogerland!
M	GATEKEEPER	That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
M	LUCIFER	I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
M	PEEPER	I deserve this!
M	KID	I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar.
M	KID #2	How many beers did you have?
M	KID # 3	Eight sips.
M	KID	I had five! I'm so wasted.
M	ADRIAN	When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific. But when a child goes... that's why I'm in this business.
M	NICKY	So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
F	VALERIE	Basically, yeah.
M	NICKY	Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
F	VALERIE	You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
M	NICKY	Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
F	VALERIE	What?
M	NICKY	Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
F	VALERIE	What was that?
M	NICKY	I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
M	NICKY	...I've always wanted to have sex with a gross pig. What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and see what happens?
F	VALERIE	You're a jerk. ADRIAN!
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	You shouldn't have come here.
M	NICKY (O.S.)	Please, get out of my mind!
M	NICKY	Hey, Valerie!
F	VALERIE	What the hell's your problem?
M	NICKY (O.S.)	Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	He's sick? Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright. Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
M	NICKY (O.S.)	Adrian, please...
M	PETER	Check this out. The number of the beast.
M	DAN RATHER	Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly's shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city. Today, some disgruntled cast members of the play CATS broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner.
M	DAN RATHER	...But even that does not come close to what happened today on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee.
M	VIDEO FOOTAGE	The set of Regis and Kathy Lee.
M	REGIS	So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
M	KATHY LEE	Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
M	REGIS	So I followed him...
M	KATHY LEE	You followed him?
M	REGIS	I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
M	KATHY LEE	You keep a bat under your seat?
M	REGIS	Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
M	KATHY LEE	Yes, great movie...
M	REGIS	I was DeNiro!
M	BEEFY	Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
M	NICKY	What can I do about it?
M	BEEFY	You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
M	NICKY	Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
M	BEEFY	Go get a soda out of the fridge.
M	NICKY	But those are my roommate's sodas...
M	BEEFY	"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
M	BEEFY	You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
M	NICKY	Release the evil?
M	BEEFY	I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
M	BEEFY	Release your evil...
M	TODD	What are you doing?
M	TODD	I know it's your living room night. But can I finish watching the Globetrotters' game out here? To me it's classic Comedia Dellarte.
M	BILL WALTON	What an odd game, folks. The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0- 85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans.
M	REF	He's walking, get him a bus!
M	BILL WALTON	Oh, another awful call. There is no way that was traveling.
M	CORNROWS	What's with all these crazy calls? You gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a game in 53 years.
M	REF	Technical foul!
M	NICKY	That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone I know... It looks like the work of a brother...
M	TODD	A black guy?
M	NICKY	If it's Cassius, yes.
M	GLOBETROTTER FAN	Get your head out your ass, ref! The kids came to see the Globetrotters win.
M	REF	Oh, so you wanna lip off to me? Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter's shirt. Take ten points off for the Globetrotters.
M	BILL WALTON	In all my years of basketball, I was never so happy to hear a halftime buzzer. Folk, I'm afraid if the second half doesn't get any better, I expect a full scale riot.
M	COURT ANNOUNCER	It's time for the Globetrotter's halftime half-court heave throw, where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars!
M	COURT ANNOUNCER	And if he makes it, everyone in attendance today will receive a free pizza.
M	MIGUEL	I ain't goin' out there and taking the shot. These people have gone crazy.
M	NICKY	I'll take the shot.
M	PETER	Look who's back from the dead.
M	JOHN	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
M	TODD	What's Nicky doing down there?
M	BEEFY	Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
M	TODD	Did you just talk?
M	BEEFY	No.
M	COURT ANNOUNCER	You better win these people some free pizza. Looks like they're about to start killing each other.
M	NICKY	Release the evil.
M	NICKY	Okay, too much evil..
M	BILL WALTON	I think that ball just blew up. And yes, my hair is aflame.
M	NICKY	Could I get another ball?
M	NICKY	I command you not to blow up and go into that metal circle.
M	REF	Get that crap outta here!
M	NICKY (O.S.)	I know you're having fun, Cassius, but you gotta come back to Hell.
M	CASSIUS (O.S.)	Look around you, Nicky. We're in Hell. The New Hell.
M	NICKY	Listen up, New York. Your souls are in great danger...
M	NICKY	Alright, how about this? I get one more shot. The ref will cover me. I miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game. I make it, he doesn't ref the second half and we all start conducting ourselves like decent human beings again.
M	NICKY	And we get free pizza.
M	BILL WALTON	I think it's safe to say we're all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man.
M	CROWD	Nicky! Nicky! Nicky!
M	NICKY	You know, Dad got very sick when you left.
M	REF	I heard. I'm glad he's dying. It's my turn now.
M	BEEFY	Take him to the hole, Nicky. I mean, woof! Woof!
M	NICKY	Never doubt my skills.
M	CORNROWS	Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.
M	REF	That's nuts. When'd you learn that shit?
M	NICKY	Sorry, Cassius. Maybe it was the super devil juice Dad gave me. HE thought I might need it for just such an occasion.
M	REGIS	Super devil juice? Give it over. Let's go best two out of three.
M	NICKY	No. No way. Dad said it was only for me.
M	CASSIUS (O.S.)	Damn you, Nicky! There ain't no super devil juice in here!
M	TODD	So your father's the devil, you're a talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys are who?
M	PEEPER	Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and the work his Dad does.
M	JOHN	By the way, Nicky. Check this out.
M	JOHN	What's Ozzy trying to say there?
M	NICKY	Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
M	VOICE	I command you in the name of the Lucifer to spread the blood of the innocent.
M	JOHN	No wonder your uncle's so weird...
M	TODD	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
M	PETER	Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix. Tried to spice up the bash.
M	NICKY	What's reefer?
M	JOHN	Come on. One more time.
M	NICKY	Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
M	PETER	Please. You got to.
M	NICKY	All right...
M	BEEFY	I used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend, Heather. We'd get so stoned she would forget I was a dog.
M	JOHN	She was human?
M	BEEFY	Actually, she was a sewer rat. Man, that pissed my parents off.
M	JOHN	I dated a Japanese girl once. My parents disapproved. Not cause she's Japanese, but cause she was only fifteen.
M	NICKY	I'm only fifteen... thousand years old.
M	TODD	I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
M	JOHN	By she, do you mean he?
M	TODD	No.
M	BEEFY	Busted.
M	PETER	How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul Jabar?
M	NICKY	A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
M	TODD	Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
M	JOHN	Easy, Liberace.
M	TODD	Oh, would you grow up.
M	NICKY	life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
M	BEEFY	Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
M	PETER	Me, too. We're gonna get going.
M	TODD	You guys want to stay? I have a futon in my bedroom.
M	JOHN	That's a big pass, Elton John.
M	PETER	We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
M	NICKY	No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
M	JOHN	Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
M	NICKY	See ya, fellas.
M	BEEFY (O.S.)	You better snap out of it soon, kid. Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow. Seven AM. Nighty, night.
M	TODD	That is the most frightening thing I have ever seen.
M	NICKY	Todd. Which way to the Parson's School of Design?
M	NICKY	Coconuts...
M	STUDENT	Hello.
M	NICKY	You smell like coconuts.
M	STUDENT	It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
M	NICKY	No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
M	STUDENT	Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
M	NICKY	Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
M	STUDENT	I don't need luck. I'm good.
M	NICKY	Adrian?
M	STUDENT	Andrew.
M	NICKY	Hey.
F	VALERIE	Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
M	NICKY	Oh that stings! My eyes are on fire!
F	VALERIE	What were you thinking coming here?
M	NICKY	I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
F	VALERIE	Oh my God, I'm so sorry!
F	VALERIE	Nicky?
M	NICKY	Valerie?
F	VALERIE	Are you dead?
M	NICKY	No.
F	VALERIE	What are you doing?
M	NICKY	I think I'm floating.
F	VALERIE	Why would you be floating?
M	NICKY	I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
F	VALERIE	Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
M	NICKY	I can't see you but I can smell you. And you make me feel alive in a way I've never felt before.
M	STUDENT	You got the wrong window again, man.
M	NICKY	Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
F	VALERIE	I'm over here, Nicky! To the left.
F	VALERIE	Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
M	NICKY	That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
F	VALERIE	What do you mean, "possessed?"
M	NICKY	Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
F	VALERIE	Yes...
M	NICKY	Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
F	VALERIE	..."The Devil?"...
M	NICKY	...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
F	VALERIE	Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.
F	VALERIE	I don't know if I should believe you.
M	NICKY	You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
F	VALERIE	Okay, I do. Get back up here.
F	VALERIE	This is amazing.
M	PREACHER	The hellbeast is above us. He's invading our skies! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die!
F	VALERIE	He's kind of ruining the mood.
M	NICKY	Let me take care of that.
M	PREACHER	We're all gonna die!
F	VALERIE	Can we go fly over Central Park?
M	NICKY	Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
F	VALERIE	We're going to Jersey?
M	NICKY	East Rutherford.
M	NICKY	I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead. Please tell me you like metal.
F	VALERIE	"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
M	NICKY	My dog was right. I'm in love with you.
M	NICKY	Moo ya san jie bay!
M	NICKY	What's going on here?
M	NICKY	Ow... what was that for?
M	BUM	Fifty million dollars.
M	NICKY	Release the evil.
M	NICKY	I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
M	BEEFY	The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
M	TODD	Been breaking all morning.
M	DAN RATHER	At a news conference earlier today, Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news. He revealed that the man who caused a sensation at basketball arena last night is no hero... he is, in fact, a mass murderer.
M	NICKY	I didn't murder anybody
M	BEEFY	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
M	NICKY	I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
M	BEEFY	I think you're looking at him.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	This video shows what he did after he left the basketball arena yesterday...
M	GUY	My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all you suckers for no reason!
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	Difficult to watch, I know. In response to this vicious crime, I am authorizing the largest reward in law enforcement history: fifty million dollars to the person or persons who bring this man to me.
M	NICKY	This is baloney!
M	BEEFY	He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
M	TODD	...which is by far DePalma's best work...
M	NICKY	I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
M	PETER	Dude, it's us. Let us in.
M	JOHN	There's like a total mob scene coming this way.
M	NICKY	I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.
M	TODD	Looks like they're following a giant trail of bug shit.
M	PETER	What'll we do now, Beefy?
M	BEEFY	I don't know, this is a little out of my league.
M	VOICES (O.S.)	Come on. Let's get 'em.
M	JOHN	What would your dad do, Nicky?
M	NICKY	Good idea... kill me.
M	PETER	Dude. Seriously?
M	NICKY	Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
M	JOHN AND PETER	Alright!
M	NICKY	That just hurt a lot.
M	TODD	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
M	JOHN	Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.
M	TODD	Die, Grandma, die!
M	LUCIFER	Royal flush, you lose. Off with the bra.
M	LUCIFER	Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big, two hillbillies were blowing on them.
M	NICKY	Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
M	DAD	What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
M	DAD	I got no ears! I can't hear!
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
M	NICKY	Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
M	DAD	I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Check one-two. Check one-two.
M	DAD	Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky. You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
M	PETER	You sure you're down with this?
M	JOHN	Little nervous. Wanna puke.
M	JOHN	Looking for the chief.
M	PETER	We know where to find Nicky.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	You have what I want?
M	JOHN	Sure do. You got what we want?
M	PETER	Fifty million bones, bro.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	That's half of it. You get the rest when I get Nicky.
M	PETER	Excellent. But I gotta warn you, man. He's not human.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	Really?
M	JOHN	We think he's the son of Satan.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra careful. Now where is he?
M	BAG LADY	Hey, watch it! Who do you think you are?
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	Emperor of the New Hell.
M	TODD	Where is he? He's late.
M	BEEFY	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
M	BEEFY	We've been ratted out.
M	TODD	You guys. That was so uncool.
M	PETER	We thought the son of Satan would understand a move like this.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	Okay, take these two outside. I can handle this.
M	CHIEF OF POLICE	Wanna see something cool?
M	ADRIAN	Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
M	JOHN	Noon...
M	JOHN	...ish.
M	PETER	So even though you're not really the chief, we still get the rest of the cash, right bro?
M	ADRIAN	You know what you'll get? An indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity.
M	JOHN	But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
M	ADRIAN	Sure, why not?
F	LADY	Food stamps? They should call 'em "dude stamps." Cause ever time I get one, some dude takes it away...
F	LADY	Hey, studs. I'll let you make out with me for a dollar!
M	JOHN	No thanks... but we'll take that bottle of booze.
F	LADY	Hey... that's mine.
M	PETER	Beat it, ya freak.
M	JOHN	Schnapps...
M	PETER	Peppermint... alright.
M	JOHN	Wanna hit?
M	PETER	Drink up. Here's to fifty million clams.
M	ADRIAN	To the defilement of Earth and the corruption of its people.
M	PETER	Whatever. Knock it back, grab Nicky and let's get outta this hell-hole.
M	ADRIAN	It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
M	JOHN	Weed lowers the body temperature. I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
M	ADRIAN	This liquid will probably quench my thirst. Cool me off.
M	PETER	Definitely.
M	JOHN	And give you a good buzz.
M	ADRIAN	Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
M	JOHN	Uh. No it won't?
M	ADRIAN	Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
M	JOHN	Urr... uggg... errr...
M	ADRIAN	I'm calling you out, brother...
M	JOHN/NICKY	Urrr... uggh... Oww. Adrian, this is very painful.
M	ADRIAN	Hello, Cassius.
M	CASSIUS (O.S.)	All right. Let me out.
M	ADRIAN	You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan. You mother...
M	ADRIAN	But Cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity. So get in the flask.
M	COP	Oh, he's gotta pee.
M	TODD	Run, Beefy! Run!
M	NICKY	I won't drink. You can't make me.
M	ADRIAN	Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
M	NICKY	Let her go.
M	ADRIAN	I hear a train coming. Drink.
F	VALERIE	Don't do it.
M	NICKY	I have to, Valerie.
M	ADRIAN	Ahhh!
M	BEEFY	Now that hurt the both of us.
M	NICKY	Valerie!!!
M	ADRIAN	See you in Hell!
F	ANGEL	Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
F	CHRISTA	So excited.
F	JENNA	She really is.
M	NICKY	That's terrific. Now could you ladies point me to the Black Palace? I should check in with my dad...
F	ANGEL	I'm sorry, you're just so cute.
F	JENNA	Do you have any idea where you are right now?
M	NICKY	The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
F	ANGEL	Maybe try the opposite of that.
F	ANGEL	Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
M	NICKY	My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
F	ANGEL	A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
M	NICKY	My mom wasn't a goat?
F	ANGEL	Try an angel.
M	NICKY	An angel?
F	ANGEL	Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
M	NICKY	Wow. What... what did she look like?
F	ANGEL	Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
F	ANGEL	I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you. I'm your mom.
F	JENNA	I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest look on your face.
F	CHRISTA	You're gonna be so happy she did that.
M	NICKY	How come you're not older?
F	ANGEL	Angels don't get any older, son.
F	JENNA	I can't believe you just called him "son."
F	ANGEL	Oh my God. This is so wild.
M	DAD	I can't see shit. You're all still here, right?
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Adrian's here. You'll be back to normal in a jiffy, sir.
M	DAD LIPS	Yea! I can't believe little Nicky came through.
M	ADRIAN	Where's Nicky?
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	He came with you and Cassius, right?
M	ADRIAN	I came through that gate alone.
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Sorry, sir, false alarm.
M	DAD	Boooo.
M	ADRIAN	Somebody explain what's going on.
M	GATEKEEPER	You'll get nothing out of me.
M	ADRIAN	Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips.
M	GATEKEEPER	The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely.
M	ADRIAN	How much time does Dad have before that happens?
M	GATEKEEPER	Thirty minutes. And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power.
M	LUCIFER	All boobs and no balls.
M	ADRIAN	Thirty minutes. Hmmm. I hope you don't mind if I take a seat while I wait for you.
M	DAD LIPS	Ahhh!
M	LUCIFER	I don't get no respect.
M	ADRIAN	Ten thousand years. And I never once got to sit here.
M	ADRIAN	Wow. And this is just a little taste of my power.
M	DAD	Hell's gonna bust wide open. Demons, get him out of the chair!
M	ADRIAN	Ah-ah. Not so fast, demons. There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested. Anyone interested?
M	NICKY	Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?
F	CHRISTA	No, their mother's weren't angels.
F	ANGEL	I think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like...
M	CHUBBS	Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo lesson.
F	ANGEL	Oh, Chubbs. I totally spaced. I'm so sorry. I have company. It's my son, Nicky. My son. Can you believe it?
M	CHUBBS	Wow, that's terrific.
F	ANGEL	Nicky, this is Chubbs. He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor.
M	CHUBBS	You mambo?
M	NICKY	I don't think so.
M	CHUBBS	Remember, it's all in the hips. It's all in the hips.
M	NICKY	Where did you meet my father?
F	ANGEL	It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
F	CHRISTA	I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
F	ANGEL	Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
F	JENNA	He was really conceited.
F	ANGEL	But I don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body.
M	NICKY	And that made you want to make a baby with him?
F	ANGEL	Well, I really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time!
F	ANGEL	Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back... Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye. That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
M	NICKY	Well tell her I said "hi" back.
F	ANGEL	I'll call her later.
F	CHRISTA	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
F	JENNA	That was so cool.
F	ANGEL	That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell. Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here.
M	NICKY	How did you see me?
F	ANGEL	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
M	ANGEL (O.S.)	All these good people have totally been led astray. Show him Central Park.
M	ANGEL (O.S.)	There's like a three day rave goin' on down there. No on is going to work anymore.
M	ADRIAN	Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here. Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay? Let's see...
M	DAD LIPS	I was a good Devil, wasn't I?
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	You were the best Devil, boss, the best Devil!
M	GATEKEEPER	Absolutely.
M	DAD LIPS	I tried to do some interesting stuff...
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	You did amazing stuff!
M	GATEKEEPER	I don't know how you came up with some of it.
M	DAD LIPS	Really? That means a lot to me.
M	JENNA (O.S.)	Oh my God. He looks gross. I can't believe I did it with him.
M	ADRIAN	I'm very proud of you. You've taken to sin with minimal prompting.
M	ADRIAN	You're acting as if there is no Heaven or Hell.
M	ADRIAN	Well, I have some news.
M	CARDINAL	There is most definitely a Hell! And you're all going there when you die! Which will happen in about fifteen minutes.
M	PREACHER	We really are gonna die!
M	PETER	This don't look good.
M	JOHN	Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
M	TODD	They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
M	BEEFY	I can't screw. I can't screw.
M	NICKY	Valerie's crying!
F	ANGEL	She's so nice.
F	CHRISTA	She goes to Parson's, right?
F	ANGEL	I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
M	NICKY	I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
F	ANGEL	Yeah, you do...
M	ADRIAN (V.O.)	At the stroke of midnight, my father will be completely deteriorated. And all of your souls will be mine.
M	ADRIAN	Soon you will see things more horrible than you can even imagine.
M	ADRIAN	Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.
M	ADRIAN	So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I bring you a dear sweet man and an international icon... Henry Winkler!
M	ADRIAN	Covered in bees!
M	NICKY	But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
F	ANGEL	Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
M	NICKY	A speech impediment?
F	ANGEL	No, you have the inner light. You can totally use it. It's the best power of all. And in case you get in real bad trouble, God told me to give you this.
M	NICKY	What is it?
F	ANGEL	I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
F	CHRISTA	God's so smart.
F	JENNA	The smartest.
F	ANGEL	Well, goodbye... for now. Can I just do this?
F	ANGEL	That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?
M	FRIEND	Totally.
M	NICKY	Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
F	ANGEL	It would be so okay.
M	NICKY	Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane. You're already there...
M	NICKY	Release... the good.
M	NICKY	Release the good...
M	NICKY	Release the awesome.
M	NICKY	Put it in your mouth and let it slide down your throat-hole.
M	DEMON	Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
M	TODD	One thing I really regret is never having experimented sexually.
M	PETER	You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen Burner? What are you talking about?
M	JOHN	He means getting it on with someone like that freak.
M	TODD	His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
M	JOHN	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
M	ADRIAN	You know, from this angle, you're kind of cute.
F	VALERIE	You think so? Why don't you come a little closer and I'll show you a better angle.
M	ADRIAN	Yummy.
M	TODD	Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
M	BEEFY	That turn you on there, RuPaul?
M	ADRIAN	Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
M	JOHN	You want a queen? Got one right here.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	Little Nicky.
M	NICKY	Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
M	ADRIAN	Is this a joke?
M	NICKY	No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
M	REFORMED DEMON	It's true!
M	ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON	It's not true?
M	NICKY	Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no choice.
M	NICKY	Love lifts me up where I belong.
M	ADRIAN	Not bad, little brother. Let's see what you've got.
M	ADRIAN	Enough. I'm going to kill you with my bare hands.
F	ANGEL	I totally had to do that.
M	ALL THE GIRLS	Yah you did.
M	NICKY	Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the flas...
M	NICKY	Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!
M	NICKY	Now will you get in the flask?
M	ADRIAN	Absolutely not.
M	ADRIAN	A little help over here.
M	ADRIAN	Henry!
M	HENRY WINKLER	Oh no.
M	ADRIAN	Goodbye, Nicky.
M	CASSIUS (O.S.)	Come on in, bro.
M	CASSIUS	Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear. Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I heard him keep saying.
F	VALERIE	Nicky! That was Cassius!
M	DEMON	Kill him, Adrian.
F	VALERIE	Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
M	NICKY	From my dad's side of the family.
M	ADRIAN	What? No tongue?
F	VALERIE	Nicky. Nicky.
F	VALERIE	You gotta fly out... I know you can do it. Do it for the butterflies. Butterflies...
M	OZZY	Hello, New York.
M	JOHN AND PETER	Ozzy.
F	VALERIE	Put him in, Ozzy.
F	VALERIE	Grand Central, Nicky. Start running.
M	JOHN	He'll never make it.
M	PETER	You gotta kill yourself.
M	NICKY	I'll just go to Heaven.
M	BEEFY	Not if you do something bad right before you die.
M	HENRY WINKLER	Aw, man, not again.
M	NICKY	Sorry, Henry. Release the Evil.
M	NICKY	Do me.
F	VALERIE	I love you.
M	NICKY	I love you.
F	ANGEL	Okay, you just saw my son save the universe. Right?!
M	DAD	You came through, Nicky.
M	NICKY	I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
M	DAD	You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
M	NICKY	What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
M	DAD	Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
F	ANGEL	Oh my God. He's totally talking about me.
M	DAD	And don't think I forgot about how crazy you get after a few daiquiris.
M	FRIEND	That guy is still a horn dog.
M	DAD	Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
M	NICKY	I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
M	JIMMY THE DEMON	Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time for Hitler's punishment.
M	LUCIFER	Let me handle that.
M	LUCIFER	And I'm not using a pineapple this time.
M	ADRIAN (O.S.)	No! Don't do it!
M	HITLER	Holy Schnit!
F	LADY	Oh... what an uncommonly beautiful baby.
F	VALERIE	Thank you.
F	LADY	Such a little angel.
M	BEEFY	Only a quarter, ma'am.
M	NICKY	Zachariah, say you're sorry.
M	BABY ZACHARIAH	Sorry.
M	PREACHER	He has spilled his seed! He is multiplying! Beware the progeny of the unholy union! We're all gonna die!
M	THE END
