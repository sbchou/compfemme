M	written by	Andrew Kevin Walker first
M	CAB DRIVER	Where to?
F	WELLES	Follow that limousine. Don't get too close, don't let it get too far away. Just keep with it.
M	CAB DRIVER	You kidding?
F	WELLES	Nope.
M	CAB DRIVER	Uh, listen... you're not supposed to be smoking in here. I'm sorry, that's company policy...
F	WELLES	How about this... every cigarette I smoke, I give you five dollars?
M	CAB DRIVER	Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good...
M	OLDER WOMAN	Thank you.
F	AMY	Welcome home.
F	WELLES	Do you know how much I missed you?
F	AMY	What's this... have you been smoking... ?
F	WELLES	Smoking? I'm not smoking.
F	AMY	Your clothing reeks of it.
F	WELLES	You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing? Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
F	AMY	I'm not accusing you...
F	WELLES	Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
F	AMY	Okay, I believe you.
F	WELLES	We've been all through that. I've been on my best behavior.
F	WELLES	Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss me? I sure missed you...
F	WELLES	Let's get my bags and get the hell out of here.
F	AMY	How's the detective business?
F	WELLES	Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
F	AMY	You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
F	WELLES	Honey, I'm not, please...
F	AMY	I love you.
F	WELLES	I love you.
F	WELLES	What's all the trouble, Cinderella? What are you crying about, huh?
F	WELLES	Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night. The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman. It's unpleasant, I know. I apologize...
M	POLITICIAN	None too discreet, is he?
F	WELLES	No, sir, he is not.
M	POLITICIAN	He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
F	WELLES	The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
M	POLITICIAN	Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
F	WELLES	Certainly, Senator. If I can ever be of further assistance.
F	AMY	You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
F	WELLES	Sure. I'll call the guy.
F	AMY	You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
F	WELLES	I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
F	AMY	Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
F	WELLES	Hello. Yes... could you hold on a minute...?
F	WELLES	Okay, I've got it. Hello... sorry, I was switching phones. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian. Yes. Yes, I understand... tomorrow evening should be fine...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
F	WELLES	I try to be.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	I appreciate your coming on such short notice.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney.
F	WELLES	Uh huh, pleasure.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
M	LONGDALE	Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
F	WELLES	I'm listening.
M	LONGDALE	As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
F	WELLES	Of what sort?
M	LONGDALE	You are a private investigator?
F	WELLES	That's right.
M	LONGDALE	Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Yes, how theatrical. So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
F	WELLES	Thank you.
F	WELLES	He's odd.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.
F	WELLES	I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
F	WELLES	My condolences.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
F	WELLES	I'll do whatever I can to help.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	His inner sanctum.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Not many people have been inside this room.
F	WELLES	Pittsburgh?
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.
F	WELLES	He succeeded.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him. I loved him deeply.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
F	WELLES	I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Just curious.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.
F	WELLES	You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize...
F	WELLES	Do you want to tell me what you found?
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Cash, stock certificates, and this...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
F	WELLES	I'm afraid I don't...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	This is a movie showing a girl being murdered. She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...
F	WELLES	Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film." But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth. Like, red light district folklore. There's no such thing, I can assure you.
F	WELLES	Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	No.
F	WELLES	If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	I'm telling you it's not that.
F	WELLES	I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Will you watch it and see for yourself?
F	WELLES	Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
F	WELLES	You... you need to go to the police.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	I told you I can't, not yet.
F	WELLES	You don't have any other choice.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
F	WELLES	It won't work like that.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. I've thought about it and there's no other way. If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen. I'm telling you I won't. If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
F	WELLES	I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	You've found missing persons before.
F	WELLES	Nothing remotely like this.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	I know what I'm asking. Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her.
F	WELLES	This is the mortgage. This is Cindy's college money.
F	AMY	I understand.
F	WELLES	Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.
F	AMY	I know.
F	WELLES	It's a missing persons case... a long shot. I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back. We'll take a vacation.
F	AMY	Why the gun?
F	WELLES	I'm not gonna need it. I won't even wear it. It's a precaution. Don't worry about me.
F	WELLES	Hello, honey, it's me. I'm fine, how are you?
M	DIRECTOR	What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
F	WELLES	Call me Tom.
M	DIRECTOR	Alright, Tom.
F	WELLES	What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
M	DIRECTOR	There are reasons for the way we do things here.
F	WELLES	Absolutely. Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
F	WELLES	Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
M	DIRECTOR	Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
F	WELLES	I figured you share information.
M	DIRECTOR	We do.
F	WELLES	For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
M	DIRECTOR	Why don't they come to me?
F	WELLES	This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
M	DIRECTOR	I'm not so sure about this.
F	WELLES	They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
M	DIRECTOR	I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
F	WELLES	They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
M	DIRECTOR	Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.
F	WELLES	Who knows... maybe she's already given her parents a call, right?
F	WELLES	Fuck.
M	DIRECTOR	Excuse me... Tom, hold on...
M	DIRECTOR	Listen, maybe I can help after all. Why don't you come on back in... we'll see what we can do.
M	DIRECTOR	This is it. It's not much. We've got less than five percent on computer and we lose that funding in December. I'll have someone show it to you anyway. Other than that, I'm afraid it's the wet thumb method.
M	DIRECTOR	Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance. We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
F	WELLES	Any good?
M	DIRECTOR	It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
F	WELLES	You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
M	DIRECTOR	It's good what you're doing.
F	WELLES	Hello, Mrs. Christian? Tom Welles. Here's where we stand. I checked the film stock and it's called Supra- lux 544. The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92... Yeah, about five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary... Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did. First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo... Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative. Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around...
M	WELLES (V.O., cont)	There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact... It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it...
M	WELLES (V.O., cont)	There were three men. Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror. It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching...
M	WELLES (V.O., cont)	So, there were three. They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to. That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago...
M	WELLES (V.O., cont)	Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was. I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.
M	MRS MATHEWS	Yes... ?
F	WELLES	Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
F	WELLES	I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
M	MRS MATHEWS	I don't understand, who are... ?
F	WELLES	I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
M	MRS MATHEWS	Yes, but...
F	WELLES	These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different. I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
F	WELLES	What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
M	MRS MATHEWS	Neil... Neil Cole.
F	WELLES	Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
M	MRS MATHEWS	No.
F	WELLES	Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair. Born April 24, 1976. Missing June 11th, 1992. A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
F	WELLES	I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy. Is there a more convenient time... ? Can I buy you lunch, would that be alright?
F	WELLES	It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
M	MRS MATHEWS	They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
F	WELLES	That's exactly what I am.
M	MRS MATHEWS	I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
F	WELLES	You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat. Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh? And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
F	WELLES	It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you.
F	WELLES	So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
M	MRS MATHEWS	No.
F	WELLES	She just seemed... depressed... ?
M	MRS MATHEWS	She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.
F	WELLES	What was she running from?
M	MRS MATHEWS	I don't know.
F	WELLES	If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
M	MRS MATHEWS	Yes.
F	WELLES	September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
M	MRS MATHEWS	We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
F	WELLES	Why do you think he did it?
M	MRS MATHEWS	It got to be too much for him.
F	WELLES	You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
M	MRS MATHEWS	There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
F	WELLES	I didn't mean to...
M	MRS MATHEWS	You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
F	WELLES	I had to ask. I apologize.
M	MRS MATHEWS	No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
M	MRS MATHEWS	People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
F	WELLES	Of course.
M	MRS MATHEWS	This is her room.
M	MRS MATHEWS	The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it. every year she's missed. They'll be waiting for her when she comes back.
F	WELLES	I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
M	MRS MATHEWS	Okay.
F	WELLES	You should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left, honey. Call him back and tell him I said so. The goddamn thing's still under warranty. I'm okay. It's hard here. It's hard. I've got a lead I have to follow through. To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get very far. I miss you. I love you.
M	MRS MATHEWS	We weren't religious. We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids. We never made her go to church. But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious.
M	MRS MATHEWS	Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church.
F	WELLES	We're all like that.
M	MRS MATHEWS	Are you religious?
F	WELLES	No.
M	MRS MATHEWS	You should be.
F	WELLES	I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
M	MRS MATHEWS	What?
F	WELLES	It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
M	MRS MATHEWS	There wasn't one. The police looked.
F	WELLES	Do you think the police did a good job?
M	MRS MATHEWS	I don't know. I think so.
F	WELLES	It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...
M	MRS MATHEWS	No. You don't have any reason to think that...
F	WELLES	If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
M	MRS MATHEWS	How... how can you say that to me...?
F	WELLES	Will you let me look?
M	MRS MATHEWS	My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
F	WELLES	You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They could have missed something. They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know?
M	MRS MATHEWS	Go ahead and look if you want. I don't care what you do.
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)	"Dear mom. If you're reading this, it means I called you from Hollywood, California and told you where to find my diary. I don't think I'll be able to tell you this when I talk to you, so I'm writing it down here. You know I haven't been happy for a long, long time. For a long time now dad's been doing things I couldn't tell you. He's been touching me and it's getting worse. I can't stay anymore. I know you and I haven't always gotten along sometimes, but please don't blame yourself. There isn't anything you can do. I'm going to make a whole new life in California. Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or in magazines. Don't worry about me. Love, Mary Anne."
F	WELLES	You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
M	MRS MATHEWS	Yes.
F	WELLES	Do you ever consider... do you realize that Mary may never come back?
M	MRS MATHEWS	I think about it everyday. But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
F	WELLES	It's been six years.
M	MRS MATHEWS	What am I supposed to do? Forget her? Time heals all wounds, right? She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that. But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her... ... or her being dead and me knowing... I'd choose to know.
F	WELLES	Excuse me, I have to use your bathroom.
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)	"Dear diary. I have a big math test tomorrow. I have to get better grades. How come everybody does better than me? Kathy doesn't even study and she gets B's. Two boys got in a fight after school today. One boy knocked the other boy's tooth out, at least that's what it looked like. His nose and mouth were bleeding all over the place..."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)	"... We're reading The Great Gatsby in English class. It's the story of this guy who has lots of fancy parties and all his friends come around and party with him, but later when he dies nobody comes to his funeral. Someone said there's a movie about it, but I looked in the video store and it wasn't there."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)	"Dear diary. I started my first job last week working part time at Price Mart department store..."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"... The people I work with are all old and fat. All they live for is their next coffee break so they can smoke..." "... They eat lunch at the snack counter. Hot dogs and soft pretzels. Nachos with that orange cheese that comes out of a pump. I don't know what I'd do if I'm still working there when I get old..."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"... I want to be a singer or an actress. I know it's a stupid dream, but I know I can do it if I get a chance..." "... Everyone's always telling me how pretty I am. I don't think I am. When I look in the mirror I wonder who they're talking about."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"Dear diary. I went out with Bob today, the cute boy in my science class. He took me to a movie..."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"... It was the middle of the day, but we held hands. I think he likes me. I really like him. He has black hair and grey eyes..." "... He opened the car door for me and paid for the movie. When he took me home he said we should go out again soon. I hope he calls..." "Dear diary. Janet says she slept with her boyfriend. I can't believe it. She says they did it last weekend while her parents were out of town..."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"... She said she liked it, but she didn't seem too happy. She didn't tell me many details. She said he used a condom."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"Dear diary. If I save enough money to go to community college maybe I can get good enough grades for a scholarship somewhere else..."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"... I've never been anywhere else. I don't think mom wants to let me go. Every time I try to talk about it she says it'll cost too much or she changes the subject." "Dear diary. Something terrible happened today when dad and I were alone. I can't tell anyone. I feel sick. What did I ever do to make this happen to me?"
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"Dear diary. My stomach hurts all the time. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I want to get out of my head and stop hearing myself think."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"Dear diary. Grandma fell and broke her leg last week. We drove down to visit her in the hospital. Hospitals smell like dead people." "Dear diary. It's happening all the time now. There s nothing I can do. I'm all alone. Everything is bad. I used to have lots of dreams and I'd remember them when I woke up, but that doesn't happen anymore." "Dear diary. If I can get to California, I'll be okay. I've got money saved. I can work as a waitress till I get something better. Billy says he and his family went to California once on vacation. He says it never rains. They stayed near the beach and he went swimming in the ocean..."
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)	"... I hope I can be an actress. I hope I can be happy. I'll probably have to go to acting school. I wish I knew someone who lived there. I'll miss my friends, but at least I'll be far away where no one can ever find me."
F	WELLES	Is this pretty much it?
F	WELLES	Just... just videos?
M	PIERCED CLERK	What are you looking for?
F	WELLES	Nothing.
M	PIERCED CLERK	Fuck-head.
M	MAX	Big date tonight?
F	WELLES	Yeah... guess so.
M	MAX	Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
F	WELLES	Pardon me?
M	MAX	My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
F	WELLES	Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
M	MAX	It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
F	WELLES	I'll risk it.
M	MAX	Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore. Have a nice day.
F	WELLES	What are you reading?
M	MAX	Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
F	WELLES	Catchy title. What are you really reading? Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
F	WELLES	Truman Capote.
M	MAX	I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is.
F	WELLES	Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
M	MAX	Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
F	WELLES	Hi, honey, how are you? How's Cindy? The way it's going I'm about ready to pack my bags...
M	WELLES' VOICE (V.O.)	... I've got a feeling the person I'm looking for came out here and got swallowed up by the place.
M	AMY'S VOICE (V.O.)	Come back now. Just drop it and come back... I would if I could. I'll be home soon, believe me. It won't be long. I miss you.
F	WELLES	I miss you too. I love you very much. Give Cinderella a kiss for me and tell her I love her, alright? Goodnight.
F	WELLES	Remember me?
M	MAX	Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right? Told you you would.
F	WELLES	I need some information. Thought you might be able to help.
M	MAX	Thomas Welles. Nice picture.
F	WELLES	I'll be outside having a cigarette.
M	MAX	Cover me, Beth. I'm taking a break.
M	MAX	I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
F	WELLES	Good for you.
F	WELLES	How long you been working there?
M	MAX	Three, four years.
F	WELLES	What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
M	MAX	Max.
F	WELLES	Well, here's the deal, Max. This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
M	MAX	There's not much illegal.
F	WELLES	Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know. I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great. If not, speak now.
M	MAX	You're not a cop, are you? If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
F	WELLES	I'm not a cop.
M	MAX	You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
F	WELLES	Not quite.
M	MAX	From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
F	WELLES	Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
M	MAX	How much?
F	WELLES	How much do you make now?
M	MAX	Four hundred a week, off the books.
F	WELLES	Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
M	MAX	Sounds good, pops.
F	WELLES	Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
M	MAX	Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
F	WELLES	See you then. Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
F	WELLES	... Hello... ? Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.
M	MAX	Come on.
M	GOON	Are you a law enforcement agent or in any way affiliated with law enforcement?
M	MAX	Fuck you, Larry.
M	GOON	Are you a law enforcement... ?
F	WELLES	No.
M	ONE DEALER	We're shutting down in fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes.
F	WELLES	What are these?
M	ANGRY DEALER	Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.
F	WELLES	Anything harder?
M	ANGRY DEALER	There's nothing harder.
F	WELLES	Snuff?
M	ANGRY DEALER	What you see is what I got, mister.
F	WELLES	You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.
M	ANGRY DEALER	There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
M	LARGE MAN	You have to pay to come in here.
M	MAX	You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there's mainstream hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That's hardcore. That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a week. A week. They've even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves pornography. Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying. Somebody's buying those videos. Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex. Know what else? It's only gonna get worse. More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution. Desensitization. Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive! Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. Know what I mean? For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while. They have to be the biggest tits ever. Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
F	WELLES	Interesting theory.
M	MAX	What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend. We're talking about stuff where people get hurt. Specialty product.
F	WELLES	Child pornography.
M	MAX	There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line. How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not? Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. Rape films, but there aren't many. I've never seen one.
F	WELLES	Snuff films.
M	MAX	I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing.
F	WELLES	What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?
M	MAX	First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer. It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet. Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants. It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em. But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes. No one knows where it comes from. That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. Those are zombies, hardcore junkies. Their hands are permanently pruned. They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister. Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes. Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations. Interstate wire transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows? That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal. There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
F	WELLES	How old are you?
M	MAX	Twenty-five.
F	WELLES	Where are your parents?
M	MAX	I don't know, where are yours?
F	WELLES	I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
M	MAX	I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about?
F	WELLES	You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
M	MAX	Yeah, I'm a real genius. What choices have I got? Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it. I work a job. It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
F	WELLES	You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
M	MAX	You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb. So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver? Go to Harvard? Run for President? What about you, pops?
F	WELLES	What about me?
M	MAX	I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
F	WELLES	A daughter.
M	MAX	So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
F	WELLES	Good question.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	My husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits. Between November of 1991 and March of 1992, he wrote one check out to cash from each account. He wrote these himself...
F	WELLES	Okay... My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
F	WELLES	I'm not positive this means anything.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)	The checks were for odd amounts...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents... Okay, I follow you so far...
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
F	WELLES	You're joking.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)	To the penny. Exactly one million dollars in cash.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)	Hello... ?
F	WELLES	I'm here. Do you think the film could have cost that much?
F	WELLES	For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations. Who knows? It sure could have. I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)	Okay.
F	WELLES	Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?
M	MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)	You told me to look, so I looked.
F	WELLES	You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
F	WELLES	Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.
F	NUN	Yes... I remember Mary
F	WELLES	You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
F	NUN	Yes. I remember her.
F	NUN	She lived here for only about a month, if I recall correctly. She didn't return one night. She never came back. I didn't know what to think...
F	NUN	Do you know what happened to her?
F	WELLES	I'm trying to find out. She was a runaway. I'm looking into it for her parents.
F	NUN	Can you get that down for me?
F	NUN	No, the next shelf... there...
F	WELLES	What is this?
F	NUN	Those are her belongings.
F	WELLES	Her belongings?
F	NUN	That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
F	WELLES	Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
F	NUN	She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she'd be back. After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things. Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
F	WELLES	I'll do what I can.
M	MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)	"Star light, star bright, First star I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish I might, Have this wish I wish tonight."
M	MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)	Celebrity Films.
F	WELLES	This is better. This will be fine.
F	WELLES	No thank you.
F	WELLES	Okay, I'll take it all.
M	SALESPERSON	Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
F	WELLES	Cash.
M	SALESPERSON	Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
F	WELLES	No, you may not.
M	SALESPERSON	Okay. Fine.
M	SALESPERSON	I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
F	WELLES	Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
M	SALESPERSON	Certainly, sir.
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	... half a dozen. This is good stuff, Jimbo...
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.
M	MALE VOICE (V.O.)	I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month. Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
M	MALE VOICE (V.O.)	The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff? Look, you cocksucker...
M	MALE VOICE (V.O.)	Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head. Till then, fuck you. Fuck you!
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Celebrity Films.
M	WELLES (V.O.)	Eddie. Yeah, who's this? I know what you did. What? I know what you did. Who is this.
M	WELLES (V.O.)	You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago... What the fuck are you.. ?
M	WELLES (V.O.)	You killed that girl and you put it on film. You and your pals, you're fucked. You fucked up real good.
F	WELLES	Come on, Eddie...
M	WELLES (O.S.)	... come on...
M	MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)	... Hello? Dino, it's Eddie... Eddie Poole... What do you want? I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop. What are you talking about?
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
M	DINO (V.O.)	Bullshit. I'm telling you... Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible. Why are you bothering me with this... ?
M	EDDIE (V.O.)	Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out! There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt. Think about it. There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything. I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader. Dino... Nobody knows anything.
F	WELLES	That is you, isn't it, Eddie?
M	WELLES VOICE (V.O.)	... and your pals, you're fucked...
F	WELLES	Two one two.
M	"Dino Velvet/D.V. Films	1204 Keller Street New York, NY 10049"
F	WELLES	What do you know about a guy called Dino Velvet? Dino Velvet Films?
M	MAX	Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
M	WELLES (V.O.)	A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
M	MAX	His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.
M	WELLES (V.O.)	Specialty product.
M	MAX	You're learning.
M	WELLES (V.O.)	Where does he sell it?
M	MAX	Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look. He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
M	MAX (V.O.)	Nothing illegal, it's always borderline. Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
F	WELLES	Alright, I get the picture.
M	MAX (V.O.)	He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
F	WELLES	Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
M	MAX (V.O.)	I'm a working stiff, pops.
F	WELLES	Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
M	MAX (V.O.)	You want me to come out there and play private eye?
F	WELLES	Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back. See ya.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Hello?
M	WELLES (V.O.)	Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	How are you? Having any luck?
M	WELLES (V.O.)	I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
M	WELLES (V.O.)	I hope it's nothing serious.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
F	WELLES	I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)	Fine...
F	WELLES	I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
M	MRS CHRISTIAN	How will I get it to you?
F	WELLES	If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
M	MAX	You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
F	WELLES	It's their Presidential Suite.
M	MAX	Great.
M	MAX	Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
F	WELLES	It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
M	MAX	Dino Velvet.
F	WELLES	Max... wake up...
M	MAX	Wha... ?
F	WELLES	Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
M	MAX	He's one of the lunatics Dino uses. He's in a bunch of these.
M	MAX	Why? He have something to do with whatever you're into?
F	WELLES	No... it's nothing... that's not him.
F	WELLES	Who is he?
M	MAX	I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
F	WELLES	Who is he, his name?
M	MAX	Nobody knows his name. That's his thing. He always wears a mask. You never see his face. He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him. Machine.
M	MAX	They say he's half brain-dead from all the steroids he's using.
M	MAX	He's a brutal motherfucker, man. He loves what he does for a living.
F	WELLES	You don't need to be here.
M	MAX	What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
M	MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)	Who is it?
M	THUG	You're in the wrong place.
F	WELLES	We're looking for Mr. Velvet.
M	THUG	He's not here.
F	WELLES	Why don't you tell him we're here to give him a large sum of money. If he's not interested, we'll go.
M	THUG	You should leave now, before I have to remove you.
M	DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.)	Show them in, Milo.
F	WELLES	You heard the boss, Milo.
M	DINO VELVET	Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
F	WELLES	It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
M	DINO VELVET	What can I do for you today?
F	WELLES	I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.
M	DINO VELVET	Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
F	WELLES	A fellow investor.
M	DINO VELVET	Hmm.
M	MAX	You're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video. Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.
M	DINO VELVET	Well, I'm glad you appreciate it. What would you say is your favorite piece?
M	MAX	I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
F	WELLES	"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
M	DINO VELVET	You said something about money.
F	WELLES	Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.
F	WELLES	That's five thousand dollars.
M	DINO VELVET	Is it?
F	WELLES	Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
M	DINO VELVET	And they are?
F	WELLES	I want to watch you work.
M	DINO VELVET	I'll consider it.
F	WELLES	And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
M	DINO VELVET	Machine.
F	WELLES	If it's not him, there's no deal.
M	DINO VELVET	He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
F	WELLES	We can do that.
M	DINO VELVET	Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? Very good.
M	DINO VELVET	You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
F	WELLES	I'd rather you didn't.
M	DINO VELVET	What's the problem?
F	WELLES	I'm camera shy.
M	DINO VELVET	You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
F	WELLES	Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.
F	WELLES	So, what do you say?
M	DINO VELVET	I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars.
M	WELLES (V.O.)	Machine's in?
M	DINO VELVET	He's in. It will be his pleasure.
M	DINO VELVET (V.O.)	Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three o'clock, tomorrow.
F	WELLES	Where's that?
M	DINO VELVET (V.O.)	Brooklyn. Don't be late.
M	MAX	What's next?
F	WELLES	I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.
M	MAX	Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
F	WELLES	Nope.
F	WELLES	This is for you.
M	MAX	What's this?
F	WELLES	It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.
M	MAX	Look... that's awful generous and everything...
F	WELLES	It's not my money. The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought. Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay? Go be a race car driver. Go run for President. Whatever.
F	WELLES	I'll see you around.
M	DINO VELVET	There you are. Come join us.
F	WELLES	Hello.
M	DINO VELVET	You brought the money?
F	WELLES	Right here.
M	DINO VELVET	Excellent.
F	WELLES	Where are the women?
M	DINO VELVET	They should be here any minute.
F	WELLES	What are these for?
M	DINO VELVET	Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
F	WELLES	Sure.
M	DINO VELVET	Machine and I were just talking about knifes. The beauty of knifes...
M	DINO VELVET	He was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp. The ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing...
M	DINO VELVET	So close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so non-intrusive. Flesh is fooled. It blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage.
M	DINO VELVET	Ah, ours guests have arrived.
M	DINO VELVET	Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
F	WELLES	What are you... ?
M	DINO VELVET	Take out your gun!
M	DINO VELVET	Slowly. Let me see it.
M	DINO VELVET	Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
F	WELLES	Look, I don't know what this...
M	DINO VELVET	Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
M	EDDIE	Is that him?
M	DINO VELVET	Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.
M	DINO VELVET	Didn't know what to make of you at first, and you certainly had Eddie on pins and needles. But, lo and behold, from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to explain everything...
M	EDDIE	This is the fucker? Motherfucker, doesn't look like anything...
M	EDDIE	Doesn't look like shit.
M	DINO VELVET	You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
F	WELLES	I remember him.
M	LONGDALE	Let's get this over with.
M	DINO VELVET	Fine idea.
M	DINO VELVET	You're going to go get the film you received from Mrs. Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand. And to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive...
F	WELLES	No...
M	DINO VELVET	Friend of yours?
F	WELLES	Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
M	DINO VELVET	Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
F	WELLES	He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
M	DINO VELVET	Bring the film, or we kill him.
F	WELLES	I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
M	DINO VELVET	How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company.
M	DINO VELVET	Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
M	EDDIE	Move it, dirtbag... !
M	DINO VELVET	Do hurry.
F	WELLES	You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
M	LONGDALE	Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
F	WELLES	So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy. And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
M	LONGDALE	That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
F	WELLES	Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
M	LONGDALE	I was well compensated.
F	WELLES	That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. How'd you find me?
M	LONGDALE	Never mind how I found you.
F	WELLES	Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
M	LONGDALE	They're no friends of mine.
F	WELLES	Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
M	LONGDALE	None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone. If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. A girl no one even remembers.
F	WELLES	Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name. Her mom remembers her.
F	WELLES	You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one. Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
M	LONGDALE	Shut up.
F	WELLES	Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
M	LONGDALE	Shut your mouth and drive!
F	WELLES	Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up? Tell me, because I really want to understand. Did he jerk off to it? You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
M	LONGDALE	You're making me very angry.
F	WELLES	Just tell me. Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
M	LONGDALE	You're asking me why?
F	WELLES	I'm asking.
M	LONGDALE	A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
F	WELLES	Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
M	LONGDALE	Isn't it incredibly obvious?
F	WELLES	Enlighten me.
M	LONGDALE	Because he could. He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for?
M	LONGDALE	You've got four minutes till I call Mr. Velvet and let him know there's a problem.
M	MANAGER	May I show you to a booth...
F	WELLES	No, I've got it.
M	LONGDALE	You almost went over your limit.
F	WELLES	Fuck you.
M	LONGDALE	Give me the film.
F	WELLES	You'll get it when we get there.
M	LONGDALE	Give me the film.
F	WELLES	Go ahead, shoot me. Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
F	WELLES	No!!
F	WELLES	You fuckers!
M	EDDIE	You're a dead man.
M	DINO VELVET	Leave him alone.
M	EDDIE	Fuck off.
M	EDDIE	What the fuck... !
F	DINO	I promised him to Machine.
M	EDDIE	... sorry...
M	DINO VELVET	First things first. You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
F	WELLES	Don't... please...
M	DINO VELVET	And so it ends. It's as if she never existed.
M	DINO VELVET	Don't blame yourself. You were in way over your head.
F	WELLES	Motherfuckers. Small time, motherfuckers... ! Tell me something...
F	WELLES	I know why you did it, Dino, Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do it? Must have been a helluva lot of money, right? One fuckload of money...
F	WELLES	So, what are you all still doing small time, huh? What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie?! Christian gave Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film. How much did you ever see... ?
M	EDDIE	What's he talking about?
F	WELLES	One million dollars, Dino. How much did he tell you he had...
M	LONGDALE	He's lying.
F	WELLES	Look at him. You think he played it square? How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
M	EDDIE	What the fuck's he talking about?
M	LONGDALE	Stay away from me.
M	DINO VELVET	What's going on, Longdale? Did this happen?
M	EDDIE	You sell us short, you fuck?
M	LONGDALE	Stay back! You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me. Now!
M	LONGDALE	Put it on the ground, kick it here...
M	EDDIE	You fucking lawyer...
M	LONGDALE	Move back! All of you... move!
M	DINO VELVET	What were you thinking?
M	LONGDALE	Back off! Everything's been taken care of, and I'm leaving now...
M	DINO VELVET	You're not going anywhere if you fucked us, lawyer.
M	LONGDALE	I'm leaving.
M	EDDIE	You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
M	DINO VELVET	You betrayed us.
M	LONGDALE	Stay where you are!
M	LONGDALE	Keep back!
M	DINO VELVET	You're not gonna live through this.
M	LONGDALE	Our business is done, I'm leaving, no one's going to stop me...
M	DINO VELVET	Fuck you!
M	EDDIE	Fuck.
M	MACHINE (O.S.)	NO!
M	MACHINE	He's mine! Machine starts this way...
F	WELLES	No, no, no... please, don't kill me... please... !
M	EDDIE	Do him good.
F	WELLES	Back off, Eddie...
F	WELLES	Stop Eddie!
F	WELLES	I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in the back... !
F	WELLES	Come back, or I put a hole in him.
F	WELLES	You might make it to your gun, but not before I shoot Machine. And if I have to shoot him because of you, and I don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you.
F	WELLES	Take off the mask.
F	WELLES	Take it off!
M	MACHINE	You got one bullet.
M	MACHINE	The only choice you have now, is which one of us kills you.
M	MACHINE	Get the gun!
F	AMY	Hello?
M	WELLES (V.O.)	Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
F	AMY	Tom? Where have you been... ?
F	WELLES	Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there... What's wrong? Are you alright?
F	WELLES	I'm okay. Please, honey, I can't explain. Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out. I'm on my way. I'll be back at the house in three hours. Call me from the hotel when you get there ... What's going on?
F	WELLES	Just do it, Amy, please, go.
F	WELLES	Honey... ?
M	MACHINE (V.O.)	Not quite.
M	MACHINE (V.O.)	Nothing like getting home after a rough day. Home sweet home.
M	MACHINE (V.O.)	Walk away. Pack your bags, put the wife and kid in the car and find a place to hide. If you're lucky, you'll never see me again.
F	WELLES	I don't know if I can do that. I know who you are. I know where you live. I know everything I need to know to find you. Who am I?
F	AMY	What happened to you?
F	WELLES	I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
F	AMY	What's going on, Tom? What happened?
F	WELLES	I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...
F	AMY	Tom...
F	WELLES	It has to be this way for now. It won't be long.
F	AMY	Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
F	WELLES	I don't know. I'm sorry...
F	AMY	You're sorry? What was I supposed to think?
F	AMY	You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this.
F	WELLES	I wanted to call. I couldn't.
F	AMY	You couldn't?
F	WELLES	You don't understand...
F	AMY	No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
F	WELLES	I was in hell. If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
F	AMY	You should have.
F	WELLES	Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
F	AMY	Look where we are. Look at yourself. You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
F	WELLES	I don't know what to say
F	AMY	You're killing me...
F	WELLES	Don't...
F	AMY	What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
F	WELLES	Amy...
F	WELLES	Forgive me.
F	WELLES	We have to stay here a few days. I'll get more clothing from the house if I can. I'm sorry. We're going to be okay.
F	AMY	Who are you calling?
F	WELLES	Mrs. Christian.
F	AMY	What?
F	WELLES	She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
F	AMY	Tom... she's dead.
F	AMY	She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper...
F	WELLES	I just talked to her.
F	AMY	How could you not know?
F	AMY	Promise you'll stay.
F	WELLES	Promise you won't go back there, wherever you were. Whatever it was, forget it.
F	AMY	Promise me.
F	WELLES	I promise.
F	WELLES	Hello, Eddie.
F	WELLES	Put your hands on your head.
F	WELLES	Put your hands behind your head, lock your finger together, get down on your knees.
F	WELLES	I owe you a few.
F	WELLES	Don't go anywhere.
M	EDDIE	I'm gonna kill you.
F	WELLES	Don't bore me with that bullshit.
M	EDDIE	How'd you find me here?
F	WELLES	Don't ask questions.
M	EDDIE	Fuck you!
F	WELLES	Starting to recognize a pattern?
M	EDDIE	What do you want?
F	WELLES	Who is Machine?
M	EDDIE	I don't know...
F	WELLES	I want his name.
M	EDDIE	I told you, I don't know.
F	WELLES	I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
M	EDDIE	What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for? He was Dino's boy, not mine. He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on. Nobody knows.
F	WELLES	Okay, we'll come back to that. So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it. It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
M	EDDIE	Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
F	WELLES	Told him you could get him a snuff film.
M	EDDIE	Yeah.
F	WELLES	How much did he pay you?
M	EDDIE	Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
F	WELLES	That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
M	EDDIE	It was a lot of fucking money.
F	WELLES	So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine. And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models. And she never walked out.
M	EDDIE	Something like that.
F	WELLES	What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
M	EDDIE	What the fuck do you want from me?
F	WELLES	I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her!
M	EDDIE	Fuck you then, you want to know? I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star. I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey. When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it. That's what happened. She's dead. She's been dead a long fucking time. Nobody fucking cares!
M	EDDIE	You wanted to know, now you know.
M	EDDIE	That's right, motherfucker, cut me loose. Be a man.
F	WELLES	Show me!
F	WELLES	Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
M	EDDIE	Why?
F	WELLES	Because we're going there.
M	EDDIE	What are we doing here?
F	WELLES	That night... you didn't have to be in the room, but you were. Why? Why did you watch?
M	EDDIE	I don't know. I felt like it. I never saw anyone get done before.
F	WELLES	You enjoy it?
M	EDDIE	Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was doing for money.
F	WELLES	Tell me what happened.
M	EDDIE	What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
F	WELLES	Nobody saw you bring her in?
M	EDDIE	There wasn't nobody around. This place was a shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries. Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
F	WELLES	What did you do with her body?
M	EDDIE	Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
F	WELLES	Show me.
M	EDDIE	What are you thinking you're gonna do... ?
F	WELLES	Keep moving.
M	EDDIE	Where do you think you're taking this, huh? Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world? How you gonna do that... ?
M	EDDIE	You can't go to the cops. All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
F	WELLES	Stop talking.
M	EDDIE	You got absolute zero.
F	WELLES	Show me where you buried her.
M	EDDIE	I don't know... ... out there somewhere.
F	WELLES	Where? Show me where.
M	EDDIE	I fucking don't know. What do you think... we weren't burying treasure. We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it. We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
M	EDDIE	You'll never find her. Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing. Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all. Without the film, it never happened. Don't you get it? It's over. You can't do anything.
F	WELLES	I can kill you. I can leave you out here, just like you left her.
M	EDDIE	Do it.
F	WELLES	Don't think I won't.
M	EDDIE	Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
F	WELLES	Easy enough for you.
M	EDDIE	I never killed anyone.
F	WELLES	That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it." Almost makes you worse.
M	EDDIE	What do you want? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
M	EDDIE	Where you going? You're the one with the gun. Aren't I defenseless enough? Come on...
M	EDDIE	Go ahead and kill me. Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name? Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it. Fucking do it!
M	EDDIE	You pussy.
M	EDDIE	Fucking pussy!
M	MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)	Hello... ?
F	WELLES	Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
M	MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)	I remember. You just left...
F	WELLES	I have to tell you something. It won't be easy for you to hear. It's about your daughter... Mary Anne... When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware. If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
M	MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)	What are you talking about... ?
F	WELLES	She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
M	MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)	What... ?
F	WELLES	Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
M	MRS MATHEWS	Who is this... ?
F	WELLES	Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
M	MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)	Who are you?
F	WELLES	They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
M	MRS MATHEWS	No...
F	WELLES	He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes... No... no... no...
F	WELLES	They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
F	WELLES	They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry. It happened a month after she ran away. She's been dead all this time...
F	WELLES	I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there wasn't anything anyone could do...
M	AGENT	There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed through to Kennedy. Gate 32B.
M	AGENT	Mr. Welles?
M	AGENT	Gate 32B.
F	WELLES	Hello, can you connect me with the duty nurse? Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson down here in the Thirteenth Precinct. I've got a helluva problem I was hoping you could give me a hand with. We had a stabbing incident a couple of days ago, and it looks like the supposed victim gave us a false name and address. Can you tell me if you had an adult male with an abdominal wound in you ER in the last forty-eight hours? You'd remember this guy; a body- builder, real big guy, five foot eleven, with acne all over his chest and back... Alright, thanks for your help.
F	WELLES	... guy sticks out like a sore thumb. Five foot ten or eleven, body-builder, bad acne... Okay, thanks anyway.
M	WELLES (O.S.)	... abdominal wound. You'd know him if you saw him...
F	WELLES	He's a body-builder, stands just under six feet...
F	WELLES	That's right... covered in acne. That's him, that's the guy. Listen, we, uh... we think he filed a bogus report on this stabbing, gave us a false name and address... Yes, I'll hold.
F	WELLES	Yes... yes. Christopher Higgins. Thirty- fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street. Where? Astoria, Queens. Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of
F	WELLES	Hello?! Amy?
F	AMY	Tom?!
F	AMY	How much forgiveness do you think I have in me?
F	WELLES	I can't talk about it yet... not yet.
F	WELLES	Why... why... ?
F	AMY	Tom... ?
F	WELLES	I have to tell you... I have to tell you what happened. I have to tell you everything, but we can't tell anyone else. No one else can ever know.
F	WELLES	You're all I've got. You're all I've ever had. You're the only one who can save me.
M	the end
