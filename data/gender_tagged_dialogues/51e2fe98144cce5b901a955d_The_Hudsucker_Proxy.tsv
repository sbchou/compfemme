M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	The's right... New York. It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo' minutes it is. Come midnight it's gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother feelin'. The New Year. The future... ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to start one mo' trip 'round the sun, an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round be a little mo' giddy, a little mo' gay... Yep...
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...All over town champagne corks is a-poppin'.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...Over in the Waldorf the big shots is dancin' to the strains of Guy Lombardo... Down in Times Square the little folks is a-watchin' and a- waitin' fo' that big ball to drop...
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...They all tryin' to catch holt a one moment of time...
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...to be able to say -- 'Right now! This is it! I got it!' 'Course by then it'll be past. But they all happy, evvybody havin' a good time.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...Well, almost evvybody. They's a few lost souls floatin' 'round out there...
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...This one's Norville Barnes.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...Let's move in for a closer look.
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...That office he jes stepped out of is the office of the president of Hudsucker Industries. It's his office...
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...How'd he get so high? An' why is he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna do it -- is Norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk?
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...Well the future, that's something you can't never tell about...
M	NARRATOR (V.O.)	...But the past... That's another story...
M	EXECUTIVE	-- So in the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening. We're up 18 percent over last year's third quarter gross and, needless to say, that's a new record...
M	EXECUTIVE	...The competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack. Market share in most divisions is increasing and we've opened seven new regional offices...
M	EXECUTIVE	...Our international division has also shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and we're looking at some exciting things in R&D... Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me about sub-franchising; we're making so much money in sub-franchising it isn't even funny. Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries. Low pay. Long Hours. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue.
M	EXECUTIVE (O.S.)	...Our owned-and-operateds are performing far above expectations both here and abroad, and the Federal Tax Act of 1958 is giving us a swell writeoff on our plant and heavies...
M	EXECUTIVE	...The news in the money market isn't good -- it's excellent... ...Our nominees and assigns continue to multiply and expand extending our influence regionally, nationally and globally. So, third quarter and year- to-date, we've set a new record for sales...
M	EXECUTIVE (O.S.)	...new record in gross...
M	EXECUTIVE (O.S.)	...new record in pre-tax earnings... ...new record in after-tax profit...
M	EXECUTIVE (O.S.)	...and our stock has split twice this year...
M	EXECUTIVE (O.S.)	...In short...
M	EXECUTIVE	...we're loaded.
M	HUDSUCKER	Ahem...
M	EXECUTIVE	...Mr. Hudsucker? Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries. Low pay. Long Hours. NO EXPERIENCED NECESSARY. Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue.
M	HUDSUCKER	Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh...
M	HUDSUCKER	...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...
F	MUSSBURGER	Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.
M	AN EXECUTIVE	He could've opened the window.
M	ELDERLY EXECUTIVE	Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way.
M	ADDISON	My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
F	MUSSBURGER	What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
M	ADDISON	He didn't look unhappy!
M	EXECUTIVE	Yeah, well, he didn't look rich.
M	ELDERY EXECUTIVE	Waring Hudsucker was never an easy man to figure out. He built this company with his bare hands. Every step he took was a step up. Except of course this last one.
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but when the president, chairman of the board and holder of eighty-seven percent of the company's stock drops forty-four floors --
M	PRECISE EXECUTIVE	Forty-five --
M	ELDERY EXECUTIVE	Counting the mezzanine --
F	MUSSBURGER	-- Then the company has a problem. Stillson, what exactly is the disposition of Waring's stock?
M	STILLSON	Well, as you know, Hud left no will and had no family. The company bylaws are quite clear in that event. His entire portfolio will be converted to common stock and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year following his demise.
F	MUSSBURGER	Meaning?
M	STILLSON	Meaning simply that Waring's stock, and control of the company, will be available to the public on January first.
F	MUSSBURGER	You mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?
M	STILLSON	The company bylaws are quite clear.
M	ADDISON	My God! You're animals! How can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt forty-five floors --
M	PRECISE EXECUTIVE	Forty-four --
M	ELDERLY EXECUTIVE	-- Not counting the mezzanine.
F	MUSSBURGER	Quit showboating, Addison, the man is gone. The question now is whether we're going to let John Q. Public waltz in and buy 87 percent of our company.
M	PIPE-SMOKING EXECUTIVE	What're you suggesting, Sidney? Certainly we can't afford to buy a controlling interest.
F	MUSSBURGER	Not while the stock is this strong. How long before Hud's paper hits the market?
M	STILLSON	January first.
M	AN EXECUTIVE	Thirty days.
M	ANOTHER EXECUTIVE	Four weeks.
M	ADDISON	A month at the most.
F	MUSSBURGER	One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic.
M	AN EXECUTIVE	We play up the fact that Hud is dead.
M	ALL	Long live the Hud!!
M	ANOTHER EXECUTIVE	We depress the stock --
M	YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE	-- to the point where we can buy fifty-percent.
M	PRECISE EXECUTIVE	Fifty-one.
M	ELDERLY EXECUTIVE	Not counting the mezzanine.
M	CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE	It could work.
M	OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE	It should work.
M	PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE	It would work.
F	MUSSBURGER	It's working already. Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue. All we need now is a new president who will inspire real panic in our stockholders.
M	ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE	Yeah, a puppet!
M	ANOTHER EXECUTIVE	A proxy!
M	YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE	A pawn!
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really push around.
M	AGENT	You punch in at 8:30 every morning except you punch in at 7:30 following a business holiday unless it's a Monday and then you punch in at eight o'clock! You punch in at 7:45 whenever we work extended day and you punch out at the regular time unless you've worked through lunch!

M	NORVILLE	...Bring it down to fif(?)... fifteen... sign the voucher, uh, waiver... cover for Mr. Anatole... he's a swell guy... Morgatross... He was on, uh...
M	NORVILLE	Say, what do you do when the envelope is too big for the slot?
M	ANCIENT SORTER	Well... if ya fold 'em, they fire ya...
M	ANCIENT SORTER	...I usually throw 'em out.
M	NORVILLE	Just got hired today!
M	ANCIENT SORTER	Terrific.
M	NORVILLE	Ya know, entry level!
M	ANCIENT SORTER	Tell me about it.
M	NORVILLE	I got big ideas, though!
M	ANCIENT SORTER	I'm sure you do.
M	NORVILLE	For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
M	NORVILLE	...you look like you can keep a secret...
M	NORVILLE	...Something I developed myself. Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs.
M	NORVILLE	...You know, for kids!
M	ANCIENT SORTER	Terrific.
M	NORVILLE	So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
M	ANCIENT SORTER	Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
M	NORVILLE	How long've you been down here?
M	ANCIENT SORTER	Forty-eight years...
M	ANCIENT SORTER	...Next year they move me up to parcels...
M	ANCIENT SORTER	...If I'm lucky.
M	PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)	Attention Hudsucker employees. We regretfully announce that at 12:01 this afternoon, Hudsucker time, Waring Hudsucker, Founder, President, and Chairman of the Board of Hudsucker Industries, merged with the infinite. To mark this occasion of corporate loss, we ask that all employees observe a moment of silent contemplation.
M	PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)	...Thank you for your kind attention. This moment has been duly-noted on your time cards and will be deducted from your pay. That is all.
M	PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)	'Blue letter! Blue letter!'
M	VARIOUS VOICES	Blue letter...! It's a blue letter...! They're bringing down a blue letter!
M	MAN	Blue letter!!
M	ANCIENT SORTER	Jumpin' Jehosephat, a blue letter!
M	ANCIENT SORTER	It's a blue letter... top, top level... confidential communication between the brass... usually bad news... they hate blue letters upstairs... Hate 'em!
M	HUTCHINSON	You!
M	HUTCHINSON	...Yeah, you! Barnes!
M	HUTCHINSON	...You don't look busy! Think you can handle a blue letter? ...This letter was sent down this morning by the big guy himself! 'At's right, Waring Hudsucker! It's addressed to Sid Mussburger! Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a blue letter! That means you put it right in Mussburger's hand. No secretaries! No receptionists! No colleagues! No excuses!
M	HUTCHINSON	Mussburger!!
M	BUZZ	Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got the fuzz...
M	BUZZ	...I make the elevator do what she duzz!
M	BUZZ	...Hang it up to dry.
M	BUZZ	...What's your pleasure, buddy?
M	NORVILLE	Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
M	BUZZ	Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down? I --
M	BUZZ	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
M	BUZZ	Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven.
M	MR. LEVIN	Thirty-six.
M	BUZZ	Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen, step to the rear; here comes gargantuan Mr. Grier.
M	FAT MAN	Buzz.
M	BUZZ	Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
M	NORVILLE	Well, I --
M	BUZZ	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
M	BUZZ	...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun, it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a blue letter?!
M	BUZZ	...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express to the top floor!
M	BUZZ	Good luck, buddy!
M	BUZZ	-- You'll need it!
M	NORVILLE	...Mr. Mussburger's office?
M	RECEPTIONIST	Do you have an appointment?
M	NORVILLE	Uhh, no, I --
M	RECEPTIONIST	Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm?
M	NORVILLE	No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in the --
M	RECEPTIONIST	We don't seem to be in the boooook.
M	NORVILLE	No, ma'am, ya see I don't have an --
M	RECEPTIONIST	If we had an appointment we'd be in the booook.
M	NORVILLE	I know but ya see I have this -- here it is, this letter --
F	MUSSBURGER	-- Sure sure, Parkinson's stupid but he's ambitious, too hard to control...
F	MUSSBURGER	...No! Not McClanahan; sure he bungled the Teleyard merger, but that means he's got something to prove...
F	MUSSBURGER	...Who let you in?
M	NORVILLE	I --
F	MUSSBURGER	Atwater? Tremendous. Except I fired him last week --
M	VOICE (V.O.)	Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs.
F	MUSSBURGER	Tell him I'll be right there... Well, what is it?
M	NORVILLE	I --
F	MUSSBURGER	You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him. ...Make it fast, make it fast.
M	NORVILLE	You --
M	VOICE (V.O.)	Mr. Bumstead is getting very --
F	MUSSBURGER	I'll be right there. Give him a magazine. ...What're you, a mute?
F	MUSSBURGER	...Yeah, how's the stock doing? ...Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough. ...Look, chump, either you find me a grade A ding-dong or you can tender your key to the executive washroom. And that goes double for you. Ear-clay? Ood-gay! This better be good. I'm in a bad mood.
M	NORVILLE	Well, sir. I've got something for you from the mailroom, but first if I could just take a minute or so from your very busy time...
M	NORVILLE	...to show you a, uh...
M	NORVILLE	...a little something I've been working on for the last two or three years...
M	NORVILLE	...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
F	MUSSBURGER	Wait a minute!
F	MUSSBURGER	Hmmm...
F	MUSSBURGER	Umm-hmm...
F	MUSSBURGER	Siddown.
F	MUSSBURGER	...Go ahead. Try it on.
F	MUSSBURGER	...Put your feet up.
F	MUSSBURGER	...Go ahead.
F	MUSSBURGER	Hmmmm... Let's get to know one another, shall we?
F	MUSSBURGER	...Let's chat! ...Man to man!
F	MUSSBURGER	...You weren't blessed with much...
F	MUSSBURGER	...education, were you?
M	NORVILLE	Well, I'm a college graduate --
F	MUSSBURGER	All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
M	NORVILLE	Well, I made the dean's list.
F	MUSSBURGER	Hmmm.
M	NORVILLE	At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or... ...'schmoe'?
F	MUSSBURGER	...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
M	NORVILLE	No, sir.
F	MUSSBURGER	Not even behind your back?
M	NORVILLE	Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
F	MUSSBURGER	You're fired.
M	NORVILLE	But, sir! --
F	MUSSBURGER	Get your feet off that desk.
M	NORVILLE	But --
F	MUSSBURGER	Get out of my sight.
F	MUSSBURGER	My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
M	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
F	MUSSBURGER	You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
M	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
F	MUSSBURGER	I'll take care of it. Just get out!
F	MUSSBURGER	Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
M	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
F	MUSSBURGER	Now out of here! Out!
F	MUSSBURGER	Not that way! Through the door!
M	NORVILLE	But, sir!
F	MUSSBURGER	Right away, buster! Out of my office!
F	MUSSBURGER	Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
M	NORVILLE	Sir, my leg is on fire!
F	MUSSBURGER	Get out of this office, you dithering nincompoop!
M	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
F	MUSSBURGER	My God! The Bumstead contracts!
M	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
F	MUSSBURGER	Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!
M	BUMSTEAD	No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger! I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he jump out a window too?!
M	NORVILLE	Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. I gotcha by your pants!
M	LUIGI	Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make 'em strong, and they look-a real sharp.
F	MUSSBURGER	No! Single stitch is fine.
M	LUIGI	But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, the dooble stitch she last-a forever --
F	MUSSBURGER	Why on earth would I need a double stitch? To pad your bill? Single stitch is fine!
F	MUSSBURGER	Damn!
M	LUIGI	What the heck. Meester Moosaburger such a nice-a guy, I give him dooble steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong- a steech-a, you bet!
F	MUSSBURGER	Hmmm...
M	EDITOR	'The Einstein of Enterprise.' 'The Edison of Industry.' 'The Billion- Dollar Cranium'... 'Idea Man'! And not one of you mugs has given me a story on him!!
M	EDITOR	Facts, figures, charts! They never sold a newspaper! I read this morning's edition of the Argus and let me tell you something: I'd wrap a fish in it! I'd use it as kindling! Hell, I'd even train my poodle with it if he wasn't a French poodle and more partial to the pages of Paree Soir! But I sure wouldn't shell out a hard-earned nickel to read the dadblamed thing!
M	REPORTER	Come on, chief, give us a break.
M	EDITOR	Suuuure, Tibbs, take a break! Go to Florida! Lie in the sun! Wait for a coconut to drop, file a story on it -- it'll be more of a grabber than your piece on the commie grain surplus! The human angle! That's what sells papers! We need a front page with heart and the whole idea of the 'Idea Man' idea can put it there!
M	REPORTER #2	Chief, if we had more access --
M	EDITOR	Yeah, and if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I don't want excuses, I want results!
M	EDITOR	I wanna know what makes the Idea Man tick! Where is he from? Where is he going? I wanna know everything about this guy! Has he got a girl? Has he got parents?
M	REPORTER #3	Everybody has parents.
M	EDITOR	All right, how many? How 'bout it, Parkinson, you've been awful quiet over there.
M	PARKINSON	Uhhh...
M	REPORTER NEXT TO HIM	Still waters run deep, chief.
M	EDITOR	The only thing that runs deep with Parkinson is the holes in his ears. Yes, the Idea Man! What're his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations? Does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day? How tall is he and what's his shoe size? Where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast? Does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he put jam on his toast, and if not why not and since when?
M	EDITOR	...Well?!!
M	EDITOR	...Ahh, you're useless. Yes, Idea Man! Creator! Innovator! Cerebrator! Tycoon!--
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	Fake.
M	EDITOR	Huhh!!
F	AMY	I tell ya the guy's a phony.
M	EDITOR	Phony, huh?
F	AMY	As a three-dollar bill.
M	EDITOR	Sez who?
F	AMY	Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
M	REPORTER	Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer.
M	OTHER REPORTER	Again? You're on.
F	AMY	...And just take a look at the mug on this guy -- the jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead, the idiotic grin. Why he has a face only a mother could love --
F	AMY	...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
M	EDITOR	Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
F	AMY	I filed it yesterday.
M	EDITOR	Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
M	REPORTERS	All right, chief... We'll do our best, chief... I'll give it a shot, chief...
F	AMY	Al, he's the bunk.
F	AMY	I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!
M	BUZZ	Say, buddy! Where'd ya get the new duds?
M	BUZZ	...and say, buddy! How'd old bucketbutt like his blue letter? Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut? Did he die? Did he -- Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger, sir...
M	BUZZ	...How're you this fine morning, sir?
M	NORVILLE	That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
F	MUSSBURGER	Lobby. We haven't got all day.
M	BUZZ	Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.
F	MUSSBURGER	Well I'm starved. I understand it'll be quite an affair this afternoon, and the executive roast tom turkey at the Bohemian Grove redefines the word superb.
M	BUZZ	My pleasure, sir.
M	NORVILLE	Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure...
M	BUZZ	It's been a pleasure serving you, Mr. Mussburger.
M	BUZZ	...and it's been a pleasure serving you too, uh... buddy.
M	NORVILLE	Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't we be a little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last few days? I mean, you're the expert, but at the Muncie College of Business Administration they told us --
F	MUSSBURGER	Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
M	NORVILLE	Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
M	NORVILLE	...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
F	MUSSBURGER	I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
M	NORVILLE	Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
F	MUSSBURGER	Damnit, where's my car!
M	NORVILLE	-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
F	MUSSBURGER	Finally.
M	NORVILLE	-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, tell whoever you want...
F	MUSSBURGER	...And I'd like to hear more about it at some point, too.
M	NORVILLE	But, Sid, I thought you and I were...
M	DOORMAN	Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk clear here?
M	NORVILLE	But I'm the president of this -- aww, forget it.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	I got gas, Bennie.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	Yeah, tell me about it.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	Ya get the special? Fah from it...
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	...Enter the dame.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	There's one in every story.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	She's looking for her mark. She finds him.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	She sits down.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	...and awduhs a light lunch. She looks in her purse...
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	...No money.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	The mark notices.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	...He's not noticing, Benny.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	Maybe he's wise.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	He don't look wise.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	Yellowstone.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	Old Faithful.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	Hello, Niagara.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	He notices.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	He's concerned. She explains her perdicament, and...
M	VETERAN #1 & #2 (O.S.)	...entuh the light lunch.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	She's got other problems, of course... ...Her mother needs an operation...
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	...adenoids.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	No, Bennie: Lumbago.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	She's losing him, Bennie.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	Maybe he's wise.
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	He don't look wise. How does she pull this out?
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	She isn't!
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	She is!
M	VETERAN #1 (O.S.)	She's good, Bennie.
M	VETERAN #2 (O.S.)	She's damn good, Lou.
M	WAITRESS	Can I get you boys anything else?
M	VETERAN #1	Bromo.
M	VETERAN #2	...Bromo.
F	AMY	I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
M	NORVILLE	Not at all. You're light as a feather.
F	AMY	The couch, please.
M	NORVILLE	Just a minute.
F	AMY	I don't know what came over me. I suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without; the enzymes kicking in after so long, or whatever. But then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry...
M	NORVILLE	Hungry, anyway.
F	AMY	I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
F	AMY	...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless -- though not for want of trying, that I'm friendless, with no one to -- thank you -- take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the moment that you did --
F	AMY	Norville, I didn't know you were president here!
M	NORVILLE	Oh, it's nothing really. Just determination and hard work...
M	NORVILLE	...Of course, when I started in the mailroom last Tuesday I thought it might take more time --
M	BUZZ	Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you asked f --
M	NORVILLE	Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on the desk.
M	BUZZ	Happy days, buddy...
M	BUZZ	...and I'll tell your secretary you're not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!!
F	AMY	What a horrible little person.
M	NORVILLE	Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
F	AMY	At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
F	AMY	A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
M	NORVILLE	I myself --
F	AMY	Only to have that belief, that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place --
M	NORVILLE	Cigarette?
F	AMY	No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
F	AMY	-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
M	NORVILLE	Mind if I join you?
F	AMY	Be my guest. A little town you've probably --
M	NORVILLE	He waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his feet.
M	NORVILLE	Excuse me -- I -- executive washroom...
F	AMY	Are you all right?...
F	AMY	...Is it your lunch? The chicken a la king? No, I --
F	AMY	Is the a la king repeating on you?
M	NORVILLE (O.S.)	...I'm fine, I... You were saying?
F	AMY	Values... watchwords... uh, tender years... -- A little town you've probably never heard of...
F	AMY	...Muncie, Indiana.
M	NORVILLE	You're from Muncie?!
F	AMY	Why yes, do you know it?
M	NORVILLE	'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!'
M	NORVILLE	...Goooooooo Eagles!
M	NORVILLE	...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
F	AMY	Oh, no, really, I --
M	NORVILLE	Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
M	NORVILLE	...Mail room.
M	NORVILLE	...This'll only take a moment. Yeah?
M	NORVILLE	Barnes -- Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
M	NORVILLE	...Well, I'm not sure where I --
M	INTERCOM (V.O.)	I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
M	NORVILLE	But look, I'm president of the company now and I -- I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
M	NORVILLE	Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
F	AMY	Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
M	NORVILLE	-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
F	AMY	Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
M	NORVILLE	Please! Norville!
M	NORVILLE	...It's my pleasure!
M	NORVILLE	...Gooooooo Eagles!
F	AMY	Gooooooooo Eagles!
M	SMITTY	...Once 'The Munce'... Holy...
F	AMY	And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
M	SMITTY	Adenoids?
F	AMY	Lumbago.
M	SMITTY	That gag's got whiskers on it!
F	AMY	I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
M	SMITTY	Yeah.
M	ANCIENT PUZZLER	Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word for an affliction of the hypothalmus?
F	AMY	-- And it's a cinch -- Goiter -- it's a cinch this guy isn't in on it. How much time to make the Late Final?
M	SMITTY	Chief.
F	AMY	Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted to apologize to...
M	SMITTY	About seven minutes.
F	AMY	Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
F	AMY	-- as in a five-letter word for imbecile --
F	AMY	-- as pure a specimen as I've ever run across... Am I sure he's a nitwit? Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't make me an expert then my name isn't Amy Archer and I've never won the Pulitzer Prize...
F	AMY	...In 1957... My series on the reunited triplets -- come on down here, hammerhead, and I'll show it to ya...
M	ANCIENT PUZZLER	Amy, what's a three-letter word for a flightless bird?
F	AMY	Not now, Morris, I'm busy -- That's right, I said hammerhead, as in a ten-letter word for a smug bullying self-important newspaperman --
F	AMY	-- Gnu --
F	AMY	-- who couldn't find --
F	AMY	-- That's G-N-U --
F	AMY	-- couldn't find the Empire State Building with a compass, a road map and a native guide.
F	AMY	-- or emu.
F	AMY	...And that's just the potatoes, Smitty, here comes the gravy: The chump really likes me. A Muncie girl!
M	SMITTY	Better off falling for a rattlesnake.
F	AMY	I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
M	SMITTY	He didn't offer you money.
F	AMY	A sawbuck!
M	SMITTY	Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
F	AMY	On Norville Barnes!
F	AMY	...Copy!
M	NORVILLE	Miss Smith, can you come in please to take a letter...
M	NORVILLE	...of all the cockamamie...
M	NORVILLE	...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
F	AMY	Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
M	NORVILLE	The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
F	AMY	-- or lack thereof?
M	NORVILLE	-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
F	AMY	Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
M	NORVILLE	...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
F	AMY	I'm sure I --
M	NORVILLE	Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
F	AMY	Well, I --
M	NORVILLE	Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
M	NORVILLE	...I designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put Hudsucker right back on top.
M	NORVILLE	...You know! For kids!
F	AMY	...Why don't I just type this up...
M	NORVILLE	Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
F	AMY	Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
M	NORVILLE	Well, she probably had a deadline...
F	AMY	Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
M	NORVILLE	Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
M	NORVILLE	...She's probably just a little confused.
F	AMY	Confused?
M	NORVILLE	Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
F	AMY	I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
M	NORVILLE	Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
F	AMY	Oh, is that it!
M	NORVILLE	Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
F	AMY	Smitty.
M	NORVILLE	Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
F	AMY	Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
M	NORVILLE	I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
M	NORVILLE	...How about Oklahoma?
F	AMY	Norville Barnes, you don't know a thing about that woman! You don't know who she really is! And only a numbskull thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about!
M	NORVILLE	Say, what gives?
F	MUSSBURGER	Memo. From the desk of Sidney J. Mussburger. Executive order number 530 slash A49. To: Director of the Jacksonville Facility. Copies to: Legal Affairs, Business Affairs, Central Files. Re: Movement of Raw Materials from the Huron Facility. Due to unfavorable news in the slag markets, Jacksonville inventory must be reduced by 15 percent with overflow diverted to the Waukegan Stamping Facility. Memo. From the desk of Sidney J. Mussburger. Executive order number 530 slash A50. To: Director of --
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Watchoo doin' down they, Miss Archuh?
F	AMY	Huh?!
F	AMY	Who are you? How did you know who I am?
M	MOSES (BLACK MAN)	Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
F	AMY	But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
M	MOSES	Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
F	AMY	Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
M	MOSES	I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
F	AMY	So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
M	MOSES	Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
F	AMY	That smart?!
M	MOSES	But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
F	AMY	Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
M	MOSES	'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
M	MOSES	...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, he's a caution. Wal, some folks is square, an' some is hip --
M	MOSES	...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
F	AMY	Well, maybe I --
M	MOSES	An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
F	AMY	It's hardly the same --
M	MOSES	Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
F	AMY	Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
M	MOSES	I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
F	AMY	I'm happy enough.
M	MOSES	Okay, Miss Archuh. ...I got gears to see to.
F	AMY	I'm plenty happy! ...Hello?
M	MOSES	Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
M	CHIEF	I can't print this!
F	AMY	Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
M	CHIEF	It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
M	SMITTY	Ol' satchel-butt...
F	AMY	I know they're gonna buy that stock --
M	CHIEF	You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
F	AMY	I don't know...
M	SMITTY	Amy's hunches are usually pretty good, Chief.
M	CHIEF	You don't accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz! The readers of the Manhattan Argus aren't interested in sensationalism, gossip and unsupported speculation. Facts, figures -- those are the tools of the newspaper trade! Why it's almost as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull -- like you've gone all soft on him!
M	SMITTY	Come on, Chief, that's a low blow. Archer's not gonna go goey for a corn-fed idiot.
M	CHIEF	All right, I was out of line. But you're out of line with this stock swindle story. Gimme some more of that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff --
F	AMY	Muncie.
M	CHIEF	Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
F	AMY	I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
M	CHIEF	Watch it, Archer --
F	AMY	It's about a dimwitted editor who --
M	SMITTY	Easy, Amy...
M	SMITTY	...Let's grab a highball and calm down.
F	AMY	Back off -- smoocher!
M	SMITTY	Say, what gives?
F	MRS. MUSSBURGER	-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
M	NORVILLE	That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
F	MRS. MUSSBURGER	Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
F	MRS. MUSSBURGER	I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
M	NORVILLE	I haven't had --
F	MRS. MUSSBURGER	Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure. I'm going to borrow Norville for a while, if you don't mind, dear.
F	MRS. MUSSBURGER	Well, frankly, I...
M	NORVILLE	You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
F	MUSSBURGER	So they tell me. Norville, let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here. Try not to talk too much; some of our biggest stockholders are, uh -- scratch that: Say whatever you want.
F	MUSSBURGER	Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce Mr. Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker Industries largest and most loyal stockholders.
M	CARDOZO (BUSINESSMAN)	Dammit boy, what's this I hear about you bein' an embecile? What the hell is ailin' ya?! A week ago my stock was worth twice what it is now! I'm considering dumping the whole shootin' match, unless I see some vast improvement! Dammit, boy, It's a range war! Either you pull our wagons into a circle or I'm pullin' out of the wagon train!
M	NORVILLE	No need for concern, sir; it's only natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover --
M	CARDOZO	So I'm yella, am I?!!
M	CARDOZO	...We'll see who's yella!!
M	MRS. CARDOZO	Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein' sech an ole grizzly.
M	CARDOZO	Aww, I wasn't gonna hurt the boy, Lorelei...
M	NORVILLE	I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I showed him the long view we might --
F	MUSSBURGER	Norville, this is Thorstensen Finlandsen, who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled investors.
M	NORVILLE	Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y -- uh, pleased to make your --
M	NORVILLE	Thank you, sir...
M	NORVILLE	...I understand your concern about the down-ward, you know, but I think you'll find under our strong new leadership...
M	NORVILLE (O.S.)	We anticipate, in short order, an upward...
M	MRS. FINDLANDSEN	Ahhh!
M	EMCEE	Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the Hudsucker board. I give you the king of swing, the rajah of romance, the incredible, the unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta!
M	EXECUTIVE #1	How's it going, Mr. Mussburger?
F	MUSSBURGER	Bad.
M	EXECUTIVE #2	Good.
F	MUSSBURGER	But not bad enough. Too bad.
F	MUSSBURGER	It could be better, it could be worse.
M	ALL THREE EXECUTIVES	Hmmmmmm.
F	MUSSBURGER	The stock's got to drop another five points if we expect to get controlling interest. Norville tells me he's got some hot idea. Can't be good.
M	EXECUTIVE #1	Then it can't be bad! Couldn't be better if it couldn't be worse.
M	ALL	Hmmmmmm.
F	AMY	...Norville?
F	AMY	...What happened?
M	NORVILLE	Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
F	AMY	Let me look.
M	NORVILLE	Sid found me the icepack.
F	AMY	Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
M	NORVILLE	Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
F	AMY	...I'm sorry.
M	NORVILLE	Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
F	AMY	Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
M	NORVILLE	I know that, Amy.
F	AMY	...You do?
M	NORVILLE	I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front -- -- not that everyone's buying it.
F	AMY	I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
M	NORVILLE	Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
F	AMY	Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
F	AMY	...Certain people are --
M	NORVILLE	Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
F	AMY	...Huh?
M	NORVILLE	You know, on farm route 17.
F	AMY	Oh yes! In Muncie!
M	NORVILLE	No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
F	AMY	Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
M	NORVILLE	You don't say.
F	AMY	Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
M	NORVILLE	Every year?
F	AMY	Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
F	AMY	...The people look like ants.
M	NORVILLE	Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
F	AMY	What a beautiful thought.
M	NORVILLE	What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
F	AMY	Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
M	NORVILLE	Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
F	AMY	Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
M	NORVILLE	That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
F	AMY	I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
M	NORVILLE	Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
F	AMY	Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
M	NORVILLE	That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
M	NORVILLE	...Tomorrow's my big presentation to the board. I've gotta show Sidney and the guys that I deserve all their confidence!
F	AMY	Oh, Norville --
M	NORVILLE	Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
F	AMY	Sure, Norville, sure...
F	AMY	...Oh, Norville!
M	NORVILLE	-- So we have economy, simplicity, low production cost and the potential for mass appeal, and all that spells out great profitability...
M	NORVILLE (O.S.)	...I had the boys down at R & D throw together this prototype so that our discussion here could have some focus...
M	NORVILLE (O.S.)	...and to give you gentlemen of the Board a first-hand look at just how exciting this gizmo is...
M	NORVILLE	...It's fun, it's healthy, it's good exercise; kids'll just love it, and we put a little sand inside to make the whole experience more pleasant. And the great part is we won't have to charge an arm and a leg!
M	ELDERLY EXECUTIVE	Yeah but... What is it?
M	EXECUTIVE #2	Does it have rules?
M	EXECUTIVE #3	Can more than one play?
M	EXECUTIVE #4	What makes you think it's a game?
M	EXECUTIVE #3	Is it a game?
M	EXECUTIVE #5	Will it break?
M	EXECUTIVE #6	It better break eventually!
M	EXECUTIVE #2	Is there an object? Are you supposed to make it fly off?
M	EXECUTIVE #5	Does it come with batteries?
M	EXECUTIVE #4	Could we charge extra for them?
M	EXECUTIVE #7	Is it safe for toddlers?
M	EXECUTIVE #3	How can you tell when you're done?
M	EXECUTIVE #2	How do you make it stop?
M	EXECUTIVE #1	Is that a girl's model or a boy's?
M	EXECUTIVE #3	Can a parent assemble it??
M	EXECUTIVE #7	What if you get tired before it's done? Is there a larger model for the obese? Can you do it around your neck?
M	ELDERLY EXECUTIVE	And finally... what is it?
M	NORVILLE	You know, for kids! It's... it's ... well, it's...
F	MUSSBURGER	It's brilliant.
F	MUSSBURGER	...It's genius. It's just exactly what Hudsucker needs at this juncture. Sure, sure, a blind man could tell you that there's an enormous demand for this, uh...
F	MUSSBURGER	...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
M	NORVILLE	Well... I'm for it...
M	AD MAN #1 (O.S.)	We'll call it the Flying Donut!
M	AD MAN #2 (O.S.)	The Dancing Dingus!
M	AD MAN #1 (O.S.)	The Jerky Circle!
M	AD MAN #1 (O.S.)	Something short.
M	AD MAN #2 (O.S.)	Sharp.
M	AD MAN #1 (O.S.)	Snappy.
M	AD MAN #2 (O.S.)	With a little jazz.
M	AD MAN #1 (O.S.)	The Shazzammeter!

M	AD MAN #1 (O.S.)	Ya got somethin'?
M	AD MAN #2 (O.S.)	Ya got somethin'?!
M	AD MAN #3 (O.S.)	Fellas! I got somethin'!
F	AMY	...Norville! Rockwell News presents... 'Tidbits of Time!' World news in pictures, we kid you not. ...What began as the brainchild of this Madison Avenue whiz kid is now a craze sweeping the nation. The 'hula hoop,' product of Hudsucker Industries, is a recreational device that some experts predict may eclipse the television as a means of entertainment...
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	...This dancing dingus of delight, this jerky circle of gaiety, is proving to be the toy of choice of most American youngsters. -- Whoa- ho! Did I say youngsters?! Here's mom, taking a break from her household chores...
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	...and even dad is 'swinging' into the act!
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	...and so the congratulations pour in for up-and-comer Norville Barnes, inventor of the hoop -- including one very special call!
M	WOMAN (V.O.)	He's on! He's on the line! ...Hello?
M	CRACKLING VOICE (V.O.)	Hello, Norville. This is the President...
M	NORVILLE (V.O.)	Oh my God, sir! ...I just wanted to congratulate you. I'm very proud of you, Norville... Oh my God, sir! ...Mrs. Eisenhower is very proud of you. The American people are very proud of you.
M	REPORTER #1	Mr. Barnes, how'd ya come up with the idea for the hula hoop?
M	NORVILLE	Well, it was no great idea, really. A thing like this, it takes a whole company to put it together, and I'm just grateful for the opportunity --
M	REPORTER #2	Mr. Barnes, did you have any idea there'd be such a huge response?
M	NORVILLE	Well, frankly, I don't think anybody expected this much hoopla --
M	REPORTER #3	'Hoopla on the hula hoop' -- can we quote you on that, Mr. Barnes?
M	NORVILLE	Well sure, I guess --
M	REPORTER #4	Mr. Barnes, are you thinking of giving yourself a nice fat raise?
M	NORVILLE	Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, guys...
M	NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	What scientific principle explains the mind-bending motion of this whipping wheel of wonder?
M	SCIENTIST (V.O.)	Ze dinkus is kvite zimple, really. It operates on ze same principle zat keeps ze earth spinning 'round ze sun, and zat keeps you from flying off ze earth into ze coldest reaches of outer space vere you vood die like a miserable shvine! Yes, ze principle is ze same, except for ze piece of grrrit zey put in to make ze whole experience more pleasant --
M	REPORTER #1	Mr. Barnes, did the board consider you an 'idea man' when they promoted you from the mail room?
M	NORVILLE	Well, I guess so -- I don't think they promoted me because they thought I was a jerk.
M	REPORTER #2	Mr. Barnes, what's the next big idea for you and Hudsucker Industries?
M	NORVILLE	Jeez, I don't know. An idea like this sweet baby doesn't just come overnight...
M	REPORTER	Mr. Barnes, are you --
M	NORVILLE	-- Although I'll tell you one thing: I certainly didn't expect all this 'hoopla'!
M	NORVILLE	...And you can quote me on that! Yes, it's hula hula everywhere! From the cocktail parties of the Park Avenue smart set...
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	...to sweethearts who want to be married in the 'swing' of things...
M	ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	...To our friend the Negro, in the heart of the dark continent.
M	REPORTER #1	Mr. Barnes, Mr. Barnes, Rumpus magazine has called you the most eligible bachelor of the year, and the society pages have been linking you with high-fashion model Za-Za. Would you care to comment?
M	NORVILLE	There's no truth to the rumors; we're just dear friends...
M	NORVILLE	...Isn't that right, Za-Za?
M	ZA-ZA	Gr-r-r-r-r-r-r-oww!
M	REPORTER #2	Ho-leeee!
M	REPORTER #3	Mr. Barnes, whither Hudsucker? Whither Norville Barnes?
M	REPORTER #4	How do you respond to the charges that you're out of ideas? Has Norville Barnes run dry?
M	NORVILLE	Not at all. Why, just this week I came up with several new sweet ideas. A larger model hula hoop for the portly. A battery option for the lazy and handicapped. A model with more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm earning my keep.
M	REPORTER #5	Speaking of that, Mr. Barnes, do you expect to get a raise?
M	NORVILLE	Well, by anyone's account I've saved Hudsucker Industries; our stock is worth more than it's ever been. So, yes, I expect to be compensated for that.
M	NORVILLE	-- ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
F	MUSSBURGER	Pull yourself together, Addison.
M	ADDISON	Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
F	MUSSBURGER	We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
M	ADDISON	I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
M	ADDISON	Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
M	ADDISON	I'm getting off this merry-go-round!
M	EXECUTIVE	Addison!
M	ANOTHER EXECUTIVE	Myron!
M	ADDISON	Aaaaahhh!
F	MUSSBURGER	Plexiglas. Had it installed last week.
M	EXECUTIVE	...Myron?
F	MUSSBURGER	All right, so the kid caught a wave. So right now he and his dingus are on top. Well, this too shall pass. Myrtle J. Mussburger didn't raise her boy to go knockkneed at the first sign of adversity. I say, we made this kid and we can break him. I say, the higher he climbs, the harder he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a future, and in it I see shame, dishonor, ignominy and disgrace.
M	NORVILLE	Hold it!...
M	NORVILLE	...Nobody move, nobody breathe...
M	NORVILLE	...An idea... is coming...
M	NORVILLE	Deflates. He glares at the tailor.
M	NORVILLE	It's gone now.
M	FEMALE (V.O.)	Miss Amy here to see you.
M	NORVILLE	Is she in the book? --
F	AMY	For Pete's sake, Norville!
M	NORVILLE	Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
F	AMY	Never mind about that...
F	AMY	...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
M	NORVILLE	Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
F	AMY	They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
M	NORVILLE	Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
F	AMY	You mean you know about this?
M	NORVILLE	Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
F	AMY	Your i --
M	NORVILLE	We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
F	AMY	You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
F	AMY	...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
M	NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
F	AMY	Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
M	NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
F	AMY	Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
M	NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
F	AMY	Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
M	NORVILLE	Worked in a watch factory?
M	GOON	Huh-huh-huh!
F	AMY	Shutup! Exactly! Don't you remember how you used to feel about the hoop? You told me you were gonna bring a smile to the hips of everyone in America, regardless of race, creed or color. Finally there'd be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together -- even if it kept 'em apart, spacially -- you know, for kids? Your words, Norville, not mine. I used to love Norville Barnes -- yes, love him! -- when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head, but now your head is too big to be in over!
M	NORVILLE	Now, Amy --
F	AMY	Consider this my resignation --
M	GOON	Hey!!
M	GOON	...Awooooo!
F	AMY	-- Effective immediately!!
F	MUSSBURGER	Hmmm... Thank you, Aloysius. This may be useful.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Buddy... Say, buddy...
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Buddy... Ya busy?
M	NORVILLE	Huh-whuh?
M	BUZZ	Looks like ya nodded off there, buddy! Say, ya got a minute?
M	NORVILLE	Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
M	BUZZ	I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
M	BUZZ	...Ya see, I don't intend to be an elevator boy forever! Take a look at this sweet baby!
M	BUZZ	...Ya get it, buddy? Incredibly convenient, isn't it? Ya see --
M	BUZZ	-- this is how it works, it's these little ridges on the side that give it its whammy! See, ya don't have to drink like this anymore --
M	BUZZ	-- Now you can drink like this --
M	BUZZ	...I call it the Buzz-Sucker, get it, buddy? -- After me! Buzz! Why, people are just dyin' for a product like this, and the great thing is we won't have to charge an arm and a --
M	NORVILLE	Wait a minute!
M	NORVILLE	...Why, this is worthless.
M	BUZZ	Huh?! But, buddy --
M	NORVILLE	This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
M	BUZZ	Yeah, but, buddy --
M	NORVILLE	Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
M	NORVILLE	...say, the hula hoop such a success.
M	BUZZ	But, buddy --
M	NORVILLE	And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
M	BUZZ	But, buddy, you were --
M	NORVILLE	-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
M	BUZZ	Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
M	NORVILLE	An example must be made!
M	BUZZ	Wuddya mean, buddy?
M	NORVILLE	Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
M	BUZZ	Awwww, buddy --
M	NORVILLE	And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
M	BUZZ	Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
M	NORVILLE	Get up!
M	BUZZ	I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
M	NORVILLE	We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
M	BUZZ	I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
M	NORVILLE	Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
M	NORVILLE	Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
F	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
M	NORVILLE	Ya don't say.
F	MUSSBURGER	Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
M	NORVILLE	How's that, Sid?
F	MUSSBURGER	It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
M	NORVILLE	Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
F	MUSSBURGER	Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
F	MUSSBURGER	...Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story. But her newspaper won't play ball... Looks like her story's coming out...
F	MUSSBURGER	...See, kid, the problem the Board'll have... you hired this woman. Kept her on, while she made a chump out of you. Serious error of judgment... I mean, business is war, kid -- ya take no prisoners, ya get no second chances. And a boner like this... I'm afraid when the Board meets, after New Year's, your position... well, it looks like you're finished... stick a fork in ya, you're done... washed up... ...I'm sorry, kid. I understand this dolly who betrayed you, she used to be a friend of yours...
M	MUSSBURGER (O.S.)	...And this elevator dope used to be a friend, too... ...Well, they've got your throat pretty well slit. And when you're dead, ya stay dead. Ya don't believe me, ask Waring Hudsucker... Yeah, looks like curtains. Well, condolences, kid... You can't print that!
M	CHIEF	He grins wolfishly.
M	CHIEF	We are printing it! She's hittin' the streets this evening --
M	SMITTY	-- and she's dynamite!
F	AMY	But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
M	CHIEF	Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
F	AMY	Says who?!
M	SMITTY	You're not the only one with sources, Amy --
M	CHIEF	Smith has a source on the Hud board -- very senior, very hushhush --
F	AMY	Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
M	SMITTY	You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
F	AMY	Muncie!
M	CHIEF	Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' -- You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
M	CHIEF	Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
F	AMY	You want slack, I'll give you slack. You're not putting me out to pasture, Al, I quit! Consider this my resignation --
F	AMY	-- effective immediately!
M	SMITTY	...Soft.

M	NORVILLE	Hey! Where's that martini?!
F	AMY	Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
M	NORVILLE	Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
F	AMY	Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!

F	MUSSBURGER	...The barred-window boys are out looking for him now, and we'll see how Wall Street likes the news that the President of Hudsucker Industries is headed for the booby-hatch. Why, when the doc gets through with him he'll need diapers and a dribble cup...
F	MUSSBURGER	...Let me remind you that our secret post-New Year's party will be held in the office of the President shortly after midnight tonight. Remember, it's strictly stag, so leave the wives at home; we'll be showing some films and, yes, gentlemen, there will be exotic dancers.

M	ANGEL	Love that tune. How ya doin', kid?
M	NORVILLE	Mr... Mr. Hudsucker?
M	HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)	Ta-daaaa!
M	HUDSUCKER	...Wooooo!
M	HUDSUCKER	...How d'ya like this thing? They're all wearin' em upstairs now.
M	HUDSUCKER	...It's a fad.
M	HUDSUCKER	...Anyway. I hear you've been having, uh...
M	HUDSUCKER	...Been having some problems with the board. The more things change, know what Iyayayeeeeee...
M	HUDSUCKER	...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
M	NORVILLE	Norville.
M	HUDSUCKER	Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
M	NORVILLE	Yes sir...
M	HUDSUCKER	Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
M	NORVILLE	Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
M	HUDSUCKER	It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
M	NORVILLE	Oh, geez.
M	HUDSUCKER	Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
M	NORVILLE	Geez, I --
M	HUDSUCKER	Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
M	NORVILLE	Yessir.
M	HUDSUCKER	Well, why don't ya read it.
M	NORVILLE	Sir?
M	HUDSUCKER	Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
M	NORVILLE	Yes sir...
M	NORVILLE	'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I --
M	HUDSUCKER	Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
M	NORVILLE	'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
M	NORVILLE	'...Looking back now, Sid, I see that I allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self. How is it that some manage to preserve themselves where I have failed? Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself -- but I am alone. I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of I...'
M	HUDSUCKER	Skip this part...
M	HUDSUCKER	...Last paragraph, last paragraph.
M	NORVILLE	'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
M	HUDSUCKER	-- tough titty toenails!
M	HUDSUCKER	...That'll show the bastard!
M	HUDSUCKER	...Yeah, go ahead.
M	NORVILLE	'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
M	HUDSUCKER	...Geez.
M	HUDSUCKER	Yup. It's all there. Well, see that it gets delivered in the morning.
M	HUDSUCKER	Sheeel beeee...
M	HUDSUCKER	...Ridin' six white horses, She'll be ridin' six white horses She'll be ridin' six white horses When she comes... What the heck's he doin', Benny?
M	BENNY (O.S.)	What the heck's she doin', Lou?
M	LOU (O.S.)	What the heck they doin'? You know what they're doin' now, Lou. This I know, Benny.
M	BENNY (O.S.)	This you're familia' with. ...Geez. ...Geez.
M	LOU (O.S.)	...Y'all right, Benny? ...Yeah, I'm... It's just... It's beautiful, Lou!
M	LOU (O.S.)	It is beautiful, Benny. ...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
M	LOU (O.S.)	It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
M	BARTENDER	You cats comin' from a party?
M	BENNY	Cabbies' affair.
M	LOU	Hacks' New Year's gala.
M	BARTENDER	Crazy. Get you anything else? Sangria? Carrot juice? Herbal tea?
M	LOU	Bromo.
M	BENNY	...Bromo.
M	MOSES (V.O.)	And so began 1959. The new year...
M	MOSES (V.O.)	...And the start of a new business cycle. When he learned that Norville owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was upset at first.
M	MOSES (V.O.)	...It's a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner was there...
M	MOSES (V.O.)	...'cause he was able to keep Sidney from harmin' his ol' self.
M	MOSES (V.O.)	...Now Norville, he went on an' ruled with wisdom and compassion...
M	MOSES (V.O.)	...and started dreamin' up them excitin' new ideas again. You know, for kids!
M	MOSES (V.O.)	...An' that's the story of how Norville Barnes climbed away up to the forty-fourth floor of the Hudsucker Buildin'...
M	MOSES (V.O.)	...an' then fell all the way down, but didn't quite squish hisself. ...Ya know, they say there was a man who jumped from the fortyfifth floor... but that's another story. Heh-heh-heh! Ya-heh-heh-heh!
