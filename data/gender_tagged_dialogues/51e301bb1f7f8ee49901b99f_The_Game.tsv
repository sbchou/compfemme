M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	SCHUYLER (on cellphone)	I've got buyers for the BG paper mill, goose the lawyers, final papers in three weeks... sure it's sad, but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself, you put it to sleep...
F	MARIA	Carol from the museum called. She's sending architect's sketches of the wing...
F	MARIA	That Business Week reporter called again--
M	SCHUYLER	Tell him to fuck himself. Nicely.
F	MARIA	--and, um, somebody who identified himself as, um, P.P. Willy.
F	MARIA	Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but he swore you'd know who he was. He wanted to meet you for lunch, I told him you had appointments all--
M	SCHUYLER	Cancel. Cancel the whole afternoon.
F	MARIA	But you--
M	SCHUYLER	Do it. Did he leave a number?
F	MARIA	No. He just said he'd be at Leo's in the Haight. At noon.
M	SCHUYLER	That's all, Maria.
F	CHRISTINE	Can I take your order?
M	SCHUYLER	I haven't seen the menu.
F	CHRISTINE	Oh, right. Here, see ya.
M	SCHUYLER	An iced tea, please--
M	DAVID	Yo, Sky. Happy birthday.
M	SCHUYLER	Thanks, "Pee-pee." I never get tired of that.
M	SCHUYLER	Well... long time.
M	DAVID	Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five years? So how you been?
M	SCHUYLER	Business as usual...
M	DAVID	How's Elizabeth? Any kids?
M	SCHUYLER	A little girl.
M	DAVID	Congrat--
M	SCHUYLER	It's not mine, she married a pediatrician in Sausalito.
M	DAVID	You're divorced... Too bad, she was actually interesting.
M	SCHUYLER	She stopped drinking, I guess getting rid of me was the 13th step.
M	DAVID	So you're all alone in the House of Pain.
M	SCHUYLER	I redecorated. Where have you been?
M	DAVID	All over. Nowhere in particular. Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep you informed of my every movement?
M	SCHUYLER	I called them off two years ago, David. You'd kicked the heroin, you'd left the ashram, you were windsurfing somewhere in Central America...
M	DAVID	It's gorgeous down there... you should go sometime.
M	SCHUYLER	Look, are you in trouble, is there anything you need? You can't have gone through the trust fund...
M	DAVID	That's not why I'm here, Sky, I just wanted to see you... I even brought a gift, for a change.
M	SCHUYLER	You didn't bake me a cake, did you?
M	DAVID	You can't still be mad about the hash brownies...
M	DAVID	Happy birthday, bro.
M	SCHUYLER	What is this.
M	DAVID	It's a bomb. Open it!
M	SCHUYLER	Consumer Recreation Services. OK...
M	DAVID	I can't tell you very much about it, that'd ruin the surprise. Just promise me you'll give 'em a call.
M	SCHUYLER	I don't get it.
M	DAVID	Just call 'em. OK look, it's simple, really. They entertain you.
M	SCHUYLER	Is this an escort service?
M	DAVID	No, it's nothing like that. They're a business, they're for real... They guarantee just one thing-- you won't be bored.
M	DAVID	They make your life fun.
M	SCHUYLER	Fun.
M	DAVID	You've heard of it. shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip
F	CHRISTINE	Sorry.
M	SCHUYLER	Just a cheesebur... how'd you find this place?
M	DAVID	Old connection used to meet me here. So you gonna call 'em?
M	SCHUYLER	You know, David, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation--
M	DAVID	"A delicate liquidation," God, you would do this...
M	SCHUYLER	David--
M	DAVID	We can't get together once without you making me feel like shit. That's important to you, isn't it?
M	SCHUYLER	What are you talking about?
M	DAVID	Forget about it, don't bother.
M	SCHUYLER	Are you still on medication...?
F	CHRISTINE	You guys know what you want?
M	DAVID	Go away.
M	DAVID	I just thought you'd like it. I did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me. And for your information, I'm not on anything anymore, I'm not even seeing a shrink, I'm in a better place than I've ever been, I'm even happy-- but that's something else I wouldn't be able to explain to you.
M	SCHUYLER	OK, OK, I'll give them a call...
M	DAVID	Whatever.
M	SCHUYLER	Look, take a pill. Just be normal for thirty seconds and tell me what this is. I hate surprises.
M	DAVID	I know.
M	SCHUYLER	Van Orton. Hello, Schuyler.
M	SCHUYLER	Eleven forty, you almost didn't make it. I always call on your birthday. How was it?
M	SCHUYLER	Oh, the usual, big party, circus clowns, naked lady in a cake... How are you, Sky?
M	SCHUYLER	I'm just fine. How are you? It wasn't a trick question. Thirty-eight, I thought that might be a-- a difficult year for you...
M	SCHUYLER	Hm? Just another birthday, another year closer to death. I meant-- because of your father.
M	SCHUYLER	Oh that's right, I guess he was 38, wasn't he? I hadn't thought about it, to tell the truth, but thank you for the reminder. Why do I call you...
M	SCHUYLER	I honestly don't know, but it's a nice change of pace from talking to your attorneys. So, still working at the hospice?
M	ELIZABETH (on speaker)	Mm-hmm, couple days a week...
M	SCHUYLER	Great, that's great. Well, give my regards to Dr. Mel and the baby-- She has a little brother on the way... we just did the ultrasound.
M	SCHUYLER	Really. Congratulations-- two kids, an official nuclear family, you must be very happy. We are, Sky. Very happy.
M	SCHUYLER	Well, you deserved someone who wanted the same things you did--
F	ELIZABETH	Are you? Happy?
M	SCHUYLER	Speaking of little brothers, I saw David today. Really?
M	SCHUYLER	He asked about you. He's on a new kick, some personal improvement cult. I'm gonna check it out, I'm sure he's getting fleeced again. Who knows, maybe it'll be good for you. Send David my love.
M	SCHUYLER	Right. Well, thanks again for calling, Elizabeth, take care. You too, Schuyler-- I mean that--
M	SCHUYLER	Mm, good luck, bye.
M	BERNARD SHAW (TV)	--for the residents of the Crescent Heights project, a truly tragic day is over at last--
M	SCHUYLER	I'll drink to that.
M	BERNARD SHAW (TV)	--up next, the latest in sports. For all of us here at CNN, thank you for watching--
F	RECEPTIONIST	Can I help you?
M	SCHUYLER	Is this Consumer Recreation Services? I have an appointment, the name's Van Orton.
F	RECEPTIONIST	Hm... I don't seem to--
M	SCHUYLER	Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week.
M	FEINGOLD	Problem?
F	RECEPTIONIST	This gentlemen says he has an appointment, but...
M	FEINGOLD	Van Orton, huh? I'll take him. Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of engineering and data analysis.
M	FEINGOLD	Sorry about the chaos, we're still in the process of moving... follow me, I've got an office around here someplace.
M	FEINGOLD	I can't remember the last time I ate in a restaurant, all I do is work...
M	SCHUYLER	I know what you mean. Look-- what is all this? chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general.
M	FEINGOLD	Application, MMPI and TAT tests, financial statement... Want some? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown... The tests serve a threefold purpose. First off, are you right for us? Are we right for you? Unfortunately, there's a limited number of slots--
M	SCHUYLER	Let's back up here--
M	FEINGOLD	B, we need an idea of your abilities and limitations, what turns you on, and off. Numero tres, our insurance company requires it. You're familiar with our service, aren't you?
M	SCHUYLER	Not at all. What are you selling?
M	FEINGOLD	Well... it's a game.
M	SCHUYLER	A game.
M	FEINGOLD	Recharges the batteries, gets you off the treadmill, it's an experience. Sort of a-- vacation for the guy who's been everywhere.
M	SCHUYLER	This really doesn't sound like my sort of--
M	SCHUYLER	What's so amusing?
M	FEINGOLD	Nothing. I know who you are. You're David Van Orton's brother, he got you in here.
M	SCHUYLER	So.
M	FEINGOLD	David was-- impressive, one of the better I've seen. But frankly, I can see you're not the type.
M	SCHUYLER	The type.
M	FEINGOLD	You know, a player.
M	SCHUYLER	I'm not a player.
M	FEINGOLD	I don't mean anything personal by it-- I know you're an important guy, powerful guy, you're used to being on top. It's just, this isn't for everyone. Not everyone can handle it.
M	SCHUYLER	What kind of fu-- game is this?
M	FEINGOLD	The ultimate fucking game. I wish I could tell you more, but it's different every time. Thanks for coming in--
M	SCHUYLER	I'm not an idiot. I see what you're doing. First the vague yet intriguing pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like my manhood's in question because I'm not up for, what, some motivational role-playing fantasy nonsense--
M	FEINGOLD	Interesting, you don't know the first thing about it but you've already decided what it is... Listen, I don't wanna waste any more--
M	SCHUYLER	Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get shit. I've got the afternoon free, I'll take your silly tests.
M	FEINGOLD	Ms. Nelson, are you busy? We need someone to run Mr. Van Orton.
M	MS. NELSON	This way, sir...
M	FEINGOLD	I'll catch up with you after the physical. feel guilty when I masturbate..." each followed by TRUE and FALSE
M	SCHUYLER	David, you suck.
M	FEINGOLD	Sorry to keep you waiting, a client's head exploded... You can get dressed, we're done.
M	FEINGOLD	Looks promising at this point. You test well, you're in decent shape for someone in your tax bracket... Hm, some resistance to the psych questions, but we got the general idea...
M	FEINGOLD	We design the game around your schedule, you're free to give it as much or as little time as you wish. And of course, you can call it quits at any point.
M	SCHUYLER	This was actually a gift. Did my brother pay in advance?
M	FEINGOLD	You'd have to ask our billing department... the price varies. But our service comes with a guarantee. If you're not satisfied, there's no charge. And we've never had an unsatisfied customer...
M	SCHUYLER	You mean dissatisfied.
M	FEINGOLD	Mm, that's right-- you're a left- brain word fetishist.
M	SCHUYLER	I get that all the time.
M	SCHUYLER	So I'm supposed to sign up for a game when I don't know the rules, I don't know the object, I don't know how much it costs...
M	FEINGOLD	It's a leap of faith. But at this stage, there's no commitment-- we just need to process your application. And if you qualify, you're in for the ride of your life. What have you got to lose?
M	FEINGOLD	Initials-- initials-- sign here.
M	FEINGOLD	In blood. ---Just kidding.
M	FEINGOLD	Very good, Mr. Van Orton. Please, keep the pen.
M	SCHUYLER	When can I expect to hear--
M	FEINGOLD	We'll be in touch.
M	SCHUYLER (V. O.)	David, where the hell are you, we were supposed to meet at the club--
M	DAVID (V. O.)	Oh, shit, sorry Sky, I spaced-- next Tuesday?
M	SCHUYLER (V. O.)	I'll be in Seattle.
M	DAVID (V. O.)	Buy you lunch soon as you get back, I swear...
M	SCHUYLER (V. O.)	I checked out CRS by the way-- Hey, great, you gonna go for it?
M	SCHUYLER (V. O.)	Haven't decided yet... snippet of their conversation--
M	JOHN	--like fuckin' wildfire, just opened an office in Frisco here--
M	PETE	I played my game in New York... What do you think John, will CRS ever go public?
M	JOHN	Not likely, would you?
M	SCHUYLER	New members?
M	BARTENDER	I believe so.
M	SCHUYLER	This round's on me. two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks:
M	PETE	...last time I played Pebble, I swore I'd never pick up a club again...
M	SCHUYLER	Great thing about golf, the way it takes you out of your life... Speaking of games-- I take it you two are familiar with CRS...?
M	JOHN	Uh-oh. Time to piss...
M	PETE	Why do you ask, Schuyler?
M	SCHUYLER	I couldn't help overhearing--
M	PETE	We don't usually talk about it.
M	SCHUYLER	I only bring it up because, well, I recently tested for it.
M	PETE	Did you? Kudos.
M	SCHUYLER	I just wasn't sure if they're for real, whether it's worth it--
M	PETE	Worth it... Gee, I dunno... they did save my fucking life...
M	SCHUYLER	Sorry?
M	PETE	Look, I don't know you, you don't know me, but... I hit a certain point, nothing meant anything. My work, the wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was sick of it all, y'know? But CRS... they changed everything. "Are they for real?" Who cares, maybe nothing is. To reality.
M	JOHN	C'mon Pete.
M	PETE	Good luck, pal. You'll need it.
M	PLYMPTON	Excuse me. Excuse me! Postponing the Baer-Grace meeting is out of the question. Schuyler gets on a plane for Washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract, every side agreement, the complete closing package!
F	LAWYER	But there's simply no--
M	SCHUYLER	No is not an option. If you fail to recognize that, I'll find ten other law firms in the yellow pages that can get the job done--
M	SCHUYLER	Yes. Mr. Van Orton?
M	SCHUYLER	Yes, who is this? This is Cynthia at CRS...
M	SCHUYLER	What?! How did you get this number? I'm just calling to inform you that we've finished processing your application--
M	SCHUYLER	I'm in a meeting-- --and I'm afraid you didn't qualify.
M	SCHUYLER	--so I don't have time for-- Excuse me, what was that? Well... your application was rejected.
M	SCHUYLER	...Why? Oh, I'm afraid I don't have that information, but-- many applicants don't meet the criteria. We apologize, we hope it hasn't caused you any inconvenience--
M	SCHUYLER	This is absurd-- Thank you for thinking of CRS.
M	PLYMPTON	Bad news, Sky?
M	SCHUYLER	No, nothing. Sorry, Bob. So were there any more questions, or may I assume it's under control...
M	SCHUYLER	Hello! What are you doing here?
M	SCHUYLER	Wonderful. You OK? You dead?
M	SCHUYLER	Shit, shit, shit... ...the bill goes before the House next week, where it's expected to meet stiff opposition-- Wait, this just in... The U. S. geological service has detected a massive disturbance in the earth's crust deep beneath the northern segment of the San Andreas fault... ...they have issued a warning that a major earthquake of magnitude eight or greater is likely to hit the San Francisco Bay area within... Oh my God, the next fifteen minutes-- There is no time for an evacuation. The federal government has issued the following instructions for all residents of central and northern California... Locate emergency shut-offs for all power and gas-- Wait, there's no time for that-- just stay away from windows and doors-- Find a heavy piece of furniture such as a desk or table and get under it-- If no such furniture is immediately available, go to a window or doorway-- But first turn off all power and gas. Crouch in a comfortable position, put your head between your knees and cover it with your arms-- Then KISS YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS GOODBYE!
M	BERNARD SHAW (on TV)	Howdy Sky. Que pasa? Welcome to the Game! Congratulations on your decision to let Consumer Recreation Services entertain you.
M	SCHUYLER	Fuckers! This might be a good time to lay out a few ground rules, help you enjoy your adventure. You've received the first key. There will be others. Pay attention-- you never know where you'll find 'em, you never know when you'll need 'em, so keep 'em with you at all times...
M	CYBERSHAW (on TV)	You might want to write this number down, it's the CRS hotline, operators are standing by to assist... but please don't call to ask what the object of the game is-- figuring that out is the object of the game...
M	BERNARD SHAW (on TV)	--reaction on wall Street was muted following the Fed's announcement of... You've reached CRS...
M	SCHUYLER	Yeah, this is pretty impressive but listen-- Our office is closed. Please call back during business hours. My name is Schuyler Van Orton, my game just started. Look, this is a bad time, I'm about to leave town--
M	SCHUYLER	I'm expecting a package with some documents. Did it arrive?
M	RASTA MAN	Ay mon, got sometin' fo you mon.
M	DRIVER	Get lost, pal.
M	RASTA MAN	No can do. Bob, it's Sky, what the hell is going on? No, the papers aren't here, you'll have to fax signature copies straight to the BG offices now. Yeah I'll hold.
M	RASTA MAN	You want what I got, mon.
M	SCHUYLER	No thank you.
M	RASTA MAN	Dere are many paths to enlightenment, but you must choose one and stay on it-- or you will surely die in the darkness--
M	SCHUYLER	I'll take my chances. What?! Fire their asses, that's it.
M	RASTA MAN	Jah Love mon, dat's the key, dat's the key...
M	SCHUYLER	Alan! What's wrong with a car--
F	BAER	I'm giving you an overview of our little operation! You gotta see the new breed of high yield saplings...
F	BAER	How was your flight?
M	SCHUYLER	Fine.
F	BAER	You've been planning this for months, haven't you? Sandbagging me like this, selling us for scrap...
M	SCHUYLER	BG lumber is not profitable and hasn't been for years, my duty is to salvage what I can. These are the closing papers, in ten minutes I'm going to present the sale terms to the shareholders and elect my new management team.
F	BAER	I was friends with your father, you bastard, I watched you grow up, and now you kick me in the balls--
M	BAER (O.S.)	That's not how you play the game.
F	BAER	You could've fucking told me!
M	SCHUYLER	What game?
M	SCHUYLER	Never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft.
F	BAER	Can't find your keys?
M	SCHUYLER	Where are they.
F	BAER	Up your ass?
M	SCHUYLER	Up my ass, very funny...
M	SCHUYLER	I don't-- OK. OK, you're with CRS...
M	SCHUYLER	So the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal...
F	BAER	I'm not following you.
M	SCHUYLER	Like hell you aren't. How did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable.
M	ASSISTANT	Um... sorry to interrupt. We've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material. It's all OK now.
M	ASSISTANT	Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these yours? The pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper... like an R.) It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..."
M	SCHUYLER	Everything seems to be in order. Please disregard my last comments. The shareholders meeting is about to get underway... Shall we? Flight 177 to San Francisco is now boarding at Gate 14...
M	RASTA MAN	Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention.
M	SCHUYLER	Listen, I quit.
M	RASTA MAN	Free at last... you won't be needin' this, then.
M	SCHUYLER	No, cretin. I'm quitting the game.
M	RASTA MAN	Wha's that, mon? I didna hear you.
M	SCHUYLER	I said I-- shit!
M	RASTA MAN	Help, help! The mon is crazy!
M	SCHUYLER	Where is it?
M	RASTA MAN	Got something better.
M	SCHUYLER	I realize you're just some bit player, but I'd like you to get a message to your employers. This bullshit is interfering with my work, it's breaking my concentration and I can't allow that to happen--
M	SCHUYLER	If I take that stupid key, will you give me back my briefcase and go away?
M	SCHUYLER	What the fuck am I doing?!
M	RASTA MAN	Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit.
M	RASTA MAN	So try looking at it through rose- colored glasses... here. Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice:
M	SCHUYLER	I told you, this is over! I quit!
M	RASTA MAN	They all say that at first.
M	SCHUYLER	I was supposed to meet someone here, a David Van Orton-- I was wondering if he'd left a message.
M	RONNIE	'Fraid not, sorry.
F	CHRISTINE	Fuck me!
M	SCHUYLER	Oh this is cute. Very cute.
M	RONNIE	What happened here, you OK?
F	CHRISTINE	It was an accident--
M	SCHUYLER	No it wasn't.
M	SCHUYLER	What's next, a giant banana peel?
F	CHRISTINE	Huh? Oh I get it-- you're nuts.
M	RONNIE	Chrissy, just apologize...
F	CHRISTINE	Dickhead here was on the phone, he walked right into me!
M	SCHUYLER	Drop the act, you've been waiting all day for this moment.
F	CHRISTINE	Shut the fuck up.
M	RONNIE	Go home, you're fired.
F	CHRISTINE	What?...
M	RONNIE	You heard me.
F	CHRISTINE	Fuck you too.
M	SCHUYLER	Let's get this over with... Where's the next key? Does she have it?
M	SCHUYLER	I wish you people could be a little more subtle.
F	CHRISTINE	Asshole, just send me the goddamn dry-cleaning bill. Could you--?
M	SCHUYLER	Don't you have something for me?
F	CHRISTINE	Uh-huh sure, here you go.
M	SCHUYLER	Wait, you really work here--
F	CHRISTINE	Not anymore, thanks to you.
M	SCHUYLER	Slow down-- you don't understand, I thought it was a gag.
F	CHRISTINE	No, you don't understand. I carry mace and I know how to use it.
M	SCHUYLER	I was only trying to apologize.
F	CHRISTINE	Shit, it's in here somewhere--
M	SCHUYLER	Fine.
F	CHRISTINE	Shit--
F	CHRISTINE	You got a fucking phone, call an ambulance!
M	SCHUYLER	This is just too weird-- it can't be real--
F	CHRISTINE	You really are insane!
F	CHRISTINE	We need an ambulance, guy's having a heart attack near the MUNI station at 5th and Market-- What's the number on this thing?!
M	SCHUYLER	I don't give it out--
F	CHRISTINE	731-5723-- yeah, thanks--
M	SCHUYLER	Is there anything I can do?
M	PARAMEDIC #1	Could you come with us, help us fill out a few forms--
M	SCHUYLER	No! I have work to do--
F	CHRISTINE	I'll go.
M	SCHUYLER	Wait a minute, you've got my phone--
F	CHRISTINE	Chill, will you?!
M	SCHUYLER	I don't want to be here.
F	CHRISTINE	Neither do I, now siddown, get outta their way!
M	SCHUYLER	I'd like my phone back please.
M	SCHUYLER	Oh, this day keeps getting better.
F	CHRISTINE	What is your problem, you think the whole fucking world revolves around you?
M	SCHUYLER	As a matter of fact...
F	CHRISTINE	What the fuck is going on?!
M	SCHUYLER	It's a little hard to explain...
F	CHRISTINE	Try!
M	SCHUYLER	I seem to be playing a game. This is supposed to be funny--
F	CHRISTINE	I don't get it.
M	SCHUYLER	--a challenge, a puzzle.
F	CHRISTINE	OK, I'm puzzled. Where are we?
M	SCHUYLER	Damn it, no signal.
F	CHRISTINE	Here's a lightswitch--
M	SCHUYLER	I wouldn't--
M	SCHUYLER	I don't know the rules, if there are any, but it seems the obvious move usually backfires...
F	CHRISTINE	Of course. I have no idea what you're talking about.
F	CHRISTINE	Son of a bitch.
M	SCHUYLER	I think I have a key.
M	SCHUYLER	Damn it... Wrong key...
F	CHRISTINE	Last match.
F	CHRISTINE	Too bright for you, is it?
M	SCHUYLER	I can see now. Grab my arm.
F	CHRISTINE	No way! You're crazy!
M	SCHUYLER	Stay on the path!
M	SCHUYLER	Christine, don't move!
F	CHRISTINE	Leave me alone!
F	CHRISTINE	Help!
F	CHRISTINE	Aaggh! BUGS!!
M	SCHUYLER	Where are the glasses?!
F	CHRISTINE	Fuck the glasses!
M	SCHUYLER	We can't get out of here without them!
M	SCHUYLER	They're rubber. Hold onto me, I'll get us out of here.
F	CHRISTINE	Ha!
M	SCHUYLER	Fine, stay.
F	CHRISTINE	No!
M	SCHUYLER	What's your favorite color?
F	CHRISTINE	...Blue?
F	CHRISTINE	Wow... OK, this is kinda cool. Hey!
M	SCHUYLER	Sorry, it's my game. But we'll take blue.
F	CHRISTINE	Talk about the blind leading the blind... what's your name anyway?
M	SCHUYLER	Sky Van Orton.
F	CHRISTINE	Sky? Were your folks hippies or something?
M	SCHUYLER	Far from it.
F	CHRISTINE	I'm Christine Kaminsky.
M	SCHUYLER	Nice to meet you.
M	SCHUYLER	It's a company called Consumer Recreation Services, CRS. I never know what's gonna happen next.
F	CHRISTINE	Well, who does.
M	SCHUYLER	Until recently, I had a pretty good idea... Duck.
F	CHRISTINE	So are you like a serious masochist, or just really, really bored?
M	SCHUYLER	I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been dragged into this.
F	CHRISTINE	Well... I have to tell you something. Some guy came into Leo's yesterday, showed me your picture, offered me 250 bucks to spill that food on you.
M	SCHUYLER	Ah.
F	CHRISTINE	Said it was a practical joke. I figured what the hell, I can use the money-- I got him up to 500. I hated that fucking job anyway--
M	SCHUYLER	Wait, so the heart attack, you knew that was a joke too--
F	CHRISTINE	No! It scared the shit out of me--
M	SCHUYLER	But that CPR routine--
F	CHRISTINE	I used to be a lifeguard.
M	SCHUYLER	We're getting somewhere...
F	CHRISTINE	How do we get up there?
F	CHRISTINE	Well, that was pointless... but different... kind of fun...
M	SCHUYLER	Mm, a different kind of fun. What's your middle name?
F	CHRISTINE	Louise... why?
M	SCHUYLER	You're supposed to be here... they picked you for a reason.
F	CHRISTINE	But-- why?
M	SCHUYLER	Probably knew you'd play Good Samaritan for that guy, drag me along-- but they could have hired an actor for that, less of a risk...
F	CHRISTINE	This is really sick. I think they're trying to fix us up.
M	SCHUYLER	Maybe you can't play alone--
F	CHRISTINE	Who says I want to play? OK, what the fuck are you doing in the dumpster.
M	SCHUYLER	There's something in here I need.
F	CHRISTINE	What's that for?
M	SCHUYLER	I imagine I'll find out.
F	CHRISTINE	What are you looking at?
M	SCHUYLER	This is their offices. We must have been in their garage... my office is just a few blocks from here, we can get cleaned up there.
F	CHRISTINE	Your turn.
M	SCHUYLER	Find everything you need?
F	CHRISTINE	You're outta conditioner.
M	SCHUYLER	My apologies, I'll have it taken care of. Help yourself to the fridge.
M	CHRISTINE (O. S.)	So um... how rich are you anyway?
M	SCHUYLER	Rich enough. Bit forward, aren't you? Well, what exactly do you do?
M	SCHUYLER	Manage investments, some venture capital, I'm on the board of a number of publicly traded companies...
M	CHRISTINE (O. S.)	So you just like, move money around?
M	SCHUYLER	Basically. Beats working, huh?
F	CHRISTINE	You don't look so bad, without the tie.
M	SCHUYLER	Look, I hope you haven't been too put out... I could probably get you another job, I have a stake in a couple of restaurants--
F	CHRISTINE	I'm not much of a waitress, really. Y'know, today's been kind of--
M	SCHUYLER	Can you type?
F	CHRISTINE	Kind of a turn-on, you know? I didn't mean-- just, the danger... Like fucking in a graveyard.
M	SCHUYLER	Mm. So where do you live?
F	CHRISTINE	Out in Concord, with my folks, unfortunately. They're never gonna believe that I've been hanging out with a guy like you.
M	SCHUYLER	What do you mean?
F	CHRISTINE	Nothing, just-- most of the guys I see have tats, y'know? Tattoos...
M	SCHUYLER	Of course. We'd better head downstairs, the limo's waiting.
F	CHRISTINE	Mind if I smoke in here?
M	SCHUYLER	Yes. Up here on the left.
F	CHRISTINE	So what's our next move? I mean, in the game. Obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for--
M	SCHUYLER	I'm not playing anymore.
F	CHRISTINE	Why not?
M	SCHUYLER	I have a life. Jack'll take you home, or wherever you want to go.
F	CHRISTINE	Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little ballroom dancing before bed--
F	CHRISTINE	Wait, what about your clothes?
M	SCHUYLER	Forget it.
F	CHRISTINE	C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt.
M	SCHUYLER	No, it's not-- just-- back from the cleaners.
F	CHRISTINE	You dry clean your sweatshirts...
F	CHRISTINE	See ya. he waves a hand.
M	SCHUYLER	Good night.
M	DAVID	Drive. Anywhere.
M	SCHUYLER	Jesus, David, you scared the shit out of me--
M	DAVID	I'm sorry Sky, just drive, please--
M	SCHUYLER	Where were you today?
M	DAVID	I almost didn't make it at all. I been in the bar for hours, waiting for you to come back to your car-- Jesus, I can't believe I did this to you, I'm so sorry--
M	SCHUYLER	Slow down, take a breath-- what are you talking about?
M	DAVID	The game! It just doesn't stop! I thought I'd finished playing a long time ago, I paid the bill, then it started all over again, they won't leave me alone--
M	SCHUYLER	Calm down. What are they doing to you?
M	DAVID	Everything. It just doesn't stop.
M	SCHUYLER	Look. That's crazy. Yes, it's a pain in the ass, but why would they keep playing once you paid them?
M	DAVID	I don't know! I paid them MORE to make it stop, God help me I even gave you to them... but they won't leave me alone!
M	DAVID	What's this?
M	SCHUYLER	It was on my windshield--
M	DAVID	Oh shit, oh SHIT they must be following us--
M	DAVID	They're shooting at us!
M	SCHUYLER	David, get a grip, it's just a flat tire!
M	SCHUYLER	Damn it, the phone's not working--
M	DAVID	Of course not.
M	SCHUYLER	Fine, I'll change the fucking thing myself.
M	DAVID	Just hurry-- I'll pop the trunk.
M	SCHUYLER	No, you can't do it from--
M	SCHUYLER	What the fuck are those--
M	DAVID	Like you don't know. Sonofabitch, they got to you first, didn't they?
M	SCHUYLER	Um, David-- hello?
M	DAVID	It's more than that isn't it? You're part of it, you're one of them! Of course, it makes perfect sense!
M	SCHUYLER	They planted those keys! I don't know what the hell they're for--
M	DAVID	You're behind the whole thing aren't you? You and your sick fucking friends set it up--
M	SCHUYLER	What?! What friends? Get a grip, David-- why would I do that?
M	DAVID	I don't know, out of boredom, to get back at me--
M	SCHUYLER	For what?!
M	DAVID	For being a weirdo, for trying to be happy? Well, congratulations, you win. Now make it stop!
M	SCHUYLER	I can't! Listen to me--
M	DAVID	Fuck you!
M	SCHUYLER (on phone)	What have you done to my brother, you bastards?! This is over, I'm not playing anymore-- Hello, is anyone there--
M	PHONE VOICE	If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again-- if you need help--
M	SCHUYLER	Six three six Mission, please.
M	SCHUYLER	You're heading the wrong way.
M	CABBIE (filter)	Relax, pal, you'll get where you're going.
M	SCHUYLER	Why are you doing this-- We do it all for you! We're the best friends you got, no one ever worked so hard to make you feel alive... but you gotta let it happen...
M	SCHUYLER	What the fuck is this--
M	CABBIE/RASTA	Have a nice day...
M	GIRL	Mister-- are you all right?!
M	SCHUYLER	Thank you... I'm very grateful.
M	GIRL	Shouldn't swim in the Bay, you could get hepatitis.
M	SCHUYLER	I have to get in touch with the police.
M	GIRL	You're freezing, I got some dry clothes below.
M	GIRL	Do you need any help?
M	SCHUYLER	Uh, no. I'm fine. These fit... ...perfectly.
M	GIRL	Sure I can't do something for you?
M	SCHUYLER	I am finished playing.
M	GIRL	OW! Let go!
M	SCHUYLER	This has got to fucking STOP!
M	GIRL	You're hurting me!
M	SCHUYLER	Who are you!?
M	GIRL	I just got hired to show you a good time! C'mon please get off me...
M	GIRL	I am not into this kinda shit!
M	SCHUYLER	Who hired you.
M	GIRL	I don't know, the service set it up.
M	SCHUYLER	The service?
M	GIRL	Y'know, Fantasy Girls. They said you had this wild fantasy, I should just wait in the boat...
M	GIRL	Doncha want your thing? I'm supposed to give you this, this key thingie...
M	SCHUYLER	A key.
M	GIRL	They said you'd figure out what to do with it.
M	SCHUYLER	I'm supposed to carry a fucking hatchet around...? Relax. I don't want it.
M	PLYMPTON	Thank you for your promptness, officers. I'm Robert Plympton, Mr. Van Orton's attorney--
M	SCHUYLER	Let's go. Seventh floor.
M	BARNETT	Management company for the building said this floor hasn't been rented. We checked with the Secretary of State and the county recorder, there's no listing of a "consumer research service."
M	PLYMPTON	Recreation service.
M	BARNETT	Right. No sign of the boat or the girl. Divers got the cab's vehicle ID, the company junked it a month ago.
M	GALLO	The numbers you gave us are disconnected, sir, this was the only address the phone company had. And we found your car-- it's in impound.
M	BARNETT	I'm a little confused as to motive here. You said your brother sent you to these people...
M	SCHUYLER	It's not his fault, he's unstable, he didn't know what he was doing--
M	BARNETT	And they were supposed to show you a, a good time?
M	GALLO	My guess is this Feingold guy's using an alias... is there anything else you can tell us about him?
M	SCHUYLER	He likes Chinese food...
M	BARNETT	Don't worry, Mr. Van Orton, we'll get these jokers.
M	PLYMPTON	There's clearly a civil case once we locate the defendant...
M	SCHUYLER	Whatever.
M	PLYMPTON	Y'know, Sky, things are quiet since the closing-- you could take some time off.
M	SCHUYLER	Oh, God-- RED SIGNATURE ARROW is affixed by a DOTTED LINE at the bottom,
M	ACTION HERO (on TV)	Don't touch that dial, Sky! Boy oh boy, you fucked up big-time! Bringing in the cops-- real mistake!
M	SCHUYLER	No no no-- Oh you're always so negative...
M	SCHUYLER	You people are insane... TV set.
M	SCHUYLER	How did you do this, how did you get in here? Simple, we duped your keys the day you came in for your physical, wired the whole house while you were at work. You rich people all have alarms, but you never set 'em, do you?
M	SCHUYLER	Look, at least leave my brother alone, he's fragile enough as it is-- Don't worry about him, he's just playing his own game-- at a more advanced level, you might say...
M	SCHUYLER	You can't just fuck with people like this, you don't know who you're dealing with! We know exactly who we're dealing with, that's the whole idea! For a guy with your test scores, you're pretty slow on the uptake.
M	SCHUYLER	What the fuck do you want from me?! Sky, I just came to say good- bye... Too bad it didn't work out, better luck next time. Uh, there might be a few loose ends for you to tie up, but remember-- it's not whether you win or lose that counts, it's how you play the game... ya big loser you... Ouch! Take it easy, my hot-headed friend! Holy smoke, this was an expensive TV-- Now what?! Is this Schuyler Van Orton? Yeah, who's this? I'm calling from the Claremont Hotel in Berkeley... we have your American Express card, you left it at the check-in desk... What? That's impossible, I've never stayed there-- Are you sure, sir?
M	SCHUYLER	Son of a bitch.
M	BELLHOP	Hello, Mr. Van Orton.
M	DESK CLERK	Mr. Van Orton. Here's your credit card... and the maid found this under the bed...
M	SCHUYLER	That isn't mine.
M	DESK CLERK	It has your initials on it, sir.
M	DESK CLERK	We'd just as soon you took it with you, in any event... and in the future, you might consider choosing another hotel for your...
M	SCHUYLER	I've never been here before in my life!
M	SCHUYLER	Jack... the woman you took home the other night, where did you go?
M	JACK	Out to Concord...
M	SCHUYLER	I know, what was the address?
M	JACK	Mmm... it was... Beulah Drive, I think, yeah, offa Oakdale... but didn't you-- never mind.
M	SCHUYLER	What?
M	JACK	Just-- I thought you followed us there. There was a black 500SE behind us the whole way, I just assumed...
M	SCHUYLER	Shit. Shit! It wasn't me, Jack.
M	JACK	Of course, sir. It was a white house, I remember... big tree in the front... with one of those, you know, tire swings...
M	SCHUYLER	Jack, I'm serious. It wasn't me.
M	JACK	It wasn't you, sir.
M	IMPOUND WORKER	Triple A changed your tire... bad blow-out was it? Anyone hurt?
M	IMPOUND WORKER	Oh. Just... we were a little curious about the mess in the back...
M	SCHUYLER	A friend's dog-- he'd been hit by a car, I drove him to the vet... Golden retriever, beautiful animal.
M	IMPOUND WORKER	He OK?
M	SCHUYLER	Too early to say.
M	MR. KAMINSKY	Yes?
M	SCHUYLER	Mr. Kaminsky? Schuyler Van Orton--
M	MR. KAMINSKY	Is that a name? Look, I'm kinda busy.
M	SCHUYLER	You have a daughter named Christine? I'm afraid she might be in danger.
M	CHRISTINE (O. S.)	Daddy? Who is it?
F	CHRISTINE	Sky? Hi, Sky.
M	DAD	Well, I'm gonna get back to that carburetor... nice meeting you.
F	CHRISTINE	I didn't think I'd-- what are you doing here?
M	SCHUYLER	Last night, when Jack dropped you off-- did anything happen?
F	CHRISTINE	No... unfortunately.
M	SCHUYLER	I thought-- eh, you don't wanna know.
F	CHRISTINE	Come on--
M	SCHUYLER	I thought they kidnapped you, tortured you--
F	CHRISTINE	What? Who?
M	SCHUYLER	CRS... I saw pictures, girl with a tattoo on her shoulder like yours--
F	CHRISTINE	Ssh, my folks don't know about that yet. So, what-- they wanted ransom from you or something?
M	SCHUYLER	No, I thought they were trying to frame me, they planted evidence...
F	CHRISTINE	Why would they do that?
M	SCHUYLER	I have no idea, nothing they do makes any sense. Forget it, it's just a game.
F	CHRISTINE	So that's the only reason you came out here to East Hell, your stupid goddamn game.
M	SCHUYLER	I was worried about you. I wanted to see you again.
F	CHRISTINE	If you pretend to mean that, I'll pretend to believe it. Well, looks like your pals are trying to keep us together. Buy me dinner at least?
M	SCHUYLER	Sure, why not.
F	CHRISTINE	I look like a slob, let me change. white dress, holding flowers.
F	CHRISTINE	Can you get us into Chez Panisse? I always wanted to eat there--
M	SCHUYLER	Is that you?
F	CHRISTINE	Mm-hmm, First Communion. What's the matter, you look a little green around the gills--
M	SCHUYLER	Don't touch me.
F	CHRISTINE	Don't be stupid. Don't say anything, not here, they're watching.
M	SCHUYLER	God damn it...
F	CHRISTINE	OK, I know a good place we could go and like, be alone...
F	CHRISTINE	It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
F	CHRISTINE	There's four of them in the van, they're armed. Just play along, I'll get us out of here--
M	SCHUYLER	Fuck you. OK, that's it, game over--
M	SCHUYLER (FILTER)	--you can come out now, assholes--
M	RASTA MAN'S VOICE	We're blown, let's do it--
F	CHRISTINE	You idiot! Come on!
M	SCHUYLER	No, enough already. I've had it.
M	SCHUYLER	Now what.
F	CHRISTINE	Get away from there!!
M	SCHUYLER	Oh, now I suppose they're going to--
M	SCHUYLER	Holy shit!!
M	SCHUYLER	What is this!?
F	CHRISTINE	God, wake up, it's a con game!
F	CHRISTINE	Watch out!!
F	CHRISTINE	OK, we lost 'em--
F	CHRISTINE	What are you doing!?
M	SCHUYLER	Get out of my car. I coulda handed you to them! They find me now I'm dead--
F	CHRISTINE	Listen to me you bastard-- I know what's going on! No one else is gonna tell you!
M	SCHUYLER	Get in.
M	SCHUYLER	You can talk while I drive to the police station.
F	CHRISTINE	No cops, I got an outstanding warrant. Mail fraud. I'll get nailed, but you'll never be able to prove a thing. Just drive.
F	CHRISTINE	Heard about this big swindle and-- I needed the money. You wouldn't know what that's like.
M	SCHUYLER	Spare me the snide comments. And please don't do that in here--
F	CHRISTINE	Second-hand smoke is the least of your problems. Shit, they really screwed up, I can't believe they didn't take the time to get the house right.
M	SCHUYLER	Wait, how did-- before the game, you were working in that bar--
F	CHRISTINE	They planted me in advance, your brother set you up.
M	SCHUYLER	Oh God, David's in on it...?
F	CHRISTINE	It's not his fault, he thought it was the only way out... just another victim.
M	SCHUYLER	How the hell did they think they were gonna get my money?
F	CHRISTINE	Honey, they already got it.
F	CHRISTINE	You don't believe me, check your bank accounts. Listen, that night in your office, remember? I downloaded files off your computer while you were in the shower...
M	CHRISTINE (V. O.)	I stuck in a code-breaking program to glve CRS remote access to Van Orton Group files... --you'd already given them everything else they needed. Your handwriting, voice samples, personal information, all the tests you took... they used the data to generate your passwords.
M	CHRISTINE (V. O.)	From there they just had to break into the financial networks, transfer your holdings into some dummy accounts--
M	CHRISTINE (V. O.)	Remember Jim Feingold, guy who signed you up? He's one of the original hackers, did a five-year stretch for zapping Citibank.
M	CHRISTINE (V. O.)	He's not some dweeb flunkie, he runs the whole show.
F	CHRISTINE	I'm sorry. They already did your brother, I guess they figured you for a family of suckers... Overseas operator? Please dial the number for Allgemeine Bank in Zurich...
F	CHRISTINE	Bet you haven't really been taking care of business the past few days, huh? This "game," the psych shit about your dad going sui... Guten tag-- Vilen dank, Englisch...
F	CHRISTINE	All of it was just to buy time, keep you from paying attention... Blue Two-Five... 6-9-0-D... Yes, I consent to voice-print... My name is Schuyler Van Orton. I'd like to know my balance, please... that account is closed?! I think maybe you should pull over...
M	SCHUYLER (on phone)	Bob, listen carefully, this is an emergency. Feingold and his people, I've called all my banks, they've drained the accounts, personal and corporate, everything-- tell the cops I've got one of them with me, we'll make her testify. They're trying to kill us, I'm heading for the island in Oregon, if I can still find it. Bob-- call when you get this message and-- be extremely careful...
M	CLERK	They say I gotta confiscate your card...
F	CHRISTINE	I think I have some cash.
F	CHRISTINE	Money isn't everything, right?
M	SCHUYLER	It might be best if you didn't speak. I very nearly crushed your skull just now.
F	CHRISTINE	C'mon chill, what'd they take you for, a couple hundred G's? Chump change for a guy like you, chalk it up to experience.
M	SCHUYLER	Just under a billion dollars.
F	CHRISTINE	A bil--? You're kidding, right?
M	SCHUYLER	Do I look like I'm kidding? This is about more than my personal lifestyle-- your pals raided pension plans, charitable foundations, company payrolls...
F	CHRISTINE	Oh my God--
M	SCHUYLER	I don't know what kind of jerk-off con games you've played in the past, but now you're in the big leagues, hon. You just helped sabotage a small portion of the national economy-- and destroy a whole lotta lives.
M	SCHUYLER	You're not having any?
F	CHRISTINE	Never drink it. Makes my tits hurt.
M	SCHUYLER	Hold still.
M	SCHUYLER	Sorry, this place hasn't been cleaned in a while. My dad built it himself, spent a lot of time here alone. Rotten carpenter...
F	CHRISTINE	Thank you.
F	CHRISTINE	What's so funny?
M	SCHUYLER	Just-- private joke...
F	CHRISTINE	Tell me.
M	SCHUYLER	Well... I always told myself I wasn't gonna end up like him. And now here I am, running his corporation, living in his house, hiding in the cabin where he went to hide right before he... I even look like the bastard.
F	CHRISTINE	Not that much.
M	SCHUYLER	Mm, plus I'm a helluva lot more gullible than he ever was...
M	SCHUYLER	Yes.
M	PLYMPTON (filter)	It's me, Schuyler... I got your message... I'll admlt, I was very disturbed...
M	SCHUYLER	My, lawyer. So. What's our next move? I've been on the phone all morning... your funds are intact, nothing's changed, there's been no activity whatsoever...
M	SCHUYLER	Wait-- that's not true-- It is true, no one is after your money, no one is trying to hurt you--
F	CHRISTINE	He's in on it.
M	SCHUYLER	Oh, God... Listen to me, Sky!
M	SCHUYLER	What are they paying you, Robert? Piece of the action? Schuyler! Look, you've done the right thing going up there, maybe it's best if you just sit tight for a while, forget about everything, it's all under control--
M	SCHUYLER	We have to get out of here!
M	SCHUYLER	Well, that was stupid.
M	SCHUYLER	OK, they've gotten to him. OK. Is there anyone I can trust?
F	CHRISTINE	Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
M	SCHUYLER	What do you mean?
F	CHRISTINE	It's out of your hands.
M	SCHUYLER	Christine!!
F	CHRISTINE	That's not my name.
M	SCHUYLER	Why...
F	CHRISTINE	We needed you to call your banks. Cellular calls can be intercepted, rerouted, y'know.
F	CHRISTINE	All those calls to Switzerland and Chase Manhattan-- you were talking to our people. See, we were still missing a lotta pieces-- access codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton didn't have-- but now we have I everything. I guess you are pretty fucking stupid-- but thanks.
F	CHRISTINE	It's over. Just let go... quite beautiful and peaceful...
M	SCHUYLER	What?
M	SCHUYLER	Where am I?!
M	SCHUYLER	Please, help me, I'm an American! I'm lost! Please!!
M	SCHUYLER	Hello. Where am I?
M	DESK SERGEANT	Tegucigalpa. Tegucigalpa. Tegucigalpa?
M	SCHUYLER	That's gibberish!
M	DESK SERGEANT	It is the capital of Honduras.
M	SCHUYLER	Right.
M	DESK SERGEANT	So-- you have become, lost from, from your father...?
M	SCHUYLER	My father's dead, God damn it. I have to get to the United States embassy.
M	DESK SERGEANT	Do you know what this says?
M	WORKER	"I am an American. I am an idiot. My father is very rich. If I become lost, please take me to the police. There is a reward."
M	WORKER	Mr. Van Orton... is this a joke of some sort? What are you doing here?
M	SCHUYLER	I don't know.
M	WORKER	Well, without any identification it will take at least a week to get you a temporary visa--
M	SCHUYLER	A week?! Christ knows what they can do in a week-- and what the hell am I supposed to, to live on?! What day is it anyway? Where's the nearest pawn shop?
M	PAWN SHOP OWNER	This will buy you a plane ticket.
M	SCHUYLER	Yeah, well I, I seem to have lost my passport...
M	SCHUYLER	Huh, close enough...
M	PAWN SHOP OWNER	I throw them in. This man says he can help you...
M	SCHUYLER	No. Fuck you... I'm going to live...
M	NURSE	The medication seems to be helping. Unfortunately we're going to have to transfer your brother to a public institution in a few days, his funds are entirely exhausted-- unless you're prepared to take responsibility...
M	SCHUYLER	David...
M	DAVID	Hello Sky...
M	SCHUYLER	What are you doing here?
M	DAVID	Sorry, I was just eating... I'm much better. Really.
M	SCHUYLER	Thank God... Listen, I know you put them onto me-- but I understand, we're both victims of this thing... They've stolen everything we ever had, they're trying to drive us both crazy-- but we won't let them. We'll find a way. There's gotta be a way to beat these bastards! We're in it together...
M	DAVID	In what together?
M	SCHUYLER	The game.
M	DAVID	Oh, Schuyler, there is no game. It was just a fantasy of mine, a self- aggrandizing delusion... I can't believe you took that shit seriously.
M	SCHUYLER	No, David-- please...
M	DAVID	Oh, man, stop fucking with me! You know the game doesn't exist... it never did! It never did...
M	DAVID	Can you see?
M	BARNETT	So the waitress was in on it--
M	SCHUYLER	She isn't really a waitress.
M	BARNETT	--and now you're brother's been institutionalized... is there a history of mental illness in your family?
M	BARNETT	'Scuse me.
M	BARNETT	Whatcha reading?
M	SCHUYLER	Nothing.
M	GALLO	I just spoke with his lawyer Plympton, he thinks Van Orton's having a nervous breakdown, we should probably hold onto him till his people can get down here...
M	ALARM MONITOR	Probably just your keys, sir--
M	BARNETT	Yo, Schuyler, wait up--
M	PUNK	End of the line, man.
M	SCHUYLER	Are the tattoos supposed to mean something?
M	PUNK	Yeah, they mean you're dead, you don't gimme what you got.
M	SCHUYLER	OK, there's the C...
M	PUNK	Give me the fucking bag!
M	SCHUYLER	Come on, you're not going to put me through all this shit and then kill me on a fucking train, it won't look like a suicide...
M	TRANSIT COP	Freeze assholes!
M	PUNK	Psycho pulled a knife on me!
M	SCHUYLER	What do you think you're doing, this guy attacked me!
M	TRANSIT COP	Wait here--
M	RADIO VOICE #1	--can't let him get away with this, he's outta control! The next thing you know, he'll push the wrong button and we'll all be dead--
M	RADIO VOICE #2	--Whoah whoah whoah-- OK the guy's a moron, sure, but he doesn't have the balls to end the world! Anyway I'm sicka talking politics, let's get back to the business of nipple piercing-- you got a ring, don't ya Robin?
M	RADIO VOICE #2 (HOWARD STERN)	Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is the Howard Stern show...
M	SCHUYLER	Hello Elizabeth...
M	SCHUYLER	I'm sorry, I shouldn't be bothering you-- you're a genuinely good person, your work is important, it's real, nothing that happens to me is real anymore--
F	ELIZABETH	What has happened to you, Sky?
M	SCHUYLER	I need your help, you're the only one left, the only one I can trust-- not that I deserve your help, God how could you have even married me, I was a shit to you--
F	ELIZABETH	No you weren't--
M	SCHUYLER	Yes I was. Sometimes I think I'm being punished for my sins, I mean, there has to be a reason...
M	SCHUYLER	This is one of their devices, I pulled it off their assassin in the subway. It's how they communicate with each other.
F	ELIZABETH	It's... a radio...
M	SCHUYLER	I can't find the right channel... Listen, I may not make it through this-- if anything happens, get that notebook to, to, the press, or the FBI or something. Someone you can trust, I don't know, assuming you can trust anyone. I just want you to know I'm not crazy, and I didn't kill myself, no matter what they say--
M	SCHUYLER	Has this been opened?
M	BARMAID	No sir. Just like you said.
M	SCHUYLER	I don't think coffee is safe.
F	ELIZABETH	Schuyler, try and listen to me. I love you, I always have, I always will. And maybe this is... good. Maybe this a point you had to reach, before--
M	SCHUYLER	Before what?
F	ELIZABETH	Before-- I'm just glad you came to me for help. I don't know if I'm strong enough to, to handle this on my own but I know a lot of excellent crisis people--
M	SCHUYLER	Crisis people. Crisis people?
F	ELIZABETH	Hello? Hi, hon, I'm OK... um, could I call you back...?
M	SCHUYLER	You bastard! You fucking bastard! How did you find me here!? Ooof-- my head is killing me!
M	SCHUYLER	Fuck you!
M	SCHUYLER	Who are you?
M	ACTRESS (ON TV, filter)	Honey, have you taken anything?
M	FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)	Sure, some aspirin--
M	SCHUYLER	He's an actor...
F	ELIZABETH	Of course he's an actor, it's a commercial.
M	SCHUYLER	He's just a fucking actor...
M	FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)	My head feels great! Thanks to Ambutol, I'll never use aspirin again!
F	ELIZABETH	Have you taken something?
M	SCHUYLER	What?
F	ELIZABETH	Are you on drugs?
F	ELIZABETH	Schuyler, I'm calling a friend right now, I want you to wait here with me until--
M	SCHUYLER	Elizabeth, please... I'm sorry, I'II be alright, it's just been a hard day... Listen, I gotta use the restroom, be right back--
M	SCHUYLER	He's an actor, does TV commercials, I know he's ordered from you, he had food delivered to an office building on Mission--
M	CHINESE WOMAN	Many customers, very busy, I don't know, I don't know--
M	SCHUYLER	Damn it!
M	CHINESE WOMAN	Stop that, what you doing?!
M	SCHUYLER (on phone)	Yes, Mrs. Fisher, I know it's short notice but we were hoping your husband could come in for an audition today, he's perfect...
M	SCHUYLER	Isn't there any way we can get in touch with him now...? I see...
M	SCHUYLER	Bill Fisher, hi! I really admire your work...
M	FEINGOLD	Oh please... I got my kids here...
M	SCHUYLER	Get rid of them.
M	FEINGOLD	Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty! Snack time!
M	FEINGOLD	Look, buddy, it was just a job-- nothing personal, y'know? I play my part, improvise a little, that's what I'm good at, I still do a little stand-up--
M	SCHUYLER	I've seen your resume. I'm sick of foot soldiers, I've gotta get to whoever's in charge.
M	FEINGOLD	Of CRS? Christ, nobody knows, nobody gets the big picture-- Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
M	FEINGOLD	Goddammit, why do they do that.
M	SCHUYLER	How do I find them!? Their offices were abandoned--
M	FEINGOLD	They own the whole building, they just move from floor to floor.
M	SCHUYLER	OK... They know you, you've worked for them. You're going to get me inside.
M	FEINGOLD	Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but--
M	SCHUYLER	Tell them anything, tell them the cops are after you, you've gotta talk to someone or you'll blow the whistle.
M	FEINGOLD	No way, it's too dangerous.
M	SCHUYLER	You don't seem to understand. Right here, right now-- I'm the danger.
M	FEINGOLD	We're here, Sky. They said they're on the twelfth floor.
M	SCHUYLER	Drive in, then.
M	FEINGOLD	Look-- what are you gonna do? Really?
M	SCHUYLER	Really-- I don't know. Improvise. Go!
M	GATE GUARD	You're not authorized to be here.
M	GATE GUARD	Yo!
M	SECURITY MAN	You're a dead man. attention to him anyway. There's a cafeteria style counter along
F	CHRISTINE	What are you doing here?
M	SCHUYLER	I'm back from the dead.
F	CHRISTINE	Listen, everything's OK, nobody touched your money, nobody stole a thing, that's impossible--
M	SCHUYLER	I don't give a fuck about the money, I wanna know who's behind this, who did this to me, how, why--
F	CHRISTINE	It's just a game!
M	SCHUYLER	You're not going anywhere. Feingold, or or Fisher, was that just a game too?
F	CHRISTINE	What are you talking about?
M	SCHUYLER	I watched him die...
M	SCHUYLER	Seemed like a nice guy, actually, father of three--
F	CHRISTINE	Well, look, I'm sure it's just another stunt-- that can't be real, taste it.
M	SCHUYLER	You taste it, you fucking vampire.
M	GATE GUARD	Could you come with us, please? You're not authorized to be here.
M	SCHUYLER	Back off. Everybody back off.
M	SCHUYLER	Shit, how do we get out--
F	CHRISTINE	Wait a minute. What's that?
M	SCHUYLER	It's my gun...
F	CHRISTINE	We didn't give it to you? Where did it come from?
M	SCHUYLER	A gun store.
F	CHRISTINE	We searched your house!
M	SCHUYLER	Guess you fucked up again.
F	CHRISTINE	He's armed, he's got a real gun. Real Situation, real--
M	SCHUYLER	Yeah, it's real all right.
F	CHRISTINE	Schuyler this is all fake, tricks, it's all part of the game--
M	SCHUYLER	Stop it. Every word out of your mouth is a lie--
F	CHRISTINE	The key!! They, we gave you a key to the elevator! Why would we do that?! We wanted you to come up--
M	SCHUYLER	Of course you did. So you could kill me or, or frame me for murder--
F	CHRISTINE	No, no, it's THE GAME!! Blanks, squibs, high-tech special effects, none of it's real! Just open that door and I'll show you!
M	SCHUYLER	I open the door and I die.
M	SCHUYLER	You move again I swear I'll kill you, you bitch.
F	CHRISTINE	THINK ABOUT IT!! They followed you every step of the way, the cab, in the trunk, we had a diver--
M	SCHUYLER	They? We?
F	CHRISTINE	--the guy in Honduras, the cop on the train, there was always a safety net, always--
M	SCHUYLER	Shut up, shut the fuck up!! --just hang in there, keep talking him down, we're on our way-- We've been trying to end it since you got back, our people came to your house, they tried to bring you in from the subway, you kept running, you weren't supposed to keep getting lost--
M	SCHUYLER	You just said you wanted me to come here-- you're making this up as you go along!
F	CHRISTINE	Please Sky, please. Take a breath and think about it!
M	SCHUYLER	Stop. Fucking. With my head!
F	CHRISTINE	You're all right, it's OK, just relax... Are you there? How's he doing?
F	CHRISTINE	Please... when you open the door, the game ends... just open the door... Bill Fisher's out there, he's fine, nobody got hurt. Why would we do the crazy things we did, if it wasn't part of a game? We thought you knew that... --we're at the North entrance, Number 2, just a few more seconds and we'll nail him--
F	CHRISTINE	Oh God. I blew it... we blew it...
M	FEINGOLD	You shot her!? No! Qh God no...
M	FEINGOLD	He fucking shot them!!
M	RASTA	I'll call an ambulance.
M	SCHUYLER	David, David, no, no--
M	DAVID	Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, I don't wanna die, I don't wanna--
M	SCHUYLER	You're not gonna die. I'm here, you're not gonna die...
M	FEINGOLD	Hang on, just hang on, you're gonna make it--
F	CHRISTINE	That stupid...
M	FEINGOLD	Oh God. I thought you could handle it. All the tests... they said you could handle it...
F	CHRISTINE	You fucking psycho, you piece of shit, how could you--
M	FEINGOLD	God, why-- there was no point. It was supposed to be fun...
M	SCHUYLER	Fun...
M	DAVID	SKY, NOOOO!!
M	DAVID	Hey, bro, how you doin'?
M	DAVID	Admit it, you weren't bored...
M	DAVID	Jesus. Sky, c'mon Sky--
M	DAVID	You've been wanting to do that for a long, long time, haven't you?
M	DAVID	Like they'd really leave a loaded gun lying around. They went over the whole place with a metal detector, then packed that thing with blanks.
M	JOHN	Good one, buddy, really had you going, didn't we?
M	PETE	Wait'll you try level two... Joke.
M	RASTA	That look on your face up there? Shit, man, I almost lost it.
F	RECEPTIONIST	Awesome game-- best I've seen.
M	FEINGOLD	Sure glad you jumped, compadre. Otherwise I was supposed to throw you off. It's not strictly legal, so don't tell anyone... The cigar. It's a Monte Cristo, straight from Havana.
F	CHRISTINE	Hey... you all right?
M	SCHUYLER	I think so. You?
F	CHRISTINE	Little shook. I'm pretty much a method actress, y'know?
M	SCHUYLER	What's your name?
F	CHRISTINE	Susan. Susan Waters.
M	SCHUYLER	Nice to meet you, Susan...
F	CHRISTINE	Can I have a puff?
M	SCHUYLER	Look, I have to know. Who's really in charge?
F	CHRISTINE	God?
M	PLYMPTON	What is this, Sky? We got a call from your brother, said there was a surprise party...
F	ELIZABETH	Kind of late for your birthday, isn't it?
F	ELIZABETH	If you wanted to borrow my car, you could've just asked--
M	SCHUYLER	I know, Liz, I've been an idiot, and I'm sorry...
M	PLYMPTON	You OK?
M	SCHUYLER	Yeah-- I'm good, really. Happy to be alive... Listen, it's great to see all of you, thanks for coming-- but there's something I have to do. Excuse me.
M	DAVID	So what's the object of the game?
M	SCHUYLER	What game?
M	DAVID	Very good...
M	SCHUYLER	Is it always like this?
M	DAVID	Mine was a little weirder. Tell you about it sometime.
M	DAVID	The bill. It's itemized. Don't bother opening it now...
M	SCHUYLER	I thought it was a gift.
M	DAVID	Well, no, the card was the gift, the rest was up to you.
M	SCHUYLER	What? Where are we going?
F	CHRISTINE	Does it matter?
