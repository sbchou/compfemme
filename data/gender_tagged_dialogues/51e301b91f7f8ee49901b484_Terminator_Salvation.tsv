M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	PRIEST	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me...
F	SERENA	Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm with Project Angel. You consented to donate your body to science... CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.
F	SERENA	You've been chosen for our research.
M	MARCUS	Chosen? Lucky me.
F	SERENA	We just need a couple of signatures...
M	MARCUS	You don't need to be scared.
F	SERENA	I'm not. It's nerve degeneration.
M	MARCUS	Cancer?
F	SERENA	You're not the only one with a death sentence. What you're doing is important, Marcus. Our work is still highly experimental... but you may be helping people in ways you can't begin to imagine.
M	MARCUS	I'm a regular hero.
F	SERENA	Thank you. And... I'm sorry.
M	MARCUS	No one lives forever.
M	PRIEST (V.O.)	Marcus, this is your last opportunity to make a confession... Is there nothing you would say to Officer Martinez' family?
M	MARCUS (V.O.)	What can I say. I was seventeen, I was angry, I was stupid. CONTINUED: Yeah... I'm sorry about it. I'm sorry about everything. The whole goddamn world... CONTINUED: CONTINUED:
M	TEAM LEADER	Clear!
M	TEAM LEADER	Oh God.
M	TEAM LEADER	You will not believe the shit we found down here-- CONTINUED:
M	PILOT	--repeat, that was not us! A ship escaped, they musta blown the place themselves! Jesus, a lot of our guys were still down there...
M	MARCUS	Hallelujah. CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	Hey! Yo, over here!
M	MARCUS (cont'd)	Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt like I was the last man on... Oh God...
M	BOY	Hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry? CONTINUED:
M	BOY (cont'd)	Whoah, whoah-- hang on there. Got any food? You look like you been eating pretty good.
M	MARCUS	You're human... you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real. I thought I was in hell.
M	BOY	This sure ain't heaven.
M	MARCUS	Those things with masks, red eyes--
M	BOY	Terminators-- T-400s. What is this stuff?
M	MARCUS	If I'm not in hell, where am I?!
M	BOY	Texas!
M	GIRL	Let him go!
M	MARCUS	First put down the shotgun.
M	BOY	Do what he says.
M	GIRL	He'll kill us both!
M	MARCUS	I don't wanna kill anyone.
M	BOY	Do it, Star. Put it down.
M	GIRL	There was only one bullet in that gun.
M	MARCUS	I don't like it when people point guns at me.
M	GIRL	It wasn't loaded.
M	MARCUS	You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun? Pretty stupid.
M	GIRL	Can I have my gun back? Where'd you get those?
M	MARCUS	In the city.
M	BOY	The city? Oh man. That place is red hot.
M	MARCUS	Seemed kinda dead to me.
M	BOY	No-- radiation.
M	BOY (cont'd)	Get down, they've seen the light!
M	MARCUS	That wasn't a helicopter...
M	BOY	It's an H-K-- hunter-killer. Where the hell have you been?
M	GIRL	Rads musta fried his brains. Let's go, Kyle.
M	KYLE	What's your name?
M	MARCUS	Marcus. Marcus Wright.
M	KYLE	Kyle Reese. She doesn't remember her name-- --so I call her Star.
M	KYLE (cont'd)	Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better find cover. We spotted some buildings half a mile that way.
M	KYLE (cont'd)	You can come if you want.
F	STAR	Why? We don't need him.
M	KYLE	I like him. He's funny.
M	MARCUS	What year is it?
F	STAR	Seventeen.
M	KYLE	Nope. Eighteen. CONTINUED:
F	STAR	Are you sure?
M	KYLE	Yup. Two thousand eighteen.
M	MARCUS	Fifteen years... I've lost 15 years. So who did it to us? Terrorists? The Russians, the Chinese--?
F	STAR	Huh?
M	MARCUS	The nukes. There was a war, right? Who started it?
M	KYLE	Something fall on your head? The machines did it, the computers-- they got smart.
F	STAR	Judgment Day... I was just a baby.
M	KYLE	What's the last thing you remember?
M	MARCUS	Dying.
M	KYLE	Eyeball. Only one. CONTINUED:
F	STAR	Now!
M	MARCUS	That flying grapefruit, what was it?
M	KYLE	Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes. They patrol places like this, looking for survivors.
F	STAR	Yes!
M	KYLE	Any red ones? CONTINUED: Mm. Ketchup.
F	STAR	Yuk!
M	MARCUS	Jalape√±o sauce.
F	STAR	You can read.
M	KYLE	So can I. Well, sort of... a little.
F	STAR	Want some?
M	MARCUS	No thanks. Not hungry.
M	KYLE	Never heard anyone say that before. CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	I look the same.
M	KYLE	You ever watch television?
M	MARCUS	Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look forward to in the joint.
F	STAR	What's a joint?
M	MARCUS	Prison. Spent half my life there.
M	KYLE	I remember TV a little. Cartoons. It was great.
M	MARCUS	She your sister?
M	KYLE	Dunno. Been together since we was little. Bunch of us kids was at the day-care center when the bombs fell... she and me are the only ones still around.
M	MARCUS	So this is it? Your life?
M	KYLE	We're gonna find the Resistance, fight for John Connor against Skynet. You oughta join us, you're pretty cool.
M	MARCUS	You don't know me.
M	KYLE	You're strong, you can read... you didn't kill us. Good enough for me...
M	MARCUS	Skynet runs the machines...? So who's this John Connor?
M	KYLE	He's... I don't know. The best. Everybody talks about him. He's the one who's gonna save us.
M	MARCUS	Yeah, right. Him and Jesus.
M	KYLE	Who's Jesus?
M	MARCUS	You're asking the wrong guy.
M	KYLE	So why were you in prison?
M	MARCUS	I killed a cop.
M	KYLE	Were cops like terminators?
M	MARCUS	Well... Nah, some of `em were all right. My little brother Max, pretty wild kid, not much older than you-- he stole a car, just joy-riding, y'know, showing off. Cop chased him right into our front yard, pulled him outta the car... and started whaling on him, kicking the shit out of him. No reason for it, Max was already in cuffs. I ran out of the house, guy tried to pull his gun on me-- guess I just went off on him. Don't even remember it really... they say I broke his neck. Max must be dead too, now... like everybody else.
M	KYLE	You gonna be here when I wake up?
M	MARCUS	Sure.
M	KYLE	Good. Stay away from the windows.
F	STAR	Just me. CONTINUED: Whatcha reading?
M	MARCUS	The bible. My grandma always tried to get me into it, but-- it always put me to sleep. Still does.
F	STAR	Would you read something to me?
M	MARCUS	"...of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh--"
F	STAR	There's a book inside with pictures.
M	MARCUS	"Guaranteed lowest prices... open seven days..."
F	STAR	What's that?
M	MARCUS	It's a flower. A rose.
F	STAR	So... all those numbers... you could call them and get, like, flowers, or someone to come over and fix stuff, or bring you food...
M	MARCUS	Guess people had it pretty good. What else we got... movers, mufflers, music--
F	STAR	Music?
M	MARCUS	You know, pianos, guitars...
F	STAR	I don't remember music.
M	MARCUS	Come on. You must... "I can't get no... satisfaction..." "We are family... I got all my sisters with me..." No, huh. How about... "Twinkle twinkle little star..."
M	MARCUS & STAR	"How I wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky..."
M	MARCUS	You OK?
F	STAR	Somebody used to sing that to me.
M	STAR (cont'd)	Stay with us, Marcus. Please.
M	KYLE	If we get it to move, will you teach me to make it go?
M	MARCUS	It's called driving. Sure.
F	STAR	Wow. What were these like?
M	MARCUS	Not too many around in my time.
F	STAR	Now!
M	MARCUS	Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!
M	KYLE	Aerostat's coming!
F	STAR	Music...
M	MARCUS	Sort of. CONTINUED:
F	STAR	Oh no! It's gonna call a Harvester, we're dead--
M	KYLE	Wow. You're good.
F	STAR	Faster!
M	MARCUS	No! You're doing fine. CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS (cont'd)	Ssh.
M	RADIO VOICE	--proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to diesel fuel. A bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic garbage bag, and will detonate on impact...
M	KYLE	That's him!
M	RADIO VOICE	This recording has described booby- traps and explosive devices. It will repeat every two hours on different frequencies to avoid Skynet jamming...
M	MARCUS	Stop the car.
M	MARCUS (cont'd)	Other pedal, other pedal!
M	RADIO VOICE	Do not give in to despair. As bleak as things seem, I assure you, humanity will triumph. The machines only win when we give up hope... this is John Connor.
M	KYLE	for the day...
M	MARCUS	Damn it. Empty.
M	KYLE	You smell that?
F	STAR	Food!
M	MARCUS	What is this?
M	KYLE	Who cares?
M	MARCUS	Spit it out!
F	STAR	It's good! CONTINUED:
M	COW	Not much meat on `em.
M	PIG	This one's fi-i-ine--
M	MARCUS	Oops.
M	PIG	We didn't kill `em! I swear to God, they was dead already, we wasn't gonna let `em rot--
M	BULL	Go `head, take as much as you want, we're on the same side here-- CONTINUED: CONTINUED: CONTINUED:
M	BLAIR (O.S.)	Yo! Up here! CONTINUED: Who are you--
M	MARCUS	Name's Marcus.
F	BLAIR	You can put me down now, Marcus. I've got an ELT, but I can't call for a rescue here. There's an outpost a few miles upriver-- not my favorite people in the world, but it's safe. Let's move.
M	MARCUS	I'm heading that way.
F	BLAIR	The hot zone? No you're not.
M	MARCUS	I've got to get to my friends--
F	BLAIR	What friends?
M	MARCUS	Couple of kids. They were in that flying dumpster--
F	BLAIR	The Skynet transport? It was carrying people? Christ, we almost shot it down. There've been rumors about a concentration camp, but... You can't get across-- river's fulla hydrobots--
M	MARCUS	Hydrobots?
F	BLAIR	They can't see, but they have killer sonar. They'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will-- heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
M	MARCUS	You're with the Resistance.
F	BLAIR	Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard.
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	Stupid bastards. Come on.
M	MARCUS	I don't know... this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right before they die...
F	BLAIR	That snap you out of it?
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do us all a favor and wake up already.
F	BLAIR	So let me get this straight, Marcus. There you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm... CONTINUED: and the next thing you know, you're here. Since this ain't the resurrection, there's only one possibility.
M	MARCUS	Let's hear it.
F	BLAIR	Whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out. This Angel Project you signed up for-- there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your ass.
M	MARCUS	What the hell for?
F	BLAIR	Drug tests, medical experiments, organ harvesting, who knows? You said you had no family, no friends-- why let a body like yours go to waste?
M	MARCUS	I've never seen trees like these.
F	BLAIR	We're in a mutation zone. I saw a two-headed squirrel here once--
M	MARCUS	Freaky.
F	BLAIR	Tasted like chicken.
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	Levels are tolerable now, but just. We can't spend the night here.
M	MARCUS	What was that?
F	BLAIR	I didn't hear anything--
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	Skindogs.
M	MARCUS	They're surrounding us.
F	BLAIR	They're smart. And they don't scare easy. You saved my ass. Thanks.
M	MARCUS	Dog eat dog world.
F	BLAIR	Thanks.
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	It's not far, but we'll never get across the mine field at night. Might as well STAF till morning.
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite.
M	MARCUS	Staf? What's that mean? CONTINUED:
F	BLAIR	It's a resistance term. Sit tight and fuck. You holding out for lipstick? Lingerie? Or am I not your... type?
M	MARCUS	I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss-- women all the time. But now... it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice...
F	BLAIR	Maybe it's just gonna take some time. Before you're completely thawed out. What are these?
M	MARCUS	I dunno. They just... sorta reminded me of her.
F	BLAIR	Who?
M	MARCUS	There's a woman, the last woman I saw before... when I was under, the dead time-- she kept coming to me. I think she must've saved me.
F	BLAIR	I can't compete with that.
M	KYLE	We've landed. CONTINUED:
F	STAR	What's going to happen to us?
M	KYLE	I don't know...
M	MARCUS	We're in somebody's garden.
F	BLAIR	Christ... there's supposed to be barbed wire along the edge.
M	MARCUS	Over there. CONTINUED:
F	BLAIR	Whatever you do, don't move. Yo! Morrison, Barnes! Can anybody hear me?! We're in the middle of the mine field.
M	BARNES	Somebody feed those things!
M	MORRISON	Start up the generator, Barnes.
F	LISA	We got company! CONTINUED:
M	BARNES	Blair? Good to see you. What's the password?
F	BLAIR	Eat shit and die, Barnes!
M	BARNES	Close enough. Who's your friend?
F	BLAIR	Could you get us outta here please?
M	BARNES	Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in a mine field.
F	BLAIR	You didn't maintain the perimeter! Where are your sentries?
M	BARNES	It's too early for that military crap.
M	BARNES (cont'd)	OK, if you keep walking straight you're gonna get blown all to hell... turn to your left and take, oh... five steps. OK, face me now. Three steps. CONTINUED: Almost home. Turn to your right and take another five steps...
F	BLAIR	You goddamn idiot!
M	BARNES	He was takin' bigger steps!
M	MORRISON	Son of a bitch is heavy.
M	JANE	He stepped on a Claymore? This guy oughta be in a hundred pieces... CONTINUED:
F	BLAIR	What are you doing?
M	JANE	Does he have a prosthetic limb?
F	BLAIR	I don't think so.
M	JANE	This is not skin... oh Jesus-- oh God--
M	JANE (cont'd)	He's a terminator.
F	SERENA	Why isn't he conscious? Something's wrong, he should be coming out of it by now...
M	MARCUS	Boo!
M	JANE	Thermoplastic skin, some larger hydraulics, but mostly titanium microgears... This looks like some sort of aeration and hydration system, function unclear at this point. Valves and what looks like an access panel below the ribcage... CONTINUED:
M	JANE (cont'd)	Eyes are polymer optics, very lifelike. Lead shielding all around the skull, presumably to protect the CPU.
F	BLAIR	Whatever he is-- he's on our side--
M	MORRISON	How can he be?
F	BLAIR	He saved my life!
M	MORRISON	Winning your trust would aid his infiltration.
F	LISA	Regional doesn't know what to do. They're gonna patch us through to Command Los Angeles.
M	NANCY	How could you bring this monster here?! This is our home! Our children--
F	BLAIR	What do you want from me-- I didn't know!
M	KID	It's awake!
M	MARCUS	Get me the hell down from here!
M	BARNES	Shut up! I told you to shut up!
F	BLAIR	Leave him alone! Marcus, I'm so sorry...
M	BARNES	It keeps talkin' at me. God this thing gives me the creeps.
M	MARCUS	Why are you doing this? What is this place?
M	MORRISON	We're trying to--
M	NANCY	Don't say anything! It's probably uplinked to Skynet.
M	MORRISON	Then it's already too late. This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from? CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	Corpus Christi. It's in Texas. Or it was.
M	BARNES	It sounds completely human... it really could pass.
M	JANE	Didn't John Connor say they'd start building things like this?
M	MORRISON	Not yet-- not for years. So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history--
M	MARCUS	What are you talking about?
M	MORRISON	You can skip the act, we know what you are.
M	NANCY	Why are you even speaking to it?!
M	BARNES	She's right, let's just waste the damn thing--
M	NANCY	It'll kill us all if we give it a CHANCE--
M	MARCUS	I'm a man! Even if I never been treated like one. Year after year after year on death row, I just wanted it to end! I cut my own wrists. But they nursed me back to health, `cause that wouldn't be fair, they needed to kill me themselves. For Chrissake, you all want me dead so bad-- just do it. Do it!
F	LISA	Regional got through to CLA-- they want us to rig a video feed. He wants to see him.
M	MORRISON	Who does?
F	LISA	John Connor.
M	MARCUS	So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it? CONTINUED:
M	MORRISON	John Connor founded the Resistance. When the war began, no one even knew who the enemy was-- Connor taught us how to fight back. He saved humanity.
M	MARCUS	Yeah, well, humanity's never done all that much for me. Why can't I see him?
M	MORRISON	Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be allowed to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret.
M	CONNOR'S VOICE	--hello-- standing by--
F	LISA	Sir, we can hear you, sir, working on a visual, sir...
F	CONNOR	Not what I expected... CONTINUED:
M	CONNOR'S VOICE	It does seem lifelike-- is the face able to mimic emotions--?
M	MARCUS	This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do you want from me?
F	CONNOR	I-- I need to know what you are.
M	MARCUS	So do I! I don't know what I am, what I'm doing here, I don't know shit-- maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it! Just blow my head off or let me go.
F	CONNOR	This isn't right. I can't be having a conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn't that sophisticated yet. Unless... were you sent here from the future?
M	MARCUS	What?
F	CONNOR	Skynet's developing a time displacement field, we've decrypted recent data transmissions. I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades. To try and stop us from winning this war before it begins...
M	MARCUS	You're out of your mind, aren't you?
M	CONNOR'S VOICE	Jesus... I've seen enough. Stand by for further instructions.
F	KATE	He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton.
F	CONNOR	Besides, the first T-800s won't be manufactured until `26.
M	ADVISOR #1	Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment.
M	ADVISOR #2	Let's hope. If there are more out there like him, we're in serious trouble. Christ, a terminator with attitude...
F	KATE	Where did they find him?
M	ADVISOR #1	East-central Texas, near an area of heavy Skynet concentration. The outpost where they're holding him is reasonably secure, but it's not much more than a commune.
F	CONNOR	I want him extracted.
M	ADVISOR #1	Done. What then? CONTINUED:
F	CONNOR	Get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick. We need to get into that metal skull, crack his CPU at all costs. Kate, why did I become leader of the Resistance?
F	KATE	Because people trust you... you give them faith--
F	CONNOR	No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother-- even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die...
F	KATE	JOHN--
F	CONNOR	So how could I not know about this?! CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me?
M	MORRISON	Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.
M	KYLE	We're stopping. CONTINUED:
F	STAR	I'm scared.
M	KYLE	Whatever happens, we stick together. CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	Hello? Anyone there? I'm thirsty.
M	BARNES	Want some motor oil?
M	MARCUS	I need water.
M	BARNES	Bullshit. Machines don't drink.
M	MARCUS	Please, I'm--
M	BARNES	Shut up, robot!
F	BLAIR	How's it going, Barnes? Thought you might like a late-night snack. CONTINUED:
M	BARNES	Where in hell'd you get these?
F	BLAIR	We got a stash back at the base.
M	BARNES	Kinda stale.
F	BLAIR	You need something to wash it down.
M	BARNES	I'm on duty, you know.
M	BARNES (cont'd)	Twinkies and moonshine. You trying to seduce me again?
F	BLAIR	You know I always liked you, Barnes. I just didn't want to join the harem.
M	BARNES	What can I say? It's our duty to repopulate the planet.
F	BLAIR	Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
M	BARNES	C'mere.
F	BLAIR	I prefer a little privacy.
M	BARNES	You're so twentieth century...
M	BARNES (cont'd)	Admit it, I'm the best you ever had...
F	BLAIR	Men. You're all talk.
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	I used up the last of my Valium for you... Hold out your arms.
M	MARCUS	Why are you doing this?
F	BLAIR	I don't believe you're a terminator.
M	MARCUS	So what am I...?
F	BLAIR	Whatever you are-- I owe you one. Once you're free, I'll lie down next to Barnes-- they'll assume you escaped while we were passed out--
M	MARCUS	You think they'll buy that?
F	BLAIR	Worth a shot. Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive-- and you've got a right to live.
F	BLAIR	They're already here for you-- Hide in the forest, then aim west for open country--
M	MARCUS	I'm heading across the river.
F	BLAIR	No human being can survive there-- CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	I'm not human, remember?
F	BLAIR	You're gonna try and save those kids.
M	MARCUS	It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense...
F	BLAIR	Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already--
M	MARCUS	For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead.
F	BLAIR	Damn it, we're too late--
M	MARCUS	Where's that go?
F	BLAIR	Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan--
F	BLAIR	Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance.
M	MARCUS	Thank you. CONTINUED: CONTINUED: CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	Don't mention it. CONTINUED: CONTINUED: CONTINUED: CONTINUED:
F	CONNOR	I need to talk to the prisoner.
F	CONNOR	Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry about the way you've been treated, but we're forced to take every precaution. I'm John Connor.
F	BLAIR	Sir.
F	CONNOR	At ease. Please, sit. CONTINUED:
M	CONNOR (cont'd)	I've gone over your record, lieutenant. You're a good soldier, flown a lot of missions... Why in God's name would you help a terminator escape?
F	BLAIR	Sir-- he isn't a terminator. He's human.
F	CONNOR	We know he's crossed into Skynet territory, why would he do that if he isn't--
F	BLAIR	He's trying to find his friends.
F	CONNOR	What friends?
F	BLAIR	A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet transport, probably to some kind of prison camp-- he said their names were Star and Kyle.
F	CONNOR	Kyle.
F	BLAIR	Mm... Kyle something. With an `R.'
F	CONNOR	Reese.
F	BLAIR	That's it. How did you...?
F	KATE	What is it, John?
F	CONNOR	I always knew I'd have to find him someday. I just didn't know how.
F	KATE	What? Find who?
F	CONNOR	My father.
M	KYLE AND STAR	Twinkle, twinkle, little star... CONTINUED:
F	STAR	Oh no, oh no...
M	KYLE	Shh, keep singing.
F	STAR	Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky...
M	KYLE	Stop it stop it STOP IT! CONTINUED: CONTINUED:
M	JEREMY	Are you all right?
M	MARCUS	What the hell is this?
M	JEREMY	You look like you've been hit by a truck--
M	MARCUS	Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings--
M	JEREMY	The facility, sure. Hop in, I'll take you there. This round was gonna blow my handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy.
M	MARCUS	Marcus.
M	JEREMY	I can't connect with you at all... your interface must've been damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll have you as good as new.
M	MARCUS	I didn't think there was-- anything like this left... anywhere.
M	JEREMY	Yes. We're very lucky. Want some?
M	MARCUS	This isn't food.
M	JEREMY	Well, of course not. Seems you got a little memory loss going on. It's a foam resin. It can taste like anything you want it to-- but of course, we don't really need to eat. Our brains are powered by fuel cells, remember? CONTINUED: We're in a transitional phase. Most of us need the comfort of the familiar a little while longer-- food, shelter, sex. Until we forget the old life. Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of the hardest habits to break... but before long, none of this will be necessary. We won't even need these bodies.
M	MARCUS	Terminators!
M	JEREMY	We don't call them that here.
M	MARCUS	What are you?
M	JEREMY	A hybrid. The same as you.
M	MARCUS	A hybrid-- human and machine?
M	JEREMY	Of course. That's what this community is for-- people like us.
M	MARCUS	Jesus... why?
M	JEREMY	You should be grateful to have been chosen.
M	MARCUS	What about the ones who weren't?
M	JEREMY	You mean like Janet and the kids.
M	MARCUS	Your family. You lost them?
M	MARCUS (cont'd)	Why are you smiling?
M	JEREMY	`Cause I feel good. The interface recognizes negative emotions-- rage, grief, despair-- and stimulates positive endorphins in response. Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think? CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	Tell me everything. How did you people get here?
M	JEREMY	Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA. I was an engineer on Project Angel--
M	MARCUS	Angel-- what is it?
M	JEREMY	Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me, it's not like I need to breathe. We replaced the body's hydrocarbons with plastinated compounds while maintaining cellular structure-- analog neural impulses were converted to wireless digital signals, controlling the micro-tech chassis--
M	MARCUS	English!
M	JEREMY	The goal was a superior support system for the human brain-- to go anywhere, do anything-- explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics. The facility is just ahead. I'll let them know you're coming. CONTINUED:
M	ENGINEER	32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no, insufficient neural capacity. 32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have even been brought here... 32581 looks good... 32582... hm, borderline. May not be emotionally compatible. Pass.
F	SERENA	Marcus! CONTINUED: Marcus... it is you. You're alive, you found us. Welcome to paradise.
M	MARCUS	It's a graveyard.
F	SERENA	There was no choice-- the old civilization had to be eliminated. To make way for a new world... a world without death or suffering.
M	SERENA (cont'd)	You were the first... I'm sorry.
M	SERENA (cont'd)	We should never have left you behind. CONTINUED:
M	AIDE	Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you, but you said you wanted to know immediately--
F	CONNOR	What is it?
M	AIDE	We found our terminator.
M	AIR FORCE OFFICER	The signal's coming from near what used to be Galveston, right on the coast.
M	NAVAL OFFICER	There can't be any prisoners there. The whole area's a nuclear wasteland-- only machines can survive the radiation levels for any length of time.
F	CONNOR	Mobilize a combined air and naval assault, all available resources. We're sending in a rescue team ASAP.
F	KATE	All to find one teenage boy...? John, you really think this can work? CONTINUED:
F	CONNOR	I'm standing here, I exist-- so it must have worked. We will find him.
M	CONNOR (cont'd)	Call it an act of faith.
F	SERENA	Calm down, Marcus. It's all right.
M	MARCUS	Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?! CONTINUED:
F	SERENA	Repairing you.
M	MARCUS	You all work for Skynet!
F	SERENA	Please. Skynet works for us. It's only a program-- a tool, a means to an end.
M	MARCUS	The end of the world.
F	SERENA	Its sole purpose is to protect humanity.
M	SERENA (cont'd)	Listen to me. Skynet was designed to detect threats, make projections and implement solutions. As soon as it came on line, it factored in war, disease, environmental destruction-- and calculated a high probability of total human extinction within two hundred years. The human race was doomed... unless we were transformed.
M	MARCUS	Into-- this? A brain in a box?
F	SERENA	Skynet had access to the entire defense web-- including Project Angel. It determined hybrids were the only path to salvation.
M	MARCUS	Destroying the human race in order to save it. What are you doing?
F	SERENA	When the resistance attacked our installation, we were forced to self-destruct. We would have taken you with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma... Your interface was never installed.
M	MARCUS	No, stop... I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you!
F	SERENA	We're immortal. No sane person would choose to live in pain, forever. Soon you'll understand. CONTINUED:
F	SERENA	How are you feeling, Marcus?
M	MARCUS	I'm not sure I know how to describe it.
F	SERENA	It's called happiness. You've been angry all your life. You don't know what it's like to feel... a part of something.
F	SERENA	Pure ecstasy... we can share in it together.
M	MARCUS	When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven... it always sounded so boring.
F	SERENA	Were you bored just now? CONTINUED: That sensation is always there for you, whenever you desire. But most of us here are scientists... our greatest joy is using our minds to explore, to discover... I'll show you.
F	SERENA	Nanotechnology, polymimetic metals... working with Skynet, we're making amazing breakthroughs, well beyond anything possible before Judgment Day.
F	SERENA	We've already freed ourselves from biological limits... soon we'll transcend the laws of physics. CONTINUED: Right now, we can only go back a few days at most...
M	MARCUS	A time machine... Connor was right.
F	SERENA	The Resistance leader? You know him?
M	MARCUS	...I've just heard him speak.
F	SERENA	He's a dangerous man. Delusional. He thinks he's a savior, but all he's really fighting for is... death.
M	MARCUS	In the world outside-- the survivors think Skynet is the enemy, out to destroy them. Why don't you tell them about all this?
F	SERENA	Not everyone can become like us, Marcus. We just don't have the resources to sustain more than a few thousand hybrids.
M	MARCUS	Then why... Some people I knew were picked up, taken here...
F	SERENA	A boy and a girl-- in the last day or two?
M	MARCUS	Yes... what is this place?
F	SERENA	Part of the neural net-- human minds linked directly with artificial intelligence. The processing power of the human brain is still beyond anything Skynet can manufacture.
M	SERENA (cont'd)	Display recent arrivals for processing. Next page...
M	MARCUS	That's them. CONTINUED:
F	SERENA	Good news. He'll soon be part of the network-- you'll be able to connect with him.
M	SERENA (cont'd)	I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus. She didn't suffer.
M	MARCUS	Of course. I... I understand. What is it?
F	SERENA	I don't know-- I have to go. Will you be all right? Of course you will.
M	MARCUS	I need to go back!
M	PHYSICIST	now it's oscillating between three and six hours--
M	MARCUS	What do I do?
M	PHYSICIST	Just breach the sphere. But you could materialize anywhere in a mile radius-- CONTINUED: No, don't shoot in here--! Idiots.
M	ENGINEER	32581 looks good... 32582... hm, borderline. May not be emotionally compatible. Pass.
M	MARCUS	Let them go.
M	ENGINEER	What? Who are you?
M	MARCUS	I said, let them go! CONTINUED:
M	ENGINEER	You can't hurt me.
M	MARCUS	Now you're pissing me off. How'd that feel? I pull this off and you'll be in a world of pain!
M	MARCUS (cont'd)	Last chance. Let them out. I'm gonna need your clothes.
M	KYLE	No!
F	STAR	What?
M	KYLE	Marcus!
F	STAR	I knew you'd come.
M	MARCUS	We've gotta get out of here.
M	MARCUS	Stay down! CONTINUED: It's OK, I'm not human! You can't drive!
M	KYLE	Watch me! CONTINUED:
F	STAR	That looked like--
M	MARCUS	I know. Long story.
M	MARCUS (cont'd)	Take that path!
M	MARCUS	The trees! CONTINUED: You two all right?
F	STAR	Why don't you drive?
M	KYLE	Come on I was doing good! CONTINUED:
M	KYLE	Where are we going?
M	MARCUS	There. CONTINUED:
M	KYLE	He's not real. CONTINUED:
F	STAR	Don't come any closer!
M	MARCUS	I'm sorry. CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	There are more prisoners, a complex about a mile in--
M	HAZ-MAT MAN	What's your name, son?
M	KYLE	Kyle Reese.
F	CONNOR	John Connor. I'm glad you made it.
M	CONNOR (cont'd)	Seems I owe you an apology.
M	MARCUS	Yeah, well. Get in line.
M	DOCTOR	Does this hurt?
M	MARCUS	I don't feel a thing. Help somebody else.
F	KATE	Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.
F	CONNOR	The last boatload is right behind me. Skynet's pouring in reinforcements, we can't hold this place. And the people in the houses, they won't leave--
M	MARCUS	They're not people anymore...
M	MARCUS (cont'd)	No! CONTINUED:
F	SERENA	Why, Marcus? You were immortal...
M	MARCUS	No one lives forever.
F	CONNOR	This... this can't happen...
F	BLAIR	Marcus... I need to head back to my unit.
M	BLAIR (cont'd)	What about you?
M	MARCUS	I have no idea. I should be dead...
F	STAR	But you're alive. CONTINUED:
M	MARCUS	So to speak.
F	BLAIR	We've been ordered not to talk about it-- the hybrids, everything about that place is top secret...
M	MARCUS	Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus machine.
F	STAR	What did it feel like? To be... one of them?
M	MARCUS	Better than anything. Everything made sense. For the first time in my life, I felt... right. It was heaven.
F	BLAIR	How could you give that up?
M	MARCUS	I never really believed in heaven.
F	BLAIR	Here. You need these more than I do.
F	KATE	He wants to see you.
F	CONNOR	Her name was Sarah... she was... amazing...
M	KYLE	I don't remember my mother.
F	CONNOR	Keep it.
F	KATE	Kyle, could you give us a minute? Marcus... you're going to need to be rebuilt. Your face, your body, your voice... We have people who can do it.
M	KATE (cont'd)	But you won't be the same... CONTINUED:
M	KATE (cont'd)	The scar will help hide the change.
M	MARCUS	You're asking me to become... Him?
F	CONNOR	You must. We can't keep him alive much longer. Very few people know what John actually looks like. Only the technicians and our closest advisors need ever know the truth.
M	MARCUS	Why me?
F	KATE	Who else? Only you know the enemy from the inside. You liberated a Skynet camp... you're a hero.
F	CONNOR	I never knew how I was supposed to win this war. But I finally understand: the idea of John Connor is more important than the person. I can die. He cannot. Please. We need you.
M	MARCUS (V.O.)	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ...I shall fear no evil...
M	MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)	I died, and was reborn. I wear another man's face, lead another man's life... yet only now do I have a reason for living. I once was lost, but now I'm found... ...was blind, but now I see. CONTINUED:
