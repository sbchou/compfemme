M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
F	DOROTHY	She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on - - we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	Aunt Em! Aunt Em!
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	Aunt Em!
M	AUNT EM	Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
F	DOROTHY	Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
M	AUNT EM	Dorothy, please! We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
F	DOROTHY	Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
M	UNCLE HENRY	Don't bother us now, honey -- this old incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh, but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day.
M	AUNT EM	Seventy -- Dorothy, please!
F	DOROTHY	Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
M	AUNT EM	Dorothy! Dorothy! We're busy!
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- all right.
M	UNCLE HENRY	Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
M	AUNT EM	I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
M	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
M	AUNT EM	Oh, I hope we got them in time.
M	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
M	ZEKE	How's she coming? Take it easy. Ow! You got my finger! CS -- Zeke and Hickory holding wagon bed --
M	ZEKE	Well, why don't you get your finger out of the way!
M	HICKORY	Come on - come on - over this way.
M	ZEKE	Okay.
M	HICKORY	There you are.
M	HUNK	Right on my finger!
M	ZEKE	It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.
F	DOROTHY	Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old cat --
M	ZEKE	Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.
M	HUNK	Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't have any brains at all.
F	DOROTHY	I have so got brains. Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See?
F	DOROTHY	Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
M	HUNK	Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
M	HICKORY	Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
F	DOROTHY	Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
M	HICKORY	Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
F	DOROTHY	This?
M	HICKORY	Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
F	DOROTHY	Oh!
M	HICKORY	Who did it? Now wait a minute.
F	DOROTHY	Hickory!
M	HICKORY	Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
M	ZEKE	Say! Get in there before I make a dime bank out of you! Listen, kid, are you going to let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?
M	ZEKE (CONT'D)	She ain't nothing to be afraid of. Have a little courage, that's all.
F	DOROTHY	I'm not afraid of her.
M	ZEKE	Then the next time she squawks, walk right up to her and spit in her eye. That's what I'd do!
F	DOROTHY	Oh! Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here! Help!
M	HICKORY	Are you all right, Dorothy?
F	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm all right. Oh -- I fell in and - - and Zeke --
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
M	HUNK	What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
M	HICKORY	Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white
M	AUNT EM	Here, here, what's all this jabber- wapping when there's work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
M	HICKORY	Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
M	AUNT EM	I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
M	HICKORY	All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and -- Well, don't start posing for it now. Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
M	HUNK	Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
M	AUNT EM	Just fried.
M	HICKORY	Thanks.
M	HUNK	Swell.
M	ZEKE	You see, Dorothy toppled in with the big Duroc...
M	AUNT EM	It's no place for Dorothy about a pig sty! Now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!
M	ZEKE	Yes'am.
F	DOROTHY	Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She said she was gonna --
M	AUNT EM	Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
F	DOROTHY	No --
M	AUNT EM	Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
F	DOROTHY	Some place where there isn't any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away -- behind the moon -- beyond the rain --
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	...Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow, Why then -
M	MISS GULCH	Mr. Gale!
M	UNCLE HENRY	Howdy, Miss Gulch.
M	MISS GULCH	I want to see you and your wife right away.... ... about Dorothy.
M	UNCLE HENRY	Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
M	MISS GULCH	What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
M	UNCLE HENRY	You mean she bit you?
M	MISS GULCH	No, her dog!
M	UNCLE HENRY	Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
M	MISS GULCH	NO! That dog's a menace to the community. I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
F	DOROTHY	Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
M	UNCLE HENRY	Of course we won't. Will we, Em?
F	DOROTHY	Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean to. He didn't know he was doing anything wrong. I'm the one that ought to be punished. I let him go in her garden. You can send me to bed without supper --
M	MISS GULCH	If you don't hand over that dog, I'll bring a damage suit that'll take your whole farm! There's a law protecting folks against dogs that bite!
M	AUNT EM	How would it be if she keeps him tied up? He's really gentle -- with gentle people, that is.
M	MISS GULCH	Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide. Here's his order allowing me to take him. Unless you want to go against the law.
M	UNCLE HENRY	Uhh -- yeah --
M	AUNT EM	Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
M	MISS GULCH	Now you're seeing reason.
F	DOROTHY	No --
M	MISS GULCH	Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
M	AUNT EM	Dorothy!
F	DOROTHY	You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto! Don't let her take him -- please!
M	MISS GULCH	Here! I've got an order! Let me have...
F	DOROTHY	Stop her!
M	AUNT EM	Put him in the basket, Henry.
M	MISS GULCH	The idea!
F	DOROTHY	Oh, don't, Uncle Henry. Oh, Toto! Don't...
M	AUNT EM	Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean you have the power to run the rest of us! For twenty- three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now -- well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it!
F	DOROTHY	Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back! You came back! Oh, I'm so glad! Toto! Oh, they'll be coming back for you in a minute. We've got to get away! We've got to run away -- quick! The CROWNED HEADS of EUROPE Let Him In His
M	PROFESSOR	Well, well, well -- house guests, huh? And who might you be? No, no -- now don't tell me. Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right. I -- you're -- you're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
F	DOROTHY	How did you guess?
M	PROFESSOR	Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
F	DOROTHY	Why --
M	PROFESSOR	No, no -- now don't tell me. They -- they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
F	DOROTHY	Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
M	PROFESSOR	Yes --
F	DOROTHY	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you? ...polite! We haven't been asked yet.
M	PROFESSOR	He's perfectly welcome. As one dog to another, huh? Here now -- let's see where were we? Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
F	DOROTHY	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
M	PROFESSOR	Oh --
F	DOROTHY	Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
M	PROFESSOR	Aw, come, come, come --
F	DOROTHY	No, they won't - honestly.
M	PROFESSOR	Oh --
F	DOROTHY	Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
M	PROFESSOR	Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing - - Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's.... ...go inside here -- we'll -- Just come along. I'll show you. There you are - right in there. That's right. Here -- sit right down here. That's it. Ha ha! This -- this is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal used by the Priests of Isis and Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs of Egypt -- in which Cleopatra first saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony, and -- and so on -- and so on. Now, you -- you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment -- in order to be better in tune with the infinite. We -- we can't do these things without.... ...infinite. Yes. That's -- that's all right. Now you can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal. Ahh -- what's this I see? A house -- with a picket fence.... ...and a barn -- with a weather vane and a -- of a -- of a running horse.
M	PROFESSOR (CONT'D)	No - it's - it's - a crowing rooster.
F	DOROTHY	That's our farm!
M	PROFESSOR	Oh -- yes.
M	PROFESSOR (CONT'D)	Yes, there's -- there's a woman -- she's.... INSERT -- CU of the photograph -
M	PROFESSOR (CONT'D)	...she's wearing a polka-dot dress.... ...her face is careworn.
F	DOROTHY	Yes...That's Aunt Em.
M	PROFESSOR	Her -- her name is Emily.
F	DOROTHY	That's right. What's she doing?
M	PROFESSOR	Well, I -- I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.
F	DOROTHY	Oh --
M	PROFESSOR	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
F	DOROTHY	Me?
M	PROFESSOR	Well, it's -- it's someone she loves very much. Someone she's been very kind to. Someone she's taken care of in sickness.
F	DOROTHY	I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
M	PROFESSOR	Uh-huh.
F	DOROTHY	What's she doing now?
M	PROFESSOR	Well, she's - she's going into a little bed.... CU - Dorothy - Camera shooting past Professor -
M	PROFESSOR (CONT'D)	...room --
F	DOROTHY	Has it poppies on the wall.... MCU - ...paper?
M	PROFESSOR	I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this? Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the.... ...bed.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- no!
M	PROFESSOR	That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, you.... ...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
M	PROFESSOR	But -- what's this? I thought you were going along with me.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right.... ...away! Come on, Toto! Oh, what'll I do? If we go home, they'll send you to the Sheriff. And if we don't, Aunt Em may -- well, she may die! I know what I'll do - I'll give you to Hunk. He'll watch out for you. But we've got to hurry. Goodbye, Professor Marvel -- and thanks a lot!
M	PROFESSOR	Better get under cover, Sylvester -- there's a storm blowing up -- a whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry. Poor little kid -- I hope she gets home all right.
M	UNCLE HENRY	Hunk, get them horses loose! Where's Hickory. Hickory! Hickory! Doggone it! Hick -- Hey, what are you doing there?
M	HICKORY	This is my chance! The cyclone is coming. Let me show you what my machine can do! You see, it goes --
M	UNCLE HENRY	Doggone you! Help Hunk get them horses loose!
M	HICKORY	All right - you'll be sorry.
M	UNCLE HENRY	Go on, hurry up! Hurry up, I tell you! She's here -- it's a twister! ELS -- The Gale Farm -- Cyclone approaching --
M	AUNT EM	Dorothy! Dorothy!
M	UNCLE HENRY	Come on -- everybody in the storm cellar!
M	AUNT EM	Henry! Henry! I can't find Dorothy! She's somewhere out in the storm! Dorothy!
F	DOROTHY	Auntie Em! Auntie Em!
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	We're not on the ground, Toto!
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	We must be up inside.... MCS -- Toto looks out from under bed -- DOROTHY o.s. Toto -- I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. We must be over the rainbow!
M	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	Now I -- I know we're not in Kansas.
F	GLINDA	Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
F	DOROTHY	Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas. Oh! Well....
F	DOROTHY	Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.
F	GLINDA	Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
M	GLINDA (CONT'D)	...is, are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
F	DOROTHY	Oh, but I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly. What was that?
F	GLINDA	The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North. You are! Oh, I beg your pardon! But I've never heard of a beautiful.... MCU -- Glinda looks to r.f.g. and speaks -- DOROTHY o.s.
F	GLINDA	Only bad witches are ugly.
M	GLINDA (CONT'D)	The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
F	DOROTHY	Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
F	GLINDA	The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out. Come out, come out, wherever you are And meet the young lady who fell from a star.
M	GLINDA (CONT'D)	She fell from the sky, she fell very far. And Kansas she says is the name of the star.
M	MUNCHKINS	Kansas she says is the name of the star.
F	GLINDA	She brings you good news. Or haven't you heard?
F	DOROTHY	It really was no miracle. What happened was just this:
M	A MUNCHKIN	And oh, what happened then was rich!
M	SEVERAL MUNCHKINS	The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch
M	MUNCHKINS	It landed on the Wicked Witch In the middle of a ditch Which was not a healthy situation For the Wicked Witch.
M	MUNCHKINS (CONT'D)	The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch It landed on the Wicked Witch in the middle of a ditch ....sitch-
M	MUNCHKINS (CONT'D)	...The Wicked.... ...Witch!
F	GLINDA	The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

M	MUNCHKINS	Tra la la la la
F	DOROTHY	I thought you said she was dead.
F	GLINDA	That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West. And she's worse than the other one was.
M	WITCH	Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
F	GLINDA	Leave her alone!
M	WITCH	You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,.... ...didn't you?
F	DOROTHY	No -- No! It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
M	WITCH	Didn't mean it, eh? Accident, eh? Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too -- and this is how I do it! GLINDA o.s.
F	GLINDA	...ting the ruby slippers?
M	WITCH	The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
M	WITCH (CONT'D)	They're gone!
M	WITCH (CONT'D)	The ruby slippers! What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll - It's too late! There they....
F	DOROTHY	Oh!
M	WITCH	I'm the only one that knows how to use them. They're of no use to you! Give them back to me!
F	GLINDA	Keep tight inside of them -- their magic must be very powerful, or she wouldn't want them so badly!
M	WITCH	You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
F	GLINDA	Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
M	WITCH	Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way.... MCU -- Witch threatens Dorothy o.s. in f.g. --
M	WITCH	... -- just try! I'll get you, my....
F	GLINDA	It's all right. You can get up -- she's gone.
F	GLINDA	It's all right. You can all get up.
F	GLINDA	Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur! I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came.
F	GLINDA	No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
F	DOROTHY	The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
F	GLINDA	Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
F	DOROTHY	No, I'm afraid I didn't.
F	GLINDA	Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
F	DOROTHY	But, how do I start for Emerald City?
F	GLINDA	It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
F	DOROTHY	But -- what happens if I --- CS -- Glinda speaks to Dorothy o.s. in f.g. --
F	GLINDA	Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.
F	DOROTHY	My -- ! People come and go so quickly here! Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
M	MAYOR	Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
M	1ST MUNCHKIN	Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
M	WOMAN	Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
M	BARRISTER	Follow the Yellow Brick Road.
M	FIDDLERS	Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow, follow, follow, follow, Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow the Yellow Brick Follow the...
M	FIDDLERS	...Yellow Brick
M	FIDDLERS	You're off to see the Wizard The Wonderful Wizard of Oz!
F	DOROTHY	Follow the Yellow Brick Road? Follow the Yellow....? Now which way do we go?
M	SCARECROW	That way is a very nice way. CS -- Scarecrow, his arm pointing to right --
F	DOROTHY	Who said that?
F	DOROTHY	Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows....
F	DOROTHY	...don't talk.
M	SCARECROW	It's pleasant down that way, too.
F	DOROTHY	That's funny. Wasn't he pointing the other way?
M	SCARECROW	...go both ways!
F	DOROTHY	Why....
F	DOROTHY	...you did say something, didn't you? CS- The Scarecrow shakes his head, then nods -
F	DOROTHY	Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?
M	SCARECROW	That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind. I haven't got a brain -- only straw.
F	DOROTHY	How can you talk if you haven't got a.... MCU -- Scarecrow speaks to Dorothy o.s.in f.g. -- DOROTHY o.s.
M	SCARECROW	I don't know. But some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, don't they?
F	DOROTHY	Yes, I guess you're right.
F	DOROTHY	Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?
M	SCARECROW	Why, no.
F	DOROTHY	How do you do?
M	SCARECROW	How do you do?
F	DOROTHY	Very well, thank you.
M	SCARECROW	Oh, I'm not feeling at all well. You see, it's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back. MCU -- Dorothy --
F	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?
M	SCARECROW	Down? No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
F	DOROTHY	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
M	SCARECROW	Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
F	DOROTHY	Well, oh, dear -- I don't quite see....
M	SCARECROW	Of course, I'm not bright about doing things, but if you'll just....
F	DOROTHY	Oh....
F	DOROTHY	...yes.
M	SCARECROW	Ohhhh --
F	DOROTHY	Ohh!
M	SCARECROW	Whhhooops! Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- does it hurt you?
M	SCARECROW	Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
F	DOROTHY	Ohhh --
M	SCARECROW	My, it's good to be....
M	SCARECROW	...free!
F	DOROTHY	Oh! Oh! Ohhh!
M	SCARECROW	Did I scare you?
F	DOROTHY	No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
M	SCARECROW	But I didn't scare you?
F	DOROTHY	No -- of course not.
M	SCARECROW	I didn't think so.
M	SCARECROW	Boo! You see, I can't even scare a crow! They come from miles.... MCU -- Dorothy
M	SCARECROW	Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain.
F	DOROTHY	Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?
M	SCARECROW	Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could -- I could while away the hours, Conferrin' with the flowers, Consultin' with the rain. And my head I'd be scratchin' While my thoughts were busy hatchin' If I only had a brain. I'd unravel every riddle For any individ'le
F	DOROTHY	With the thoughts you'll be thinkin' You could be another Lincoln If you only had a brain.
M	SCARECROW	Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore I could think of things I never thunk before,
M	SCARECROW	...Life would be a ding-a-derry If I only had a brain!
M	SCARECROW	Gosh, it would be awful pleasin' To reason out the reason For things I can't explain. Then perhaps I'll deserve you, And be even worthy erv you If I only had a brain.
F	DOROTHY	Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
M	SCARECROW	They would?
F	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
M	SCARECROW	Where's Kansas?
F	DOROTHY	That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
M	SCARECROW	You're going to see a Wizard?
F	DOROTHY	Um-hmm. Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
F	DOROTHY	I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
M	SCARECROW	Yes -- that's true.
F	DOROTHY	But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
M	SCARECROW	Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
F	DOROTHY	I don't blame you for that.
M	SCARECROW	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look - - I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?
F	DOROTHY	Why, of course I will!
M	SCARECROW	Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
M	SCARECROW	Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.

M	TIN MAN	When a man's an empty kettle, He should be on his mettle. And yet I'm torn apart. Just because I'm presumin' That I could be kind-a human, If I only had a heart.
M	TIN MAN	I'd be tender -- I'd be gentle And awful sentimental Regarding Love and Art I'd be friends with sparrows...
M	TIN MAN	...And the boy who shoots the arrows If I only had a heart. Picture me....a balcony....Above a voice sings low.
M	TIN MAN	I hear a beat....how sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy -- Devotion -- And really feel the part, I could stay young and chipper, And I'd lock it with a zipper, If I only had a heart...!
F	DOROTHY	Oh --
F	DOROTHY	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
M	TIN MAN	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
M	TIN MAN	Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
M	SCARECROW	But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
F	DOROTHY	And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
M	TIN MAN	Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?

M	SCARECROW	I don't see how. You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
M	TIN MAN	And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.

M	LION	What -- what did you do that for? I didn't bite him.
F	DOROTHY	No, but you tried to.
F	DOROTHY	It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
M	LION	Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?
F	DOROTHY	Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
M	LION	You're right -- I am a coward.

M	TIN MAN	I'd be gentle as a lizard --
M	SCARECROW	I'd be clever as a gizzard --
F	DOROTHY	If the Wizard is a Wizard who will serve.
M	SCARECROW	Then I'm sure to get a brain --
M	TIN MAN	A heart --

M	OZ'S VOICE	...of the West.
M	TIN MAN	B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it! LS -- Throne --
M	OZ'S VOICE	Bring me her broomstick, and I'll grant your requests.
M	OZ'S VOICE	Now, go!
M	LION	But -- but what if she kills us first?
M	OZ'S VOICE	... I ....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...said, -Go!
M	LION	"I'd turn back if I were you." CS -- Two owls on limb of tree --
M	TIN MAN	From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
M	LION	She - she can have my Witch Remover.
F	DOROTHY	Does it work?
M	LION	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
F	DOROTHY	Oh --
M	SCARECROW	Oh, here - give me that thing! MLS - Spray hits the ground - then vanishes -
M	SCARECROW	Oh, did - did you see that?
M	TIN MAN	Oh - look out.
M	SCARECROW	You know something? MCU -- Lion and Scarecrow --
M	SCARECROW	I believe they're spooks around here. MCU -- Dorothy and Tin Man --
M	TIN MAN	That's ridiculous! Spooks -- that's.... MCU -- Lion and Scarecrow -- TIN MAN o.s.
M	LION	Don't you believe in spooks?
M	TIN MAN	No. Why only -- Oh --
F	DOROTHY	Oh! Oh, Tin Man! Oh!
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- Oh --
M	SCARECROW	Oh -- are you -- are you all right? CS -- Lion, his eyes closed tight -- speaks --
M	LION	I do believe in spooks, I do believe in spooks. I do -- I do -- I do -- I do -- I do -- I....
M	LION	...do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks! I do -- I do -- I do -- I do -- I do -- I do!
M	WITCH	You'll believe in more than that before I've finished with you. Take your army to the Haunted Forest, and bring me that girl and her dog! Do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed! They'll give you no trouble, I promise you that. I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them. Take special care of those ruby slippers. I want those most of all. Now, fly! Fly! Bring me that girl and her slippers! Fly! Fly! Fly!
M	LION	What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away!
M	TIN MAN	Hold still - hold still --
F	DOROTHY	Oh! Something bit me, too!
M	TIN MAN	Now come on - you're acting silly --
M	SCARECROW	Oh, come on now - everybody --
F	DOROTHY	Did you just hear what I just heard?
M	LION	That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
F	DOROTHY	It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
M	TIN MAN	It's giving me the jitters In the joints around my knees.
M	SCARECROW	Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
M	TIN MAN	I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
M	LION	As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
F	DOROTHY	Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
M	LION	I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
M	TIN MAN	It's a whozis.
M	SCARECROW	It's a whozis?
M	LION	It's a whatzis.
M	TIN MAN	It's a whatzis?
M	LION	Whozat?
M	TIN MAN	Whozat?
M	SCARECROW	Whozat?
F	DOROTHY	Whozat?
F	DOROTHY	...and the bees
M	ALL	Bug-bug-a-bug-bug-bug-bug-bug-a-boo!
M	ALL	In a twitter
M	SCARECROW	Oh, the critter's
M	TIN MAN	Thar she blows!
M	TIN MAN	Go away now!
M	SCARECROW	Help! Help!
M	LION	Why, I'll -- Foul! Foul!
M	SCARECROW	Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
M	TIN MAN	Oh! Well, what happened to you?
M	SCARECROW	They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
M	TIN MAN	Well, that's you all over.
M	LION	They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
M	SCARECROW	Don't stand there talking! Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
M	TIN MAN	Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
M	LION	Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
M	TIN MAN	Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
M	SCARECROW	Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
M	TIN MAN	Now, now, don't fret.
M	SCARECROW	Oh, dear, dear.
M	TIN MAN	We'll get you together!
M	WITCH	What a nice little dog! And you, my dear. What an unexpected pleasure! It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
F	DOROTHY	What are you going to do with my dog? Give him back to me!
M	WITCH	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, please give me back my dog!
M	WITCH	Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
F	DOROTHY	But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
M	WITCH	Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
F	DOROTHY	No! No -- no! Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
M	WITCH	That's a good little girl. I knew you'd see reason.
M	WITCH	Ahh! Ah!
F	DOROTHY	I'm sorry. I didn't do it! Can I still have my dog?
M	WITCH	No! Fool, that I am! I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as... CU -- Dorothy reacts -- speaks -- WITCH o.s.
F	DOROTHY	What are you gonna do? CU - Witch looks up o.s. - speaks -
M	WITCH	What do you think I'm going to do? But that's not what's worrying me -- it's how to do it. These things must be done delicately....
F	DOROTHY	Run, Toto, run!
M	WITCH	Catch him, you fool!
F	DOROTHY	He got away! He got away!
M	WITCH	Ohhh! Which is more than you will! Drat you and your dog! You've been more trouble to me than you're worth, one way or another -- but it'll soon be over now!
M	WITCH	Do you see that? That's how much longer you've got to be alive! And it isn't.... CU -- Dorothy crying -- WITCH o.s.
M	WITCH	I can't wait forever to get those shoes! CU -- Dorothy crying -- exits left --
M	TIN MAN	There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
M	LION	Yeah --
M	SCARECROW	Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
M	TIN MAN	But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
M	SCARECROW	Why, don't you see? He's come to take us....
M	SCARECROW	...to Dorothy!
M	TIN MAN	Oh --
M	SCARECROW	Come on, fellows!
M	LION	Oh -- Oh -- Oh -- I....
M	LION	...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
M	TIN MAN	I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
F	DOROTHY	Someday, I'll wake and rub my eyes And in that land beyond the skies You'll find me
M	LION	What's that? What's that?
M	TIN MAN	Oh, I hate to think of her in there. We've got to get her out.
M	SCARECROW	Don't cry now. We haven't got the oil- can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
M	LION	Who's them? Who's them?
M	SCARECROW	I've got a plan how to get in there.
M	LION	Fine. He's got a plan
M	SCARECROW	And you're going to lead us.
M	LION	Yeah. Me?
M	SCARECROW	Yes, you.
M	LION	I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
M	SCARECROW	That's right.
M	LION	All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart. I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there. There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
M	LION	Talk me out of it.
M	TIN MAN	No, you don't.
M	SCARECROW	Oh, no!
M	LION	No? Now, wait a minute.
M	TIN MAN	You don't neither --
M	SCARECROW	Up!
M	LION	Now...
F	DOROTHY	I'm frightened, I'm frightened, Auntie Em -- I'm frightened!
M	AUNTIE EM	Dorothy -- Dorothy -- where are you? It's me -- it's Auntie Em. We're trying to find you. Where are you?
F	DOROTHY	I -- I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em. I'm locked up in the Witch's castle....and I'm trying to get home to you, Auntie Em! Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away! I'm frightened! Come back! Come back!
M	WITCH	Auntie Em -- Auntie Em -- come back! I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!
M	SCARECROW	Sssh -- Toto -- be quiet -- (etc.) Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
M	TIN MAN	You put up a great fight, Lion.
M	SCARECROW	Yeah --
M	TIN MAN	I don't know what we'd have done without you.
M	LION	Hah. I - I must have bitten you a couple of times.
M	SCARECROW	Come on -- I've got another idea.
M	LION	Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
M	TIN MAN	Come on -- come on.
M	TIN MAN	Where do we go now?
M	LION	Yeah.
M	SCARECROW	There!
M	SCARECROW	Wait! We'd better make sure. Dorothy, are you in there?
F	DOROTHY	Yes, it's me! She's locked me in!
F	DOROTHY	Oh, I knew you'd get here in time!
M	LION	Listen, fellows. It's her. We gotta get her out! Open this door!
M	LION	...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
M	TIN MAN	Don't push!
M	SCARECROW	Stop pushing!
M	LION	Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
F	DOROTHY	Oh, hurry -- please hurry!
F	DOROTHY	...ty!
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- Oh -- Oh! Toto -- Toto!
M	LION	Did they hurtcha?
F	DOROTHY	Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
M	TIN MAN	Dorothy!
F	DOROTHY	I knew you would!
M	SCARECROW	Hurry -- we've got no time to lose!
F	DOROTHY	Oh!
M	WITCH	...hear of it. Why, my little par-....
M	LION	Trapped! Trapped like mice -- er -- rats! MLS - The Winkies advancing -
M	TIN MAN	Go ahead - do something! Roar! Roar!
M	LION	What good'll it do us?
M	WITCH	That's right. Don't hurt them right away. We'll let....
F	DOROTHY	Oh!
F	DOROTHY	Oh!
M	WITCH	Seize....
M	WITCH	They've gotten away! Stop them! Stop them!
M	SCARECROW	It's no use trying the doors again! Which room is it?
M	LION	They're coming back!
F	DOROTHY	Ohhh!
M	SCARECROW	Oh - upstairs, quickly!
M	TIN MAN	Go on!
M	WITCH	There they go! Ah -- now we've got them! Half you go that way -- half you go that way!
M	WITCH	Go! Go! (etc.)
M	LION	Where -- where do we go now?
M	SCARECROW	This way! Come on!
M	WITCH	Well -- ring around the rosy -- a pocket full of spears! Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you? Well, I'm going to start in on you right here - one after the other!
M	WITCH	How about a little fire, Scarecrow?
M	SCARECROW	No -- No -- No -- No!
F	DOROTHY	Ohh! OHH! OHH!
M	SCARECROW	Help! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! Help! Help! Help!
M	SCARECROW	Help!
M	WITCH	Ohhh -- you cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! Melting! Oh - - what a world -- what a world! Who would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness!? Ohhh! Look out! Look out! I'm going. Ohhhh! Ohhhhhh....
M	LEADER	She's....she's....dead! You've killed her!
F	DOROTHY	I -- I didn't mean to kill her....really I didn't! It's...it's just that he was on fire!
M	LEADER	Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!
M	WINKIES	Hail! Hail to Dorothy -- The Wicked Witch is dead!
F	DOROTHY	You mean, you're...you're all happy about it?
M	LEADER	Very happy - now she won't be able to hit us with a broom....
F	DOROTHY	The broom!
F	DOROTHY	May we have it?
M	LEADER	Please! And take it with you!
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- thank you so much! Now we can go back to the Wizard and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!
M	LEADER	The Wicked Witch is dead!
M	ALL	The Wicked Witch is dead! The Wicked Witch is dead!
M	ALL	Hail - hail - the Wicked Witch is dead!
M	ALL	Ding Dong! The Witch is dead. Which old Witch?
M	ALL	Wake up, you sleepy head Rub your eyes
M	ALL	She's gone where the Goblins go Below -- below -- below! Yo ho, let's open....
M	ALL	...up and sing
M	ALL	...low.
M	ALL	...witch?
M	ALL	Wake up, you sleepy head. Rub your eyes -
M	OZ'S VOICE	Can I believe my eyes? Why....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...have you come back?
F	DOROTHY	Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her.
M	OZ'S VOICE	Oh ....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...you liquidated her, eh? Very....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...resourceful!
F	DOROTHY	Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
M	OZ'S VOICE	Not so fast! Not.... MLS -- Throne --
M	OZ'S VOICE	...so fast! I'll have to give the matter a little thought. Go away and come back tomorrow!
F	DOROTHY	Tomorrow? Oh, but I want to go home now.
M	TIN MAN	You've had plenty of time already!
M	LION	Yeah!
M	OZ'S VOICE	Do not arouse the wrath....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...of the Great and Powerful Oz! I said - - come back tomorrow!
F	DOROTHY	If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
M	OZ'S VOICE	Do you presume to criticize the....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...Great Oz? You ungrateful creatures!
M	OZ'S VOICE	Think yourselves lucky that I'm....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...giving you audience tomorrow, instead of....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...twenty years from now. Oh -- oh oh! The Great Oz has spoken! Oh -- Oh ---
M	OZ'S VOICE	... Oh .... Oh ....
F	DOROTHY	Who are you?
M	OZ'S VOICE	Oh - I - Pay no....
M	OZ'S VOICE	...attention to that man behind the curtain. Go - before I lose my temper! The Great and Powerful ---....
M	OZ'S VOICE	... -- Oz -- has spoken!
F	DOROTHY	Who are you?
M	OZ'S VOICE	Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
F	DOROTHY	You are?
M	WIZARD	Uhhhh -- yes...
F	DOROTHY	I don't believe you!
M	WIZARD	No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
M	SCARECROW	You humbug!
M	LION	Yeah!
M	WIZARD	Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so. I'm a humbug!
F	DOROTHY	Oh ....
F	DOROTHY	...you're a very bad man! MCU -- The Wizard reacts, speaks humbly --
M	WIZARD	Oh, no, my dear -- I'm -- I'm a very good man. I'm just a very bad Wizard.
M	SCARECROW	You'd better be good enough to send Dorothy back to Kansas!
M	WIZARD	Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
M	SCARECROW	It makes you nervous?
M	WIZARD	Yes.
M	SCARECROW	What about us?
M	WIZARD	Well, I --
M	SCARECROW	What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --? Well, I --
M	SCARECROW	-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
M	WIZARD	Well, I --
M	WIZARD	Well, I-- but you've got them. You've had them all the...
M	WIZARD	...time!
M	ALL TOGETHER	Oh, no we haven't!
M	TIN MAN	You don't get around us that easy!
M	LION	Not nohow!
M	WIZARD	Well --
M	SCARECROW	You promised us real things -- a real...
M	SCARECROW	...brain!
M	LION	Real courage. That's what we want.
M	WIZARD	You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
M	WIZARD	Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!
M	WIZARD	From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the Sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - Well, be that as it may. Back where I come from we have universities, seats of great learning -- where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts -- and with no more brains than you have.... But! They have one thing you haven't got! A diploma!
M	WIZARD	Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
M	SCARECROW	Th.D.?
M	WIZARD	Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!
M	SCARECROW	The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh joy, rapture! I've got a brain!
M	SCARECROW	How can I ever thank you enough?
M	WIZARD	Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes. Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city. And they have no more courage than you have. But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal! Therefore -- for meritorious....
M	WIZARD	...conduct, extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery against wicked witches, I award you the Triple Cross.
M	WIZARD	You are now a member of the Legion of Courage!
M	LION	Oh -- Oh -- shucks, folks, I'm speechless!
M	WIZARD	As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
M	TIN MAN	But I still want one.
M	WIZARD	Yes -- ....
M	WIZARD	...back where I come from there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. They are called phil...er -- er -- phil -- er, yes...good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours. But! They have one thing you haven't got! A testimonial!
M	WIZARD	Therefore, in consideration of your kindness, I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend....
M	WIZARD	...that a heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others. Ahh --- Oh, it ticks! Listen!
F	DOROTHY	Yes...!
F	DOROTHY	...yes.
M	TIN MAN	Look -- it ticks!
M	LION	Read...read what my medal says.
M	LION	Courage!...
M	LION	...Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
M	SCARECROW	Hey -- what about Dorothy?
M	TIN MAN	Yes -- how about Dorothy?
M	LION	Yeah.
M	WIZARD	Ah --
M	LION	Dorothy next!
M	WIZARD	Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor -- CU -- Dorothy --
F	DOROTHY	Oh, I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
M	WIZARD	Well, no - no -- on the contrary, on the - of what he'll do - CAMERA TRUCKS forward
M	WIZARD	...I -- ah -- on the contr -- -- Here -- Well, you force me into a cataclysmic decision. The only way to get Dorothy back to Kansas is for me to take her there myself! CU -- Dorothy reacts, speaks --
F	DOROTHY	Oh, will you? Could you? Oh -- but are you a clever enough Wizard.... MCU -- The Wizard -- DOROTHY o.s.
M	WIZARD	Child -- you cut me to the quick! I'm an old Kansas man myself...born and....
M	WIZARD	...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair. It did?
M	WIZARD	Yes. There was I, floating through space - - a man without a continent! CU -- Dorothy --
F	DOROTHY	Weren't you frightened?
M	WIZARD	Frightened? You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified. Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
F	DOROTHY	Ohhh!
M	WIZARD	Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away. And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
M	WIZARD	Good people of Oz, this is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown -- -- yes -- well -- be that as it may -- I, your Wizard par ardua ad alta, am about to embark upon a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere.
M	WIZARD	To confer, converse, and otherwise hob- nob with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time -- if any -- that I return, the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains, shall rule in my stead...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...and the Lion -- by virtue of his courage! Obey them as you would me! And - ah - well, that's all.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, come back here! Toto!
F	DOROTHY	Come back! Oh, don't go without me! I'll be right back! Toto!
M	TIN MAN	Stop that dog!
M	WIZARD	This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
M	TIN MAN	Oh! Help me! The balloon's going up!
M	WIZARD	-- Ruined my exit!
M	TIN MAN	Help!
F	DOROTHY	Oh! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back!
M	WIZARD	I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
F	DOROTHY	Oh --
M	WIZARD	Goodbye, folks!
M	OZ PEOPLE	Goodbye! Goodbye!
F	DOROTHY	Oh, now I'll never get home!
M	LION	Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
M	SCARECROW	Look -- here's someone who can help you!
F	DOROTHY	Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?
F	GLINDA	You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
F	DOROTHY	I have?
M	SCARECROW	Then why didn't you tell her before?
F	GLINDA	Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself.
M	TIN MAN	What have you learned, Dorothy?
F	DOROTHY	Well, I -- I think that it -- that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em -- and it's that -- if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with! Is that right?
F	GLINDA	That's all it is!
M	SCARECROW	But that's so easy! I should have thought of it for you.
M	TIN MAN	I should have felt it in my heart.
F	GLINDA	No. She had to find it out for herself. Now, those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds!
F	DOROTHY	Oh....
F	DOROTHY	...Toto, too?
F	GLINDA	Toto, too.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, now?
F	GLINDA	Whenever you wish.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
M	TIN MAN	Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
F	DOROTHY	Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
M	LION	Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
F	DOROTHY	I think I'll miss you most of all.
F	GLINDA	Are you ready now?
F	DOROTHY	Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.
F	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm ready now.
F	GLINDA	Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
F	GLINDA	And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
F	DOROTHY	There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
F	DOROTHY	-- there's no place like home -- there's no place like home --
F	DOROTHY	-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
M	AUNT EM	Dorothy. Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
F	DOROTHY	Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
M	AUNT EM	Yes, darling.
M	PROFESSOR MARVEL	Hello, there! Anybody home? I -- I just dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big -- Well....
M	UNCLE HENRY	She got quite a bump on the head -- we kinda thought there for a minute she was going to leave us.
M	PROFESSOR	Oh --
F	DOROTHY	But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble. And I tried to get back for days and days.
M	AUNT EM	There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream.
F	DOROTHY	No --
M	HUNK	Sure -- remember me -- your old pal, Hunk?
M	HICKORY	And me -- Hickory?
M	ZEKE	You couldn't forget my face, could you?
F	DOROTHY	No. But it wasn't a dream -- it was a place. And you -- and you -- and you -- and you were there.
M	PROFESSOR	Oh --
F	DOROTHY	But you couldn't have been, could you?
M	AUNT EM	Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we
F	DOROTHY	No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place. And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
F	DOROTHY	...but most of it was beautiful. But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, I want to go home. And they sent me home.
F	DOROTHY	Doesn't anybody believe me?
