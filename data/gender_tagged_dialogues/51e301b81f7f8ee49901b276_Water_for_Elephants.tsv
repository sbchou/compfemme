M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	CHARLIE	Excuse me sir, can we help you? Did you miss your ride?
F	JACOB	I missed the Spec.
M	RUSS	The what?
M	CHARLIE	Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we call someone for you? Where'd it all go?
M	RUSS	He's seriously old.
M	CHARLIE	Did you come with the folks from the retirement home?
F	JACOB	No, I came on my own. Let's go inside and we can call them to pick you up. Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair.
F	JACOB	No, I told ya, I came on my own and I'm not going back. Get your hands off me.
M	RUSS	It's OK. We're gonna call the home so they can come pick you up. Why don't you pick some of those rings out ya head maybe you won't be so stupid, ya dumb little shit.
M	RUSS	Woah! The language. Uncalled for.
M	CHARLIE	Sir, we need to get you out of this parking lot. My trucks have to come through here. Please... He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits.
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I got it Russ. Take the walker. Finish closing up the ticket booth. Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob.
F	JACOB	In my day, they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow. Damn kid didn't even know what the Spec was.
M	CHARLIE	You sound like you know circuses. Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home.
F	JACOB	I should. I was on two.
M	CHARLIE	Malcolm, tell them to come through! Two circuses. Wow, that's something.
F	JACOB	Ringling, of course, but that was later...
M	CHARLIE	I'll need your name when I call the home.
F	JACOB	...First one was called Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show ... Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name.
M	CHARLIE	What?...Wait a minute! Did you say you were with the Benzini Brothers? What years?
M	CHARLIE	"31?...You're saying you were there for the---?
F	JACOB	I was in the middle of it. I don't believe this. After the Hartford Fire and the Hagenback- Wallace Wreck, that's the most famous circus disaster of all time.
F	JACOB	I remember it like yesterday... Better - cause I don't remember yesterday. Charlie O'Brien the third.
F	JACOB	Jacob Jankowski the only.
M	CHARLIE	Mr. Jankowski, I would be honored if you would have a drink with me in my trailer.
F	JACOB	Ah, I remember you...Camel would've loved this stuff.
M	CHARLIE	Camels drink scotch? Jacob laughs, shaking his head No. Charlie pours another;
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	You really got here on you're own?
F	JACOB	The Great Escape! But I got lost.
M	CHARLIE	I should call the home, let them know where you are.
F	JACOB	I don't know why they call it a "home". You don't know anybody there. They fill you so full of drugs, you don't care...Five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died. They take turns visiting me on weekends. They forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up.. I had a life, ya know. A big life...It isn't right. Charlie empathizes. Pours another. Changes the subject.
M	CHARLIE	So, how did the Benzini Brothers stampede start? The story is two guys got thrown off the train and--
F	JACOB	No point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end.
M	CHARLIE	Sorry. From the beginning.
F	JACOB	Now, let's see...the beginning... Well, everything began the same day everything ended...Ha, isn't that how it always works?...
M	JACOB (V.O.)	It was a big day. My final exams.
M	E. JANKOWSKI	Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
M	JACOB (V.O.)	After six years of dissections, castrations, foalings and shoving my arm up a cow's ass more times than I cared to remember, I was finally going to graduate Cornell in Veterinary Science. I was summa cum laude...ha,ha and the oldest male virgin on campus. VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a
M	THE PROCTOR	You may begin. Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam
M	JACOB (V.O.)	I had my whole life planned. I knew exactly where it was taking me... And then, with the opening of a door, it all vanished. The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean
M	THE PROCTOR	Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word? Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up.
M	DEAN WILKINS	Jacob, it's your parents. I'm afraid there's been a car accident.
M	CORONER	Are you ready? The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder.
M	CHAPLAIN	Is there any other family to call?
F	JACOB	No. Just me.
M	HYDE	I know this is difficult for you, but there's been no mistake. The house and all their assets, including your father's practise, are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage.
F	JACOB	But I'm telling you, my father put away every penny he ever earned. They owned that house outright. Why would he have a mortgage?
M	HYDE	My guess is because he let people pay him in beans & eggs or whatever they had, instead of money.
F	JACOB	And so he's penalized for not turning away people who couldn't afford his help? He was a doctor.
M	HYDE	Yes, I know, he was a very good man but in banking terms, in the reality of what makes this world actually function, he was an irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but you oughta to know the truth. This Depression is going to last for a long while.. ..And the only ones who will be standing at the end of it, are the ones who fight to take what they need to survive. Everyone else is going to disappear. Don't make the same mistakes as your father. Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	Things happened so fast, my head was spinning. And that mortgage...I just couldn't figure it out. A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up at the curb. It is met by A BANK
M	BANK REPRESENTATIVE	This just came for you, Jacob. Whatever it is I'm going to have to include in the bank's report of assets. Sorry. You OK? I also have documents to sign.. The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the I didn't believe the lawyer or the bank. My mother worked. They had savings. We were never broke. So why would they need a mortgage? And then it hit me... Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN, reading; They did it to pay for my Ivy League education. For a moment Jacob can't move. This thought stuns him. With
M	BANK REPRESENTATIVE	Jacob? Jacob they need these signed by the end of the business day. Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and
M	JACOB (V.O.)	I walked and I kept on walking... It's a strange feeling becoming an orphan the same time you're becoming a man...To have this freedom to be anything you want at the same time everything you were is taken away. So I just walked ...Then all of a sudden, I stopped.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	Like I'd been sleepwalking and I woke up. I had no idea where I was. Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and What is it inside of us makes us decide to grab onto life again and again, no matter how many times it abandons us without a second thought?...What is it makes us hungry for more of the same? Somebody smart should figure that one out. Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the
M	OLD TIMER (O.S.)	Oh, don't go messin with Blackie. Throwing people off of trains is one of the perks of his job. Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene lamp.
M	BLACKIE	We don't need no bums on this train brother. You can get off right now and keep running. Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg,
M	OLD TIMER	Now everybody calm down here. Grady put that damn rifle away. BLACKIE LET'IM GO...And I mean on the inside of the train! Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him.
M	OLD TIMER (CONT'D)	I'm tellin ya, ya can't red light him, we don't need that trouble. Look at them clothes - he's no bum. Blackie scans Jacob's clothes, then tosses him inside the
M	OLD TIMER (CONT'D)	Don't be sore kid. It's more like a reflex with Blackie. I'm Camel..And that there's Grady. And Bill.
F	JACOB	Jacob. Jankowski. Nice to meet you.
M	CAMEL	You're pretty young for the rails. You running from something boy? You on the lam?
F	JACOB	No. Nothing like that.
M	CAMEL	Where you headed?
F	JACOB	I don't know.
M	CAMEL	Hungry? Outta work? No shame in it. What can you do?
F	JACOB	About anything I guess. Camel gives him the once-over look then offers the jug.
M	CAMEL	We land in Deposit in the morning. We'll find you some work. And if you're still alive by the end of it, I'll get you some food and take you to Uncle August. Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor.
F	JACOB	Who's that?
M	GRADY	August Rosenbluth...Lord and Master of the Known and Unknown Universes. Ringmaster Extraordinaire. Jacob looks baffled. Camel laughs as he drinks more;
M	CAMEL	Oh kid, don't tell me you didn't notice? Grady and Bill laugh though Blackie remains un-amused.
M	BILL	Ha, he really don't know.
M	CAMEL	HA! You didn't just jump a train boy. You jumped the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth... You done landed your ass on a circus, kid! PRE-LAP: The Circus Train brakes screeching to a halt! Jacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees:: Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down. He is out
M	THE ANIMALS.	Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an
F	JACOB	What is it? What do you want? The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing. Jacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants. But deciding to
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	You're welcome, ma'am. The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den. What the hell you doing in here? Get outta there!! You ain't a menagerie man. Only menagerie men is allowed in there. Jacob runs out to Camel.
M	CAMEL	Gonna try to get you set up with Crazy Joe.
F	JACOB	Do I call him Crazy Joe?
M	CAMEL	It has been said Crazy Joe went to prison for killing a man who spit into the wind and hit the back of Joe's neck. So no, I would not call this man Crazy Joe to his face. Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where
M	CAMEL (CONT'D)	Hey Joe! I got a First of May here. Think you can use him? Crazy Joe scans Jacob, shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco
M	CAMEL (CONT'D)	You're in, kid.
F	JACOB	I've never seen so much manure!
M	WADE	Baggage stock horses. They pack'em in 27 a car.
F	JACOB	How do you stand the smell?
M	WADE	What smell?
M	WADE	When Cecil gives the signal ya gotta push the rubes in towards the entrance but without them catching on or else they'll be a fight. Jacob, Wade and the other men position themselves equidistant When Cecil pulls his ear (the Signal)...Jacob and the other
M	GRADY	Stand inside the tent and smack the sides with this when you see a head trying to peek in without paying. Jacob follows Grady into the tent... Jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman. Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts
F	JACOB	Excuse me, ma'am? Hi. I'm Jacob. Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	May I? He may be foundering. Marlena nods. Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	He should be all right for tonight. But I'd put him on stall rest as soon as possible. He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down. Marlena looks Jacob arrives as we reveal: Jacob can barely contain himself...The Audience - young and During Jacob's lines we see; Clowns, jugglers, acrobats,
M	JACOB (V.O.)	You never saw anything like it. You could hardly take it all in without fearing you might go blind from the shine. From one kind of world too hard to bear came some kind a heaven no one knew existed. End on Jacob seeing: Marlena gloriously atop her horses who
M	JACOB (V.O.)	And then just as quickly, heaven was packed away and gone.
M	CAMEL	You like the food? You deserve it. You done good, I hear.. ..Woah, you better take a breath before it all comes back up on ya. Here. Have a hit of Jake. He offers Jacob his "Jake". Jacob drinks and chokes.
M	CAMEL (CONT'D)	It's an acquired taste. Now get yourself outta there. I'm gonna take you in to see August. As Jacob squeezes out, the Contortionist unwinds himself and
F	JACOB	But it's the middle of the night.
M	CAMEL	Only time circus people live - when they don't have to work. Come on... instruments...looking at Jacob with suspicion and wry humor.
M	CAMEL	I got a son about your age. Lives outside of Reading, PA. Haven't seen him for years. Fix your shirt there. Jacob shoves in his shirt. Camel smiles. He likes the kid. Remember, when you meet August let him do the talking and don't ever mention Ringling. He hates them bastards worse than the Depression. - Barbara and the Coochie Girls Car; Girls in various forms
F	BARBARA	How's your pipe, kid? Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away.
M	CAMEL	Night ladies.
M	BARBARA AND GIRLS	Night Camel.
F	JACOB	Hey Camel - who's that woman who works the horses? Now stop right there. That's Marlena. She don't talk to nobody and you don't talk to her. And don't mention her to August. Ain't no right way to talk about somebody's wife and make it sound like a compliment.
F	JACOB	Wife? Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask:
M	CAMEL	Look, kid, before we do this, I gotta ask... ..I ain't tryin to know your business but I do know you ain't been on the road too long. You're too clean, your clothes too nice and you don't got a possession on you. See, a man on the road collects little things. It's not a big life I can tell ya. So before you start, I ask: if you got any kind of life to go back to, that's what you should do. Jacob stops. He tries to not sound emotional when he says:
F	JACOB	I don't. Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said.
M	CAMEL	I am sorry to hear that. They move on.
M	CAMEL	This here's Earl. He's gonna take you in. Earl, this here's Jacob.
F	JACOB	I don't know how to thank you.
M	CAMEL	HA! You may not want to after you been on a show long as I have. Good luck to ya, kid. Camel exits OS. Alone with Earl, Jacob asks:
F	JACOB	Do I look OK?
M	EARL	Very nice. Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the Earl shoves him against the wall, dangling him off the floor.
M	AUGUST	What's this?
M	EARL	That stowaway the old drunk took under his wing. College boy. Jacob tries to explain but Earl bangs him against the wall.
M	AUGUST	I'll see your three and raise you five... I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
F	JACOB	Jacob Jankowski, sir.
M	AUGUST	And what is a "Jacob Jankowski" and why he is on my train?
F	JACOB	Just looking for work, sir.
M	MR. ERWIN	Can you fly? Set yourself on fire?
F	JACOB	No sir.
M	AUGUST	Ever worked a show, son?
F	JACOB	No sir.
M	AUGUST	Ever been to a show?
F	JACOB	Yes sir... Jacob, sensing where this is going, gets August's attention; Ringling Brothers. August stops playing cards. The others react with sudden
M	AUGUST	Ringling, you say?
F	JACOB	Yes. But it was terrible.
M	AUGUST	Really? Have you seen our show? What was your favorite act? Jacob sees a CIRCUS POSTER with Marlena and her Horses.
F	JACOB	The uh...the one with the black and white horses. And the girl in pink.
M	AUGUST	Ah, our Star Attraction. Well, I believe we're looking for a boy to carry water for the elephants, aren't we Diamond Joe?
M	DIAMOND JOE	We don't have an eleph-
M	AUGUST	Shut-up.
F	JACOB	I would do that, sir. I'd like to work with the animals. August and the others chuckle. Jacob doesn't understand why.
M	AUGUST	And you'd carry water for elephants? Ha, ha...you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks, kid? College! Pfft! Never met a college man yet who knew his own ass from shinola. You eat my food and you ride my train like you're entitled to survive. But you see, nothing survives here without my permission...Maybe if you tell me you're nothing, I'll let you stay, although my bet is you won't last. Jacob refuses to let August demean him. He stays silent.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	You smell like every kind of shit. Why would a college boy want that?
F	JACOB	Times are hard for everybody...And I guess because ... out of all the dirt and sweat and shit and working with fellas you don't want to be caught dead meeting in the daylight, comes...so much beauty. We think August and the men are moved by Jacob's words.
M	AUGUST	That's beautifully put. Toss him off, Earl. And make sure you see the red light before you red light him. As Earl drags Jacob in tow, August derides him to the others;
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Another sonny boy mad at mommy and daddy for paying the bills. Sounds like he studied poetry.
M	CRAZY JOE	I got no use for people who rhyme.
F	JACOB	It was veterinary science! And I can tell you one thing - that Star Attraction horse of yours won't be walking in a few days let alone performing center ring!! August stops and turns.
M	AUGUST	Earl wait! Earl stops with Jacob. Now all the men are intrigued...
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Veterinary science? May I ask what school?
F	JACOB	Cornell. You're a Cornell graduate? Jacob lies and nods...August wonders whether to trust Jacob.
M	DIAMOND JOE	Marlena did want a vet to take a look at Silver Star. They cost.
M	CECIL	He worked the rubes for me this afternoon. Pretty good.
M	CRAZY JOE	He shovelled horse shit. Don't make him a horse doctor. August looks reluctant. Until Jacob caps it:
F	JACOB	I hear Ringling has its own vet. The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this. But it
M	AUGUST	All right, Cornell. Come with me. August leads Jacob out.
M	AUGUST	Are you sure-footed, Jacob Jankowski?
F	JACOB	I believe so.
M	AUGUST	Good. Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of The train jerks a curve. Jacob almost falls.
M	COME ON THEN!	Jacob looks up to see: August is on the roof of the train: his face moonlit, his Jacob's right hand meets the ladder. His left grasps wildly
M	AUGUST	It's a breath taking sight, isn't it? Always gets me. I can't get a new Liberty Horse mid- season. So you make sure this horse performs and the job's yours. Nine bucks a week. If you cross me, I'll feed you to my meat eaters and there won't be a trace left of you... Jacob hangs on every word. August smiles;
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	You do right by me, Jacob Jankowski...I'll show you what it's like to travel every inch of this country, every inch of this world, and be welcomed home in every street, be loved in every town...I'll give you a life most suckers can't dream of. Jacob is mesmerized by August. August stands and tap dances
M	AUGUST	Kinko.
M	KINKO (WALTER)	August.
M	AUGUST	This is Jacob. He's going to bunk with you a while.
F	JACOB	How do you do?
M	KINKO (WALTER)	What is he?
M	AUGUST	I said his name is Jacob. I asked what, not who.
M	AUGUST	He's going to help out in the menagerie. A menagerie man? Performers don't bunk with working men. There's a growl from his loyal Russell terrier, QUEENIE.
M	AUGUST	Well there are performers.. And then there are performers.. Considering we used to keep the goats in here, I'm sure Marlena's horses out there object to now sharing their quarters with you. Of course I can always change that and send you back to a bottom bunk with the other kinkers who sorely miss your sunny personality and affectionate camaraderie. This gentleman is the show's new veterinarian - Ivy League no less - which puts him a good deal higher than you in my estimation. Perhaps you'd like to offer him your cot. As the kerosene lamp light flickers in August's face, Kinko
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	I'll find you in the morning. Sleep well, Cornell. August exits....Jacob is left staring at resentful Kinko and
F	JACOB	A Jack Russell. They're very smart. Queenie attack. Queenie jumps at Jacob, growling, hunch backed. Jacob is
M	KINKO (WALTER) (CONT'D)	You're not getting the cot.
M	CAMEL	Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling asleep on me. Pretty soon the only place for me is going to be selling tickets but I'm too ugly for that.
M	AUGUST (O.S.)	Jacob! Camel straightens up when August appears, clearly on his
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	We can do better than this for our new vet. I'll arrange for you to start getting your own water bucket like the performers and bosses. Two buckets per person. Come... August walks away as Jacob hurries to follow...
F	JACOB	See ya Camel.
M	CAMEL	Yeah, take care kid.
M	AUGUST	You'll need new clothes too. I'll set you up with the Monday Man.
F	JACOB	Monday Man?
M	AUGUST	What day of the week did your mother hang out the wash to dry? He takes other people's clothes?
M	AUGUST	It's the Depression, Cornell. Where have you been? Oh right - Cornell. Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Here, use Kinko's second bucket for now. You barely use up one. Kinko fumes. Jacob tries to placate.
F	JACOB	August, it's all right, I'll-- If you need a razor, there are some back there with my name on them. August walks away. Jacob follows August away from Kinko.
F	JACOB	August.. When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard... It's good to have an educated man like you around. I need one other sane individual in this operation. Thank you for everything, August. August pats his back and exits. Jacob heads for the bucket.
M	AUGUST (O.S.)	Ah...Jacob? Yes, August?
M	AUGUST	The horse. August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse. Jacob thought
F	JACOB	Oh! Yes...The horse. Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride.
M	AUGUST	I'm sure it's nothing serious. Don't tell my wife I said this but she coddles them too much. She has a particularly strong affection for Silver Star. I don't encourage it. It's unhealthy to love an animal that much...Here she is. Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Darling, meet Jacob Jankowski, Benzini Brothers own veterinarian.
F	JACOB	It's a pleasure to meet you. Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous
M	AUGUST	Last stall. Lead the way, doc. They enter the ring stock car...
M	AUGUST	Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad in the show. Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Is that the problem? Do you need any hoof testers? Diamond Joe has them...
F	JACOB	Not yet.
M	AUGUST	Well, how are you going to fix it? Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the
F	JACOB	I didn't want to say anything in front of... Mrs. Rosenbluth...he's already foundering.
M	AUGUST	English.
F	JACOB	This horse isn't getting back on his feet, August. If there was anything I could do, I would but we're going to have to put him down...I'm real sorry. Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through
M	AUGUST	I know you are. Come with me. August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows.
M	AUGUST	Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm afraid. Jacob here says there's no hope. We're going to have to put him down... Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	...So I need you to round up Pete and Greg, get a wagon and a harness stretcher. He has to be hauled.
M	DIAMOND JOE	A harness what?
M	AUGUST	Jacob and I'll take care of the cats. We'll meet you back at the stall. Grab the other bucket, will you? Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and
F	JACOB	August, this stuff has gone off. Do the cats really eat this?
M	AUGUST	No, they really love goats. We're all out of goats.
M	AUGUST	Go ahead. They get a bucket each. Apprehensive, Jacob hops up. August hands him the buckets.
F	JACOB	What do I do, just open the door and toss it in?
M	AUGUST	Unless you think a formal sit-down is appropriate. Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound cat Why don't you start with Rex... that's him on the left. August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane Not that one, that one. He points to a difference bucket. Jacob can see no difference
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	What's the matter? Didn't they cover this in school? August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbing Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JACOB
F	JACOB	What the hell is wrong with you? You think that's funny? Yes I do! Aw Jacob wait! Don't be sore! I was having a little fun!
F	JACOB	FUN! I could have lost my arm! Rex hasn't got any teeth... Jacob feels more foolish and walks away, when, just as
M	AUGUST (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Jacob.. Jacob stops and turns. August isn't laughing any more. He has
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	..people want their money back when the Star Act on the poster isn't in the ring! A Star Attraction keeps a circus alive. Without it, animals eat that and men eat nothing. It takes time to find and train another horse so without Silver Star, I have no Star Act.
F	JACOB	I don't know how he's been performing August, but you don't have a Star Act now. That horse can't walk and if he does you'll lose him. He's in a lot of pain.
M	AUGUST	Like this? August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack. Jacob
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	We always have choices, Jacob - a choice between our pain and someone else's. That horse was performing before you came and he will continue to perform until he drops dead. I'm telling you to keep it alive and that's what you'll do or you'll be red lit like anyone else who doesn't obey the law here. Every nation has it's own laws under God, Jacob. You left America the second you jumped my train. I like you. Believe me, I do. I'm only thinking of your future. August lets go of his arm and walks away. Jacob is angry.
F	MARLENA	Tell me the truth. What's wrong with him? Jacob hesitates before answering, then:
F	JACOB	The connective tissues between the hoof and the coffin bone are compromised and the coffin bone rotates toward the sole of the hoof. If he keeps walking, it'll puncture through...He's in a lot of pain.
F	MARLENA	And if he rests?
F	JACOB	You'll lose him anyway. I'm sorry. Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears
F	MARLENA	Then you have to put him down. Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised.
F	JACOB	It's the right thing to do.
F	MARLENA	But August won't let you.
F	JACOB	If I'm the show's vet then it's my decision, isn't it?
F	MARLENA	But August won't like it.
F	JACOB	Then it'll be my last decision. Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't
M	CAMEL	Hey kid. What are you doing on the wrong side of the tracks?
F	JACOB	I need a gun.
M	CAMEL	It can't be that bad... They laugh but Jacob insists boldly.
F	JACOB	I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now! Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle.
M	KINKO	What do you think you're doing?
F	JACOB	Shut-up! Both of you! Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena. You should go.
F	MARLENA	No. I'll keep him calm. Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle Jacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	I'll be sorry to see you go, Mr. Jankowski. She exits O.S. with the rifle.
F	JACOB	Friends now? August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks
M	AUGUST	You've got a gift for them. Like Marlena with horses. It's God- given. I can always spot it. Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. He
F	JACOB	My father used to say that to me.
M	AUGUST	He must have been a wise man. This stops Jacob. Beat. He turns to August.
F	JACOB	How is Marlena? August tilts his head curiously, with a smile.
M	AUGUST	You're a genuine curiosity Jacob Jankowski. What am I to do with you? ... I threaten to throw you off a moving train, feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway. So I think - Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob to disobey me and shoot that horse, that horse must have been in pretty bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to injure my Marlena during the show. And so I think Jacob Jankowski might be a valuable person to have around.
F	JACOB	Tell Diamond Joe the animals need more water when the humidity's this bad if I don't see him before I go.
M	AUGUST	You're not going anywhere. You belong here. These animals..they've been waiting for you. Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	But don't ever disobey me like that again. I'll give you this one. I'll call it "respect"...Next one I call "betrayal". Understood? I do thank you though. You and Silver Star solved a much bigger problem for me. August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket.
F	JACOB	What problem? August lights, inhales, blows smoke then:
M	AUGUST	The cats. You see, meat eaters are always more valuable to a circus than hay burners. And you saw what we had to feed them.
F	JACOB	What does Silver Star have to do with the cats?
M	AUGUST	We should have just enough food for them to get us to the next show, thanks to you. Of course Marlena won't speak to me for a day or two but she'll come around...So, I was right. You are a valuable man. As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved;
F	JACOB	August, what did you do? August?
M	JACOB (V.O.)	I couldn't stop thinking about Marlena. I didn't see her for three days. Our shows were cancelled and we kept moving because, word was, August found a "dead one"... The train wheels screech as it begins to stop. Jacob rises
F	JACOB	Why are we stopping?
M	KINKO	August loves his sideshow freaks. There's a guy with this outfit who has a parasitic twin growing out of his chest. He dresses it in a tiny tuxedo and black patent leather shoes. No talent but a real money- maker with the rubes. Calls himself the Man and a Half. Goddamn August'll pay him double what he pays me just for the irony.
F	JACOB	What happened to this circus?
M	KINKO	Went belly up. Pretty common nowadays. Circus bosses see the end coming and they'd pull a runner with all the money. Menagerie belongs to the town now. August can get anything he wants for a song. Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as
M	KINKO (CONT'D)	Most of them will never belong to another show. And they know it. August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so A deliriously happy August is walking and holding the
M	AUGUST	We have a new star!
M	DIAMOND JOE	The Man and a Half?
M	AUGUST	Nah, lousy Ringling got here first. But we got better! A bull!
F	JACOB	A bull?
M	AUGUST	A bull elephant! Her name is Rosie, she's fifty-three and she's brilliant. The best bull they had. I'm going to come up with a whole new Star Act around her and Marlena.. You can ride her in the Spec from now on, since we have no Liberty Horse. August smiles at Marlena who looks back contemptuously, upset
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	...Our own bull! Ringling can't hold that over us now. I'm renovating an entire car just for her.
M	CRAZY JOE	Just for the elephant! But the bunkers are at capacity! I've got roustabouts three to a bunk. August tosses off this concern.
M	AUGUST	We'll find places for everyone. And when our new star sells tickets, we'll buy another car! We're a show to be reckoned with now! ROSIE THE ELEPHANT: She is gargantuan. Ten feet tall at the
F	JACOB	She has such long eye lashes.
M	DIAMOND JOE	She's a hundred if she's a day. We're lucky if she can move.
M	AUGUST	Darling, what do you think? She's magnificent, isn't she? Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent.
M	ROSIE'S CARETAKER	You the bull man?
M	AUGUST	No. This is my menagerie man.
M	ROSIE'S CARETAKER	Where's your bull man? Ya got no bull man, I gotta tell the township or else they can't sell her to ya. August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward;
M	AUGUST	Here he is. He's my bull man.. Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then:
M	ROSIE'S CARETAKER	All right. See this animal...this here's the stupidest Goddamn animal on the face of God's good earth....Here's your bull hook. You're gonna need it. He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long
M	AUGUST	I don't believe it. The mayor said she was the best bull you had.
M	ROSIE'S CARETAKER	If she was the best bull, why is she the only one left? You think you're the first show to turn up picking on the bones? August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:
M	ROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D)	Some elephant tramp who dropped dead in Genesee sold her for a song which still ain't no bargain cause she ain't done a damn thing since but eat everything in sight. Well, good luck to ya. And if I don't ever see another dumb bull in my life it'll be too soon. Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough. She lifts, aims, and Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from The Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping. He
M	AUGUST	Joe, you and Greg come with me. We have to find a car to renovate. See what you can do with her. They exit. Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as
F	JACOB	Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not speaking out of turn here but - but I had no idea they were going to do that to Silver Star.
F	MARLENA	I know....Thank you. This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	And please, call me Marlena. I'm not a snob like everybody thinks. Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up.
F	JACOB	Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski. This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth. Can you say Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth? Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	You're a beauty, huh. Skin's a little dry, you oughta take care of that. First thing you notice about a woman's age is her skin. Rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore Jacob's body.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	Are you flirting with me young lady? I usually like to make the first move...
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	I like to get to know a girl first...take her out. Meet her folks... Of course, aggressive women can be a nice change... Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob.
F	MARLENA	I think you two are engaged. They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena. Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	I think Rosie likes music. That harmonica song is lovely.
F	JACOB	I'm confessin that I love you. Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's "confession".
F	MARLENA	What?
F	JACOB	The name of the song. "I'm Confessin' That I Love You."
F	MARLENA	--"Confessin' that I love you." Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking
M	JACOB MARLENA	Louis Armstrong. Right.
M	KINKO	Queenie stop. Queenie stops. Kinko returns to his book. Jacob sees a NEW
F	JACOB	What is it?
M	KINKO	It's trouble, that's what. Not that I give a damn, but you're playing with dynamite with those two and you're gonna blow all of us up. August is the meanest sonofabitch I've ever met.
F	JACOB	I admit he has his moments of insanity but he's really a very generous, charming guy.
M	KINKO	You don't get it, do you? When August feeds your arm to a lion - that's the real August. The one who's generous and charming - that's the insane August. They hear a fight outside the car. They move to investigate:
M	KINKO	Six men got red lit last night. Cancelling shows and that damn elephant cost August. He needed to clean house to save on payroll... It's a lousy day when an animal gets paid and men don't.
F	JACOB	Why are they beating him?
M	KINKO	He hid one of the men who was supposed to be tossed. Word was the train was over a trestle instead of land. Nobody comes back from that.
M	AUGUST	Get rid of him. He comes back on my property, you can shoot him. August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day.
M	AUGUST	JACOB! Come in, come in! Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car,
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Darling, our guest has arrived. Jacob's eyes go wide upon seeing Marlena who appears looking
F	MARLENA	I'm so glad you could come. Would you like a beer? Or champagne?
F	JACOB	I'm not dressed for champagne.
M	AUGUST	We can fix that, can't we darling? August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	We're celebrating our new star, Rosie. My plan is to have the act ready for the Manhattan/Jersey show so she can start selling tickets. Unfortunately we had to let some men go last night... Jacob listens to how August will explain this:
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	...I don't like doing it, not one bit. But to keep hard working men working, I had to get rid of lay- abouts and thieves who are dead weight. If I had the funds to pay them all I would, but times being as they are...I regret it though. Jacob believes him. August turns to him, with cheer:
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	So tomorrow, my faithful bull man, we begin! But tonight - we dine!! Tonight, we all deserve champagne! August whisks the velvet curtain aside:
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Ta-dah! A tuxedo for Jacob, who smiles, impressed. - Marlena's dress barely covers her shoulders, exposing her - Jacob is wiping his plate clean as August proudly offers - Wine is poured over and over...as the evening continues.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Jacob, I want to apologize to you, in front of my darling Marlena so she can witness how truly sorry I am for any bit of nastiness between us...Running this show, the many pressures...It can get the best of me sometimes I'm afraid.
F	MARLENA	People don't realize how much August does holding everything together. How difficult it is in these times. The whole company is like a family to him.
M	AUGUST	Thank you my love. He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob;
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	From now on I shall trust your judgement in all things veterinarian. Please say you accept my apology. Jacob is enamoured with August again, especially seeing
F	JACOB	Of course I do, August. You've been nothing but swell to me.
M	AUGUST	Good man! I could truly use a friend I can trust. Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours more
F	JACOB	I have to tell you something. You may not trust me after you hear it. August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	I never took my final exams at Cornell. I'm not a real vet. Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	But it's true. I never got my degree. I'm not a licensed vet. They laugh even harder.
M	AUGUST	BAH! A worthless piece of paper from the ivy bush league! Of course you're a vet. You have the gift. You're idealism is just so...sweet. When are you going to learn that the rules written of, by and for these united states of suckers do not apply to us.
F	JACOB	Not about this, August.
M	AUGUST	All right, let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth?
F	JACOB	No.
M	AUGUST	No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at the tops. And you really think the Tattooed Man got tattooed by headhunters in Borneo? He's from Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to ink himself. And you know what I did when the hippo died? Swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her. For two weeks, we travelled with a pickled hippo..
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	..The world is run on tricks - in here and out there. So trust me, it's having a talent that counts. In this world, it's all that's real. Look at this country, these dead, God awful towns we play. Talent and illusion bringing life to what is dead...Even for just a matinee. How wonderful is that? Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	To talent and illusion!
F	JACOB	To Rosie!
F	MARLENA	And Silver Star. August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena...
M	AUGUST	To all we love. He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice,
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Come on Jacob! It's customary to sing for your supper! Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them. Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
M	JACOB (V.O.)	He looked like a different man when he looked at her. I said to myself, maybe love does that to a man. I didn't know much about it. Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively.
F	MARLENA	Darling. Darling, please.. Gently. We have a guest. August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Darling, what is it? August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	August, dear... She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	You don't know your own strength, my love. And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens,
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Auggie? August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Excuse me, Jacob. Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the
F	JACOB	Is everything all right? Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she
F	MARLENA	Oh yes. He's just had too much to drink, that's all. I hope you had a good time tonight. I wanted so much to make things up to you.
F	JACOB	Tonight was your idea?
F	MARLENA	Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt horrible about what happened. He really does like you Jacob. But it's hard for him. He's under a lot of pressure. He does more than people realize holding things together.
F	JACOB	You said that.
F	MARLENA	Well it's true... One dance before you go? Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Jankowski is Polish isn't it? Is that all right? Yes, of course, sorry...I just think it's interesting. I don't know what I am, besides August's wife....I grew up in foster homes since I was a baby.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas...I must have covered a dozen states by the time I was 17. I'd make up stories about who my parents were... When I was five, I pretended for a whole year my mother was an Appaloosa mare... They both laugh. I did! ... and I pretended that I was really an Appaloosa filly...and that I was just dreaming I was a girl and one day, I'd wake up...and I'd run home. Anyway, I was a lot safer inside those stables than I ever was inside those homes... Marlena stops, not wanting to continue. Jacob finds a new
F	JACOB	What happened at 17?
F	MARLENA	There was a parade for the circus. At the head, there were six black Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red tassles. So proud! So beautiful. And August was leading them. The second he looked at me, the way he looked at me, I knew I'd never live with strangers again. And the way he talked. Told me "I'd find a home in every city..welcomed in every town...and he'd give me--
M	JACOB/MARLENA	-- a life most suckers can't dream of"! Ha, you too, huh? It's a wonderful lie, isn't it?
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	But he said he'd make me a Star Attraction and he did. I'm pretty lucky he found me. Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out:
F	JACOB	He was pretty lucky to find you. Marlena is surprised by the compliment...and endeared.
F	MARLENA	You're sweet to say so. Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject:
F	JACOB	Pretty song.
F	MARLENA	Don't tell him what happened... Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them.
F	JACOB	Oh no Marlena, I won't ever tell. Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him;
F	MARLENA	That's the name of the song. "Don't Tell Him What Happened To Me". Ruth Etting. She's one of my favorites.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Are you much of a wine drinker?
F	JACOB	I have no idea.
F	MARLENA	Maybe you should go to bed. Where's that? Marlena laughs. Jacob's bow tie is undone - she ties it;
F	MARLENA	Here, let me...We can't let you go out there all untied. A circus is a small town. What will people say? As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Sweet, sweet Jacob... I'm not that sweet.
F	MARLENA	Good night. Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob But the sound of Jacob's voice immediately makes Queenie stop Kinko, Barbara and the Coochie girls stop laughing and stare
M	KINKO	JACOB MY FRIEND!! Folks, this is my friend and roommate Jacob. I'd like you all to make him feel at home! Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can
M	JACOB (O.S.)	Where am I? Kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes, props
M	KINKO	Where are you right now or where are you in an Aristotelean context because right now you're in a trunk. Inside the trunk, O.S. Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and
M	JACOB (O.S.)	Where are my clothes? I'm not wearing anything underneath this---
M	KINKO	Huh-huh. As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms. What the hell did I do last night?
M	KINKO	You threw up on Barbara...And maybe Nell.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	I feel sick.
M	KINKO	You look a little pale. Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time:
M	KINKO	Your balls itchy? Pissed off, Jacob continues to dress.
M	KINKO	It'll grow back. Aw come on, you still store about last night? Now I figure we're even. In fact, I probably owe you one. Feel free to borrow a book.
F	JACOB	Let's just drop it. Kinko opens a book to read. Jacob notices Queenie's quiet.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	What's wrong with Queenie?
M	KINKO	What do you mean "wrong"?
F	JACOB	I mean she's not hating me. Something's wrong.
M	KINKO	Yeah, she's been like this all day. I don't know...she must have eaten something. She did her business and it was kind of...watery.
F	JACOB	Her stool? Did you look at it for parasites? I don't like looking at my own.
F	JACOB	Get some honey from the cookhouse. And if you can find any slippery elm powder. But the honey should do it. If not, we'll check her for parasites. Jacob starts to exit. As Kinko reads his book;
M	KINKO	Jacob? Thanks.
F	JACOB	Sure Kinko. He moves to exit again. Kinko never looks up from book;
M	KINKO	Jacob?
F	JACOB	Yeah.
M	KINKO	My real name's Walter. They never look at each other but a friendship is formed.
M	AUGUST	We got big trouble. Lucinda died. Now we've got no center ring star act and no sideshow star...
F	JACOB	How did she die?
M	MR. ERWIN	I don't know where we're gonna find a fat lady this late in the season.
M	AUGUST	I don't care where you find one, but find one. Better get some kind of rig set up to lift her out of the car. How did you carry Silver Star out?
M	DIAMOND JOE	In pieces.
M	AUGUST	Oh yes... Mmmm...
F	JACOB	August!
M	AUGUST	No, no, of course, don't be silly! Right. Well, figure something else out Joe but get it down for the performance. Put her in the hippo tank for now. You better start on that elephant. We need her performing yesterday.
F	JACOB	Rosie...Up. Rosie just looks at him without moving.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	Up. Rosie. Up. Rosie's trunk starts to sniff around Jacob. Rosie....Walk!...STEP!..Rosie STEP!
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	Rosie please. My hair hurts. Rosie's trunk snakes around him.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	No...No more Cracker Jack until you do something....Rosie!... Rosie curls her trunk around Jacob and slowly topples him I'm getting really mad now....I mean it...Rosie stop... Rosie gets the Cracker Jack from his back pocket...
M	AUGUST (V.O.)	You just can't get enough of somebody in your pants, can you? Jacob quickly gets up as August strides towards him;
M	AUGUST (V.O. (CONT'D)	Heard you had a rough night?
F	JACOB	Does everybody know what happened?
M	AUGUST	Yes.
F	JACOB	Can somebody tell me? August suppresses a laugh.
M	AUGUST	I'm opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night. We'll see how she does with the crowd. She got any skills?
F	JACOB	Finding food? But I don't really know how to do this.
M	AUGUST	Well, first of all, you can't do anything with a bull without the bull hook. August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	It's the only way to train them. Watch. Jacob steps back. August stabs Rosie behind the shoulder..Jacob winces. Rosie August keeps jabbing her with the hook...dotting her flesh
F	JACOB	August, there's got to be another way.
M	AUGUST	We don't have the time! She has to start earning her keep MOVE! UP!
M	UP!!	August stabs her other shoulder...harder...continuing to
F	JACOB	Please, August, let me try again. But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob:
M	AUGUST	Don't tell me my business! You don't want to watch this, get the hell out! Making love to it ain't going to work. Besides, from what I hear, you're not that good at it. Jacob watches, upset and furious at August's treatment.
F	JACOB	I'm so sorry girl. Just a few more here. Hold still. The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull Rosie? WE SEE: Rosie's trunk come out from under the canvas, her
M	JACOB (V.O.)	We were on our way to the Manhattan/ Jersey show and Mr. Erwin still hadn't found a fat lady. Tickets sales were low. So August, ha,ha...August pulled a hat trick.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	A parade like you never saw, a funeral and a celebration, saying goodbye to one star, introducing a new one...playing those rubes dying to get a peek like he was rolling a coin over his finger tips... Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a
M	JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	It wasn't really Lucinda in there. It was Barbara in a fat suit and wig inside the hippo den. We buried the real Lucinda by the railroad tracks between towns. Cemeteries cost too much. We were the only family she knew. People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects...and
M	JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	August sure was right about Rosie. She pulled the people right in. Rosie played that crowd like a pro. The rubes love the exotic Rosie...kids run up to pet her with As Rosie passes, we see AN OLD WOMAN standing in front of her
F	JACOB	But as soon as the Spec started, we all knew it was too soon for Rosie's debut. Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins August stands beside with the bull hook. His face is cold and Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with the Others gasp at the near accident. August is already furious. Without missing a beat, Marlena yanks herself upright, beams Marlena grasps Rosie's halter as they fast approach the Jacob, August, the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she
F	MARLENA	Oh Jacob... August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of
F	JACOB	August, she's hurt. August takes her in his arms. Barbara appears to help.
M	AUGUST	I'm here, darling, I've got you.
F	BARBARA	Bring her to my tent, it's closer.
M	AUGUST	Jacob, send Joe for ice. You go and find that Goddamn bull before we're run out town. And take the hook! August is seething, his expression cold, as he carries
F	JACOB	I'm sorry ma'am. I'll get her.
M	OLD WOMAN	You better before she gets at my -- Rosie has helped herself to tomatoes. Jacob steps in.
F	JACOB	Rosie, no! Stop! Rosie pauses for a moment, flapping her ears at Jacob, then
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	Bad elephant, that's not nice. This kind lady hasn't invited you. She exits into the house as Rosie wraps her trunk around
F	JACOB	What's in the bucket?
M	GREG	Gin and ginger ale. Elephants love booze. One whiff of this and she's not thinking about cabbages no more. ... moj malutki paczuszek?
F	JACOB	Greg, right? Are you Polish?
M	GREG	Grabowski.
F	JACOB	Jankowski. Greg again pushes Rosie's trunk away from the bucket.
M	GREG	Last show I worked, one bull faked a belly ache just to get the whiskey...Better grab the hook.
F	JACOB	Are you a bull man? August would hire you in a minute.
M	GREG	Don't want the job. Not for him. Besides, I'm not bull man. I just like big beasts. Jacob gets it and follows Greg who carries the bucket.
M	GREG (CONT'D)	Is she following? Jacob turns around to see and sure enough: As Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses
F	JACOB	How's Marlena?
M	AUGUST	A little shaky. Sore wrists. Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be fine. Did you catch the bull?
F	JACOB	She's in the menagerie.
M	AUGUST	Good. August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold
F	JACOB	August! Wait! She was good! She came back on her own! Besides, you can't do anything now! The show is still going on. Good. The band will drown it out. Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a
M	MARLENA (O.S.)	Jacob! Jacob sees Marlena running towards him. August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with:
M	AUGUST	Get her out of here! NOW! Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this
F	JACOB	Rosie, what am I going to do with you? Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk Greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey. He
M	GREG	Here this will help. Poor beast. He really hurt her. Told you about him. Don't understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place. He shouldn't have the right, if you ask me. Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the
M	EARL'S MAN	Somebody better find Earl.
M	AUGUST (O.S.)	Marlena...! August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Do you know where Marlena is? Did she send you?
F	JACOB	No....What happened?
M	AUGUST	She won't speak to me... He can't finish. He sits, burying his head in his hands.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	...She won't let me apologize... She won't forgive me. Jacob is astounded by August's sad, pitiable state.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	I don't know what happens to me, Jacob. When I saw that bull running wild with Marlena, I...I lost my mind. But it's because I love her. Why can't she understand that? Isn't there anyone who understands? Ah, it's all my fault, I know it is. I've spent too much money on that bull. I can't pay the workmen. Our debts are piling. We're losing attendance at every show. I have no Star Attraction. I don't know what's going to happen to us if Rosie doesn't sell tickets. If I lose this circus, I'll lose Marlena - I know it. Jacob softens, seeing August in this helpless, humble light.
F	JACOB	I'm sure that's not true.
M	AUGUST	Maybe you can talk to her. She's tired of my apologies but, this pressure I'm under...Of course, that's no excuse for what I did... ...I can't believe what I did. Is she all right? The bull. Rosie.
F	JACOB	She'll be OK.
M	AUGUST	Would you tell Marlena? And tell her...tell her I'll do anything. Anything she wants.
F	JACOB	August, I can't... I'm sure she'll forgive you...She loves you...Anyone can see that. August wants to believe him. He seems more hopeful.
M	AUGUST	Thank you. My friend. Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused. As he exits;
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Jacob? Jacob stops and turns back as August asks: What were you planning to do with that bull hook? Jacob realizes he's holding the bull hook. August smiles.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Ha. You look like me. Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on Maybe there is someone who understands me. August smiles. But Jacob is unnerved by the smile...and the
M	EARL	What's going on?
M	AUGUST	Everything's fine, Earl. August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit.
F	JACOB	How's she doing?
M	GREG	Oh she's a strong one, this one. Jestes dobra dziewczynka Jacob watches as Rosie lifts her foot and Greg rubs ointment.
F	JACOB	Is she drunk? She's four tons..she'll just sleep good. Potoz noge. Jacob watches as Rosie puts her foot back on the ground.
M	GREG (CONT'D)	Masz, moja piekna Jacob watches as Greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a
F	JACOB	Oh my God...
F	JACOB	Just read those out loud. To Rosie. August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help...
M	AUGUST	Rosie...da--da---
F	JACOB	Daj.
M	AUGUST	Daj...daj..no-ge. Rosie does nothing. August looks to Jacob. Jacob is worried.
M	GREG	Might help if he said please.
F	JACOB	Say...Prosze Rosie daj noge.
M	AUGUST	Pros--Prozze Rosie...daj noge. Rosie lifts her foot. August's eyes gleam.
F	JACOB	Go on.
M	AUGUST	Rosie...potoz noge. Rosie puts her foot down. August starts to understand.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Do tylu, Rosie! Do tylu! Rosie sighs, shifts her weight, then takes a couple of steps
M	JACOB (V.O.)	That Fox Bros bull man didn't tell us was the elephant tramp who sold Rosie to them was Polish... August grabs Jacob and kisses him on the mouth.
M	AUGUST	We've got a new star! Greg remains cautious. Tables and U-shaped booths surround the dance floor. Tuxedoed August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth. They are drunk on Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides
M	AUGUST	Would you like to dance, darling?
F	MARLENA	No, thank you. Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks
M	AUGUST	We need more champagne.
F	JACOB	I'll get it.
M	AUGUST	No, you stay with Marlena. August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset.
F	JACOB	You ever going to let him off the hook?
F	MARLENA	Hook? That's an unfortunate choice of words.
F	JACOB	Rosie's going be great. He won't hurt her again. I know it.
F	MARLENA	Jacob, what you know about August is pretty much nothing. Jacob feels put down. Marlena realizes that came out too
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	You know how many star acts we've had? How much money we've made and lost and made...? Silver Star paid for our new stateroom and look what happened to him. Everything August touches gets fed to the cats one way or another. He'll never change. Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	I want to dance.
F	JACOB	Maybe you should wait for August.
F	MARLENA	I want to dance now! She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance - PANDEMONIUM: Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies. People
F	MARLENA	Lord, that was close...Aw, look at my stockings! And they're silk too.
F	JACOB	I wonder if August got out... Marlena looks up at Jacob and starts laughing hysterically,
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	...I don't know how we're going to get home. I've never been in New York, have you? Marlena's laughing subsides as she gets an idea.
F	MARLENA	I want to see the Empire State Building.
F	JACOB	What...what about August?
F	MARLENA	I don't know where he is, do you? And he doesn't know where we are. It's not our fault. Like you said, who knows how long it'll take us to get back. Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads;
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Just a few hours, Jacob. For just a few hours, we don't belong anywhere...we don't belong to anyone...Please. Jacob looks in her eyes and knows he shouldn't, but... I was doomed. He smiles. Marlena beams. They run off. Marlena and Jacob are looking out at the expansive 1931 view
F	MARLENA	I've never seen so far. Have you? Look at it. As far as the eye can see and it's nowhere near all that's out there. Jacob notices tears in her eyes.
F	JACOB	Are you all right? Yes. No. Yes, hahaha I'm fine. I'm a complete mess...ha...
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Sorry. But Jacob understands; He screams and Marlena joins in.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Jacob? I need you to do something for me. Promise me you will. Anything.
F	MARLENA	I want you to go. I want you get away from us, from the show. You're smart Jacob. You deserve better than us. Leave as soon as you can or something terrible's going to happen.
F	JACOB	Why are you saying this?
F	MARLENA	It's all right. No one can hear. We'll never get another chance to say it all. Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what Nothing can ever happen with us, you know. It's too dangerous. August will never let me go. You don't know what he's capable of.
F	JACOB	How can you be with a man you're frightened of?
F	MARLENA	I'm not. I don't have to feel afraid of him if I don't feel anything...After all these years, I've learned how to do it so well. I tell myself, "I'm managing. I can manage him. August loves me. Nobody else ever did. Who am I to say it's the wrong kind of love?" .. See, there's no place for a woman like me in any decent kind of world. You know where they found me when I was a baby? ... ...In an alley behind a whore house in Baltimore wrapped in newspaper. No one even bothered to leave a note...This circus, my horses - this is the only kind of life I can have. August made a woman like me a star attraction...I'm lucky. And I'm safe...And I was fine - before you came. Jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time...
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	There's nothing that can cause a woman so much trouble as a good man.
F	JACOB	I'm not that good. And I don't want to be.
F	MARLENA	Don't say that.
F	JACOB	No, I don't. Good men don't wind up with much in the end except their goodness. Isn't worth much, is it? See? ... Look what we've done to you already. She touches Jacob's face gently. Until this moment, they
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Sweet Jacob.
F	JACOB	You deserve as good a life any other girl.
F	MARLENA	Am I still a girl? I feel so old. They kiss. They stop and silently acknowledge where this is
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	This can only be tonight. We have to go back. Promise me you understand.
F	JACOB	I understand.
F	MARLENA	Promise me you'll suffer.
F	JACOB	I already am.
F	MARLENA	Promise you'll look in my eyes the whole time.
F	JACOB	I promise. Jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers...With
F	JACOB	If I had money, if I could take care of you, would we be going back?
F	MARLENA	You'd have to be a Rockefeller... August would find me. He always does.
F	JACOB	Have you tried to get away before?
F	MARLENA	Jacob you promised. You said you understood it was only tonight.
F	JACOB	I know. I do....I'm sorry.
F	MARLENA	Where were you when I was 17? Jacob smiles. They kiss not wanting to let go. Marlena pulls Jacob is asleep under Rosie when Walter wakes him up.
M	WALTER	Why are you sleeping here? Somebody's looking for you.
M	CAMEL	Hey kid. How nice to see ya.
F	JACOB	Hey, Camel. What's wrong?
M	CAMEL	I don't know, kid. Woke up a few days ago and my feet was all floppy. Jes can't feel'em right... ...It ain't just that though. It's other stuff too.
M	WALTER	Like down there...man stuff? Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly.
M	BILL	What's wrong with him, doc?
F	JACOB	I don't know.
M	WALTER	Jamaica ginger paralysis. Jake leg. I've seen it before.
M	CAMEL	No such thing. Is there Doc? Walter looks at Camel's empty "Jake" bottle.
M	WALTER	The manufacturer started putting this plasticizer in it, or something, to get around regulations that Jamaica ginger extract not be sold as booze. You're not supposed to drink this stuff, ya know.
M	CAMEL	Well what the hell am I supposed to drink to stop the shakes? It's Prohibition and I ain't no Astor.
M	GRADY	It's OK Camel. Tomorrow's payday. We'll get you some moonshine.
M	BILL	Grady don't lie to the man. If men were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't have tossed four of "em between Boonton and Weehawken.
F	JACOB	Four?...Will he get better? Walter looks at him, his expression says No.
M	BILL	We can't leave him here. They'll red light him for sure. Jacob understands. He gets an idea and turns to Walter.
F	JACOB	Walter, please. Blackie and his men only patrol the roustabout cars. They don't work the performer train. We can hide him easy until- Until when? What are we going to do with him? Shoot him like Silver Star? Because that's what he is Jacob. In a week, he won't be able to move his legs at all. He has a son in Pennsylvania. Near Reading. We're playing there in three weeks. That's all he needs. Walter doesn't want to do this, but clearly can't say no.
M	WALTER	I was right about you. You're going blow us all up...August got home tonight before you and Marlena. People are talking. Walter stalks off leaving Jacob unhinged by the news.
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	I shouldn't be a clown. I should be a Goddamn fortune teller. The other side of the curtain is filled with performers. The
F	JACOB	Good morning.
F	MARLENA	Good morning Jacob, how are you? Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the
F	JACOB	I wanted to, uh...Is there any chance I could speak with you alone?
F	MARLENA	About what? Is something wrong?
F	JACOB	No, I...I just wanted to...Walter said people are talking about what happened...last night... Oh Jacob, champagne completely overwhelms my senses..I always feel the better for it when I abstain. All I remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking. I don't even know how I got home. I don't remember a thing.
F	JACOB	Well, I want to apologize for--
F	MARLENA	Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to apologize for my torn stockings. You weren't even there. Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long
M	AUGUST	I slept like a baby after last night. Thank you my darling.
F	MARLENA	August, please. We're in public. Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated. Ah, nothing to be ashamed of. Man and wife reuniting in the most sacred of marriage places. My Marlena has forgiven me. All's well with the world again, right Jacob? That was quite an adventure last night. I'm glad I didn't have to bail you out. How did you get home?
F	JACOB	I don't know. I just ran. How did you two get separated? You were so close on the dance floor.
F	MARLENA	I told you, sweetheart. We got pushed apart by the crowd. This older married couple brought me to the ferry.
M	AUGUST	I'd like to look them up and invite them to the show free of charge...
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	...I'll even pay for their transportation. I'd pay it a hundred times over to anyone who helped my wife to safety. Thank goodness she had chaperones. If anyone had harmed her, or even touched her, there's no knowing what I might do. Jacob makes note of the implication. Marlena ignores it.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	...August said he would create an act for Marlena and Rosie that would have'em line up for miles... August and the company are delighted when Rosie lifts her
M	JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	His accent was awful but Rosie obeyed without fail. Marlena watches, full of excitement and praise for August. He Everyone cheers and applauds. Those near Jacob pat him on the
M	JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I was finally a part of them. Jacob and other performers watch anxiously. Will Rosie fail? August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again, August commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena with her trunk and
M	JACOB (V.O.)	August could have given Barnum a run for his money. He spent the payroll money on expensive posters promoting that act like it was bigger than Ringling. And we sold out every performance in every town... Marlena stops and wipes her brow, feigning exhaustion, and Rosie observes her with a smile and a raised trunk. Rosie The crowd screams with laughter. Marlena stands in mock outrage, wagging her finger at Rosie.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	In that center ring, Rosie became a guaranteed star attraction...
M	JACOB (V.O.)	Alone with me, telling her every thing I couldn't tell anyone else, she became the closest thing I had to family. Rosie, not to be out done (guided by August's Polish Marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg, The crowd explodes! August pretends to be outraged with
M	JACOB (V.O.)	And August! Ha, August was a new man..
M	JACOB (V.O.)	..treating everybody first class, spreading the word his Rosie act would finally get the men paid..
M	JACOB (V.O.)	..And with business so strong, nobody was worried about getting tossed, so we didn't have to worry so much about old Camel.
M	JACOB (V.O.).	And nothing was too good for Rosie. When August found out she liked gin and ginger ale, he made sure she got both every day, treating her like some favorite child... THE CROWD GOES WILD....August takes Marlena's hand and kisses But I didn't trust the new August. I kept waiting for the real one to show up. It was when I saw Rosie purring under his touch as if nothing had happened between them, that the worst thought occurred to me.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	Maybe, I was the man not to be trusted. Marlena moves to August's lap. They kiss...Jacob watches
M	JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Marlena looked happy...And it broke my heart. The circus is nothing without it's traditions..
M	AUGUST	..It's a family. And like any family, when a new member is born, it's arrival must be greeted with celebration and gratitude. Now, we've been a little busy with sold out performances, thank the Gods..
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	..but right now I want to take this moment before today's show to gather together..We close our eyes.. Everyone closes their eyes.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	..and we thank whoever's up there that sends desperate men running for the rails.. Everyone laughs.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	..because it was a lucky day when Jacob Jankowski jumped our train. Because of him - together with our beautiful Rosie and my beloved Marlena - we have the greatest star attraction in Benzini Brother's history. He found a way to save us all. And so, to officially welcome Jacob into the family, we open our eyes.. Everyone opens their eyes.
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	..And we give him the traditional Benzini Brothers baptism. August motions for Marlena, who retrieves a large mens
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	Now you don't have to borrow mine. Everyone applauds, hugging and kissing Jacob:
F	JACOB	Thank you, August.
M	AUGUST	It's from both of us. Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They
F	JACOB	Thank you, Marlena.
F	MARLENA	You're welcome, Jacob. As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding.
F	MARLENA	I wonder if you could help me.
F	JACOB	Sure. I've planned a surprise for August. He's been so wonderful, don't you think? Could you make sure Rosie is staked in my tent after the show?
F	JACOB	No problem.
F	MARLENA	Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm sure it would be nice for August if you were there too. Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think. Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace.
F	MARLENA	Oh, he'll be here any second. Jacob, can you open this for me? Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork.
F	JACOB	Rosie...get away....ssstop!! Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to
M	AUGUST (O.S.)	What is this? Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena
M	AUGUST	Did you show Jacob the opening night present I gave you? Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace.
F	MARLENA	Oh. No...Do you see Jacob?
F	JACOB	Beautiful.
M	AUGUST	It looks stunning on you. They kiss again. Marlena raises her glass of champagne.
F	MARLENA	To August - an authentic miracle man because he made a star attraction out of me.
F	JACOB	To August! August nods in gratitude. They tilt their glasses and drink.
M	AUGUST	Many thanks. Forgive me for arriving too soon and spoiling the surprise. August takes out a cigarette and lights it.
F	MARLENA	Don't be silly. I couldn't wait for you to come.
M	AUGUST	I could go back out to give you more time...or better yet, yell RAID and clear the place out so you two can be alone. In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present.
F	MARLENA	What?
M	AUGUST	I'm sorry. I'm probably wrong. I assumed that night after the RAID was the first time you two fucked, but obviously it's been going on longer than that.
F	MARLENA	Auggie, you're being silly.
M	AUGUST	Did you think I didn't know?
F	MARLENA	August don't do this!
M	AUGUST	Shut-up. SHUT UP! Marlena gets frightened. August saunters over to the silver
M	AUGUST (CONT'D)	How long did you think you could keep this from me?
F	MARLENA	August, please, there's nothing-
F	JACOB	We should go!
M	AUGUST	WE!...So you two are a couple?
F	JACOB	NO! I just don't think you're safe to be around a woman right now.
M	AUGUST	A woman? This is not a woman. This is my wife you Ivy League lying piece of shit! Say, I bet the authorities would like to know you practise without a license.
F	MARLENA	Auggie, please... Don't you see how much I love you?
M	AUGUST	I see you. I see you too clearly. Always have. I have to admit that was a nice touch when you got back from the speakeasy. Being with me in our bed, after being with him. Covering your tracks. I should have known a whore only performs for a man like that when she wants something.
F	JACOB	Marlena, come with me...
M	TRAMP!!	Marlena drops the fluted glasses, crying: Auggie? Are you all right now?... August looks at her. Marlena's expression is one of care and The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS. August's madness empowers him. He manages to overpower Jacob From inside the tent, they hear a crash. Marlena screams.
M	EARL	No he won't, kid. Come on. Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes
M	EARL (CONT'D)	See, it's over. Can we let you go? Jacob pants and nods. Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in
M	WALTER	Come on Jacob. Walk away. With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap
M	WALTER	The only thing that's keeping you alive right now are the rubes who saw everything. August can't risk getting rid of you here. But you better not get back on this train when we leave tomorrow night. What happened? Somebody turn me around. Share some of that jug!
M	WALTER	Shut-up Camel. Well, what the hell...! Camel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk Jesus Christ! Who did that to you?
M	WALTER	August. Is it true? Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth. He
F	JACOB	Why are we moving? We have a matinee tomorrow.
M	WALTER	Something's gone wrong. SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are
M	MARLENA (V.O.)	Jacob? Jacob, it's Marlena. They breath a sigh. Jacob opens the door to reveal.
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I told him I'm leaving him.
F	JACOB	My God. Are you all right?
F	MARLENA	Looks worse than it feels. Ha, look at the two of us. Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	Can I have a swig of that? Walter throws her the moonshine. Marlena drinks like a pro.
M	WALTER	Why is the train moving? Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking:
F	MARLENA	We're being run out. Apparently, August was so optimistic about money coming in for Rosie, he figured he'd double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job. Except, she... ...she was the police chief's wife. Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town. This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension. Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie:
M	WALTER	Aw girl. We're all in it now.
F	MARLENA	Why are you hiding that roustabout?
F	JACOB	Because Blackie and his men don't work the performer train and they'll red-light him if they find him. He can't work anymore.
F	MARLENA	My God. They come upon Silver Star's stall - empty - right before the
F	JACOB	Does August know where you are?
F	MARLENA	No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and the girls. He won't go there.
F	JACOB	He can't find you. As soon as we stop - before we stop - we'll jump off and I'll take you to a hotel in town.
F	MARLENA	And after that? August has all our money. Where will I go?
F	JACOB	Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll find a way together. I won't let you go back to him. I promise. Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	..I'll call my dean at Cornell..If I can take my finals again, get my degree, I can get my license. They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall. Moonlit through
F	MARLENA	Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful. You know, I bet Ringling would take us both then - they'd be getting a vet and a star attraction - that's a sweet deal for them. Although I won't be a star but I don't care. I'll take no billing at all...We'd be safe from August if we were with Ringling.
F	JACOB	Don't worry about him.
F	MARLENA	Of course, I'd have to wait a while until I can work again...
F	JACOB	What do you mean?
F	MARLENA	Jacob...I'm going to have a baby. Jacob is stunned...then confused... It's yours. Please don't ask me how I know...Is it all right? You can change your mind. I'd understand. Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all
F	JACOB	Change my mind??? Oh Marlena, please...please be happy.
F	MARLENA	I will...I promise...as soon as I stop being terrified. Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the
M	MARLENA (CONT'D)	I'm so tired.
F	JACOB	Rest...I've got you now. Marlena tries, closing her eyes.....Then, without warning; He stumbles and falls. He rises and fumbles forward...using Jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can Nell quickly brings Barbara to the window. Barbara sees Jacob Camera tracks Barbara and the girls through the windows, as
F	BARBARA	Poor Kid...Help me with him..
F	JACOB	Don't you work the matinee?
M	TATTOOED MAN	Not today. I'm fading. I gotta re- ink.
F	BARBARA	Don't talk. Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off.
F	JACOB	Marlena!!
M	WALTER	Sshh. Lie back.
F	JACOB	Where is she? Did he hurt her?
M	WALTER	I don't know. Your pupils are two different sizes. Jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins.
F	JACOB	I have to get Marlena. What if he--
M	WALTER	Jacob, look at me. You've got a concussion and you're on a moving train. There's nothing you can do. Marlena can handle him. She's done it for years...
F	JACOB	I have to get her.
M	WALTER	Jacob, you can't.
F	JACOB	She's going to have a baby. Walter is stopped. Camel shakes his head.
M	WALTER	Does August know? What have you done to us?
F	JACOB	We're going to Ringling. Me, Marlena. You can too.
M	WALTER	I'm a fifth rate clown when second rate circuses are folding all over the place. Doesn't put me on top of Ringling's list. They've got a dozen of me in the wings. I couldn't even go if I wanted to. August won't pay anyone. Says the show's debts have to come first. First time in Benzini Bros history performers haven't been paid. People are starving out there, Jacob. In the United States of America. Starving. Where am I going to go?
M	CAMEL	What about family? Like my son. Gotta have somebody...a mother.
M	WALTER	Not a woman I have any use for. She's sold me to this outfit when I was 13.
M	CAMEL	She sold you?
M	WALTER	I'm not exactly cut out for farm work. Don't worry about me..
M	WALTER (CONT'D)	..If you and Marlena go, if August doesn't kill you first - I'll know what to do...I'll tell August how well I got to know you and how I can help him find you. Might even get myself a better room out of the bargain... It won't be anything personal, you understand. Beat. Each wants the other to survive at any cost.
F	JACOB	Do whatever you have to, Walter.
M	WALTER	You too, Jacob. They exchange a final look, which is a goodbye. Walter turns
M	CAMEL	Ya poor kid. The night this train passed ya...you shoulda kept on running, I guess. He removes the knife from his mouth, having cut his lip. He August is asleep on his side, his arms locked around Marlena, Jacob and Marlena's eyes meet. She sees the knife in his hand Jacob steps forward, raising the knife. His hands tremble. Defeated, Jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head. Marlena
F	JACOB	Walter? Camel? Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted.
M	WALTER! CAMEL!!	He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	No..no..no..no....!!!! With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he
M	JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I wanted to believe taking Walter's knife didn't make a difference. But still. I left him without a fighting chance. Maybe they survived. Maybe they were tossed over grassy land...I couldn't let myself believe what I already knew. Jacob falls apart, crying without shame.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	I waited almost til matinee time so I could let myself be seen by as many people from town. As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg
F	JACOB	I'm not here to cause any trouble. I'm leaving.
M	AUGUST	Funny, I thought you already left.
F	JACOB	I'd like to say goodbye. To the menagerie. Just a few minutes and then I'll go. August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	There's nothing more you can do to me. Killing me'll be more trouble than it's worth, now that the rubes have seen me. You were right about me from the start August, when you said I wouldn't last...I can't survive here... I am nothing. August feels victorious and therefore benevolent.
M	AUGUST	Earl, take him to the menagerie. Thirty seconds. Then escort him out of my circus, into Altoona. And if he comes back, you can shoot him, as that is within our lawful rights with regards to trespassers. August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at
M	EARL	Come on kid. When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens:
M	EARL	It's good you're going. They must have known you got back on the train last night. He tossed more than half a dozen working men.
M	EARL (CONT'D)	Kinkers never get tossed. Never. So that was meant for you. We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top.
M	EARL (CONT'D)	A few of the guys that got tossed caught up with us again.
F	JACOB	Walter! Is he---? Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news.
M	EARL	Keep walking...They got tossed off the trestle, if you can believe it. Camel's head hit the rocks. He died right away... Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl
M	EARL (CONT'D)	...Walter...Walter's legs were smashed up real bad..They had to leave him. They don't reckon he lasted the night. Jacob is in shock. He can barely walk on...
M	EARL (CONT'D)	The ones that came back...Bill... Grady.. I don't know how but, one way or another they're taking down August tonight. Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl.
F	JACOB	Why are you telling me? Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these Earl shifts his focus - he's alarmed. Earl, what was that? All the performers and work men on the midway are on alert.
M	EARL	Oh Christ! Oh Shit... Earl runs back towards the Big Top.
F	JACOB	What is it?
M	EARL	The Disaster March! Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg Jacob is scanning the tent for Marlena when: Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink
M	MARLENA!	Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY, AMIDST THE STAMPEDE. Like But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do.

M	JACOB (V.O.)	It took days to round them up. Some we never did get back.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	I don't know who was more scared - the rubes or the animals.
M	JACOB (V.O.)	When the Nesci Bros. Circus showed, we were officially belly up. A MAN SCREAMS after unrolling a canvas and making a discovery
M	SHERIFF	...These animals are now the property of Altoona and we're here to sell them to Mr. Nesci.
F	JACOB	Not all of them! Some of these animals are mine, like this bull.
M	DICK NESCI	Do you have any proof? Jacob is stalled. Greg appears.
M	GREG	He's right. He's just an elephant tramp. The bull is his.
F	JACOB	You don't want her anyway. She can't do anything. Dumb as a box of peanut shells. Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie.
M	DICK NESCI	What's her name?
F	JACOB	Gertrude. Jacob and Rosie exchange eye contact. Nesci is skeptical.
M	DICK NESCI	Gertrude! Gertrude, step up! UP! Rosie blows and swings her trunk, throwing dirt across the Dick Nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg,
F	MARLENA	What happens now?
F	JACOB	I wish I knew. Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms. It's over.
F	JACOB	I convinced my dean to let me take my finals. Marlena was right. With my degree, our animals and Marlena's acts, Ringling got a sweet deal. Our son was born our first season. We named him Walter. He spent the first seven years of his life with Ringling. That's why I...I just can't understand how he forgot to show up today. There was a circus in town. Charlie understands. He looks affectionately at Jacob.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	By the time our third son came, we'd had enough. Rosie was tired. Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo dropped dead, so I got the job.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	We bought some property so we could keep the horses...Rosie...then five kids...Bobo and that Orangutan...Never named that Orangutan. Nothing ever sounded.. elegant enough for her. Just called her Ma'am. Man oh man that was...that was a life, boy, I'll tell ya... Charlie smiles, appreciating this old man's big life.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	And then before you know it, the kids are borrowing the car and moving out. Marlena and I on our own again...until she passed. This moment causes Jacob to pause. He still loves her.
M	JACOB (CONT'D)	I never told Marlena it was Rosie who got August. I didn't want her to know. When Rosie passed on, she cried for days. I owe that bull my whole life...my kids, everything.. A KNOCK. Charlie peeks through the window and sees a COP:
M	CHARLIE	It's the heat.
F	JACOB	They're here for me. Charlie and Jacob exchange a look. Charlie understands.
M	CHARLIE	Hi Officer, can I help you?
M	COP	Yes, I'm hoping you can. An elderly gentleman went missing from the nursing home down the street. Staff seems to think he came here.
M	CHARLIE	We had a lot of folks from the home today. But no, I haven't seen him. The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob.
M	COP	Excuse me, but who is that?
M	CHARLIE	Oh....that's my Dad. The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:
M	CHARLIE (CONT'D)	He can't talk. Had a major stroke a few years back. But he's doing well. Ain't ya Pop? Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a
M	COP	OK, well, thanks for your time. Here's my number in case you hear of anything. Sorry to bother you. The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They
F	JACOB	You sure about this? Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:
M	CHARLIE	I wonder if we can get you into the book of records. "Oldest man who ever ran away with the circus".
F	JACOB	Nah, I'm not running away. Just coming home. He comes to an ORANGUTAN...younger than the one from his The Orangutan studies him for a moment. Judging. Jacob's fingers entwine around the Orangutan's hand. They
F	JACOB	Thank you, Ma'am.
