M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	ROGER LEMKE (V.O.)	The Brown River Valley: It's where we work. It's where we play. It's where we live. But even here in paradise, accidents can happen.
M	ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D)	At Northlands Insurance, our goal is to provide high quality insurance services and related products to businesses and individuals in Wisconsin's Northlands. I'm Roger Lemke. Not only do I care about you, we also endeavor to give you the coverage you need at the best prices around. It's that reason Northlands has been awarded the prestigious Two Diamond Award from the American Society of Mutual Insurers three years running. Because at Northlands Insurance, we insure your dreams.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Ho-lee Christmas, knocked her outta the park, Roger! Out of the G-D park, you sonofagun! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	ROGER LEMKE	Hell, I'm just a pretty face, Bill. That copy was all you. Do got one little gripe though, boss-- if you'd waited until after Cedar Rapids we could've said winner of the Two Diamonds four years running!
M	BILL KROGSTAD ROGER LEMKE	Aroo-aroo! Two Diamonds! Two Diamonds!
M	GWEN LEMKE	So proud of you, Roggie. God, you rock. Doesn't your dad rock, boys?!
M	ROGER LEMKE	Thank you. Thank you very much!
M	ROGER LEMKE (CONT'D)	Tim! Timmy Lippe! Didn't even know you were here. You see it, bud?
M	TIM	Oh, heck yeah. You were awesome.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Just super... super awesome. Man.
M	ROGER LEMKE	Y'know what Tim, I want people to see the insurance game for what it really is-- it's a noble field. I believe that. Like I say, we're not just insuring vehicles and homes and that. Hell no. We're insuring people's dreams.
M	TIM	Oh. Yeah. I say that, too... sometimes. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	ROGER LEMKE	Well shit, you do, don't you? By god, I stole your line! Knew I'd heard that somewhere!
M	TIM	Oh, no biggie...
M	ROGER LEMKE	Bummer they cut your little deal outta the ad, though.
M	TIM	Ach. Y'know. Got left on the ol'...
M	FEMALE CO-WORKER	Roger! Look out Brad Pitt!
M	TIM	The ol' cutting room floor, right? Brad Pitt. Ha. That's... Whoa. Cake. Cool.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	So awesome. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	There she is! How you feeling?
M	MILLIE	Oh, it's no big whoop.
M	TIM	Ta-da. Quack, quack. D'you already have this guy? Wasn't sure. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	MILLIE	Gayle Syrstäd gave me a Quackers for Secret Santa last year. I can probably trade with Nan, though.
M	MILLIE (CONT'D)	Cute. Brandy would never sit still long enough for me to dress her up like that. Tell you that right now. You didn't have to do this whole rigmarole, Tim. I told you it's just a little diarrhea.
M	TIM	I know. But for you to miss a day of school, Millie... I can't remember you ever calling in sick when I had you.
M	MILLIE	Well I wasn't going through menopause when you were in middle school now was I?
M	TIM	Negative. Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	So. Does your tummy feel good enough to...? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	I can try and... hold it, Mil. Can you...?
M	MILLIE	Bring it home. Bring it home.
M	TIM	I'm bringing it. Bringing it! Bringing it! D'aaaarrgho'awesome...
M	TIM	Ooh, you make me live! You're my best friend!
M	MILLIE	C'mon Tim, I can't hear.
M	TIM	Sorry. But you are, babygirl. You're my best friend.
M	MILLIE	Tss. Goofball.
M	MILLIE (CONT'D)	Y'know Galen and Dar Krause just did a cruise to the Bahamas? Pretty reasonable they said, price-wise.
M	TIM	Ya mon, Bahama-mama.
M	MILLIE	It's a little different I suppose-- a cruise. But... Look, I'm not gonna shilly-shally around here, Tim. I found a river cruise through Germany-- Viking Line, real grade-A. It's what I want. For the honeymoon.
M	TIM	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait... Where's this coming from? We agreed on Wisconsin Dells for the honeymoon. It's what we agreed on.
M	MILLIE	You've been to the Dells two dozen times...
M	TIM	So? Roger and Gwen Lemke go to the Dells every year...
M	MILLIE	Because they have children. Water parks are for children...
M	TIM	Hello, Tommy Bartlett's Ski, Sky and Stage Show? It's not just a water park...
M	MILLIE	Timothy, settle. You've never even left the state of Wisconsin. Barely left Brown Valley...
M	TIM	What's so great about...? You're not... You're missing the... We agreed on the Dells.
M	MILLIE	God rest her. Your mom was my best friend. But it's going on 20 years now. You gotta grow up. You gotta let go. You gotta live a life here. See?
M	TIM	I'm living a perfectly fine life. I don't know why you'd want to... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 rock the waters or whatever. Ridiculous.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	We agreed on the Dells.
M	TIM	Hello... Oh, hey Bill...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Aw jeez. Oh my gosh. No...
M	WADE	Guy had it all. Everything you'd ever want. Y'know he flew a Cessna? In his spare time?
M	MILLIE	I always say people like that-- who live fast? They die hard. Look at River Phoenix.
M	WADE	Everything you'd ever want.
M	MILLIE	I just don't know. To do those things to yourself. Just perverted. Who ever heard of such a thing? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	I'm... Gwen, I'm so sorry. Roger is-- was-- is-- a personal hero to me. He just... he had it all. If there's... I'm...
F	PAM	You just don't get it, Kurt...
M	KURT	Aw Christ, Pammy...
M	TIM	Hang on guys, how's this sound-- you can both be right. I know you're probably thinking, "Oh, an umbrella policy's only for rich people." You know what I say to that? Bull roar. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Pam, Kurt-- I've known you guys since you were little kids. So let's don't think of me as an "insurance salesman." Think of me as your friend who just wants to help you protect your dreams...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	I'm... Excuse me a sec... D'you-- can I get you a napkin or something, Bill? For that?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Know how Roger used to get down there to Cedar Rapids? To the ASMI Convention? Any idea?
M	TIM	Um. I'm with Kurt and Pam Gambsky...
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Flew himself. In a Cessna. Pilot. It was all worked out. I was going to ease into retirement in July while Roger transitioned into his ownership role.
M	TIM	Wait, Roger was going to buy Northlands?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	All worked out. Shit, Dione already put the down payment on a time share. Branson, Black Hills. Florida. Units all over the place.
M	TIM	Holy cow. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Yeah, whole deal. Now? Now I got my back up against Christ-knows-what. No Lemke, no buyer, the wife's spending like we won the goddamn Powerball. And what's worse, because of the way, y'know, the way Roger passed...
M	TIM	The... belt and the lederhosen...?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Quote-unquote perverted, they're saying. Like Northlands has some kind of stain. Oh, I'm so goddamned tired...
M	TIM	Is there...? Can I do anything to help, or...?
M	TIM (CONT'D)	"Innovations in Hog Farm Risk Mitigation." Roger's Two Diamond presentation for the ASMI Convention. I helped prepare it.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	We need those Two Diamonds more than ever, Tim. If I'm going to sell this company, we need people to feel OK about the Northlands brand.
M	TIM	Mm.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	I'd go myself but my daughter Kayla, the heavy one? She unearthed some Polack to marry her. I'm locked into that wedding over in Gladstone. No flex. Locked in. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Whoa-whoa-wait. What are you saying?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	I'm not asking you to fill Roger Lemke's shoes. Not gonna happen. I'm asking you to deliver his presentation-- to bring me home those Two Diamonds.
M	TIM	I can't go to ASMI. To Iowa. To Cedar Rapids, Iowa... Why can't Lila do it?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	C'mon Tim. Lila's about as charismatic as a bag of hair.
M	TIM	Bill, I've never... I mean, I've dabbled in hog farm risk mitigation, but I'm no pro...
M	BILL KROGSTAD	You were what, 16, when I gave you that filing job? Right after your mom passed? Raising yourself pretty much, living all alone. And I'm thinking, now here's a kid. Here's a kid who's gonna go places. And then, somehow, you kind of just didn't. Now, I guess it makes some sense-- a child loses both parents at an early age, becomes what you might call stunted. But cripes almighty, do you want to just sit there in your folks old house, just rot away in Brown Valley dating that... ... woman the rest of your life?
M	TIM	Millie and I are getting married.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Tss, maybe three'll be a charm. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Point is, I'm not exactly dancing in the streets here Tim, but it's a perception thing. You go down there to Cedar Rapids, wholesome and pie- eyed and all that. You show them that Northlands is a good outfit-- an upstanding Christian outfit...
M	BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)	Aw cripes, say you'll do it. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	WADE	Oh, hiya Tim.
M	TIM	Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...?
M	MILLIE	Hi Tim. Wade's cable's down.
M	TIM	It's six AM...?
M	WADE	Mike & Mike in the Morning. ESPN 2.
M	TIM	Oh yeah. Those guys. Hilarious. Ha.
M	WADE	Mm.
M	TIM	Well I just wanted to...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Oh shoot. You already have a Strut the Rooster...
M	MILLIE	So this is it then? Tim's jetting off to Cedar Rapids this morning, Wade. Big deal insurance convention. Iowa.
M	WADE	That right?
M	TIM	It's only four days. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 MILLIE Won't go to Germany for our honeymoon, but for work you can just gallivant around like Tom Petty or one of them?
M	TIM	We agreed on the Dells... Should we maybe talk in the...?
M	WADE	Oh it don't bother me.
M	TIM	If I don't try to do this, it's not just my job, Mil. There are four other employees whose lives are on the line. Plus Carol, who does part time seasonal work. So.
M	MILLIE	It's not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on.
M	TIM	No, Bill said he'd make that part of any deal...
M	MILLIE	Believe you me, Bill Krogstad is looking out for one guy. And that's Bill Krogstad.
M	WADE	Krogstad.
M	TIM	It's... Oh, who am I kidding, I'm a little scared here. A lot scared. But not about us. What we've got-- we're like lightning in a bottle, babygirl. I love you so much, Mil.
M	MILLIE	I want you to be very careful. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	I know. I will. I mean, Cedar Rapids-- there were only four homicides last year. For a city of 122-thousand that's pretty darn good. The forcible rape numbers are admittedly a bit higher, but...
M	MILLIE	I want you to check in with me.
M	TIM	I will every day. Twice a day.
M	MILLIE	Make it three times.
M	TIM	OK, three times! Sheesh. And I'll send a stinkin' telegram, too.
M	RETARDED MAN	Airport don't open for two hours.
M	TIM	Thanks! Just wanna be sure I make my flight. Going down to Cedar Rapids. The big ASMI Convention? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Cold enough for you? I'm heading to Cedar Rapids. Supposed to be up in the mid-30s down there. S-weet!
M	TSA AGENT	Any liquids, gels or aerosols must be placed in a quart-size Zip-Lock. Laptop computers must be taken out of the case and placed in...
M	TIM	Whoa... what's all this now?
M	TSA AGENT	Any liquids, gels or aerosols... Tim! Praise Christ you haven't left yet.
M	TIM	Hey Bill, what's going on?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Can't believe I forgot to get this to you. Hang on, lemme...
M	BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)	It's basically an ASMI Convention Bible. It's going to tell you who to talk to, who to avoid, how best to fellowship and network...
M	TIM	Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Ziegler is a cancer. Sonofabitch called one of Lemke's biggest clients-- Joyce Armbrüster? Smeared Roger's name and the Northlands' name. Frickin' poacher. Avoid Ziegler like the plague. The fella I got you rooming with, Ronald Wilkes-- that's who you stick by. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 By Ziegler's name, Tim frantically writes, "Poacher" and
M	BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)	You got the presentation, right?
M	TIM	Affirmative.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	On me at all times. Plus three back- up discs.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Hey-hey! That kind of prep is pure Lemke! Didn't know any better, I'd say Roger's spirit had kind of climbed into you, just planted its seed inside you there. Atta boy!
M	TIM	Bill... I have to ask. Let's say one of these big dogs-- your Allstates, your Prudentials-- does decide to go and buy Northlands...?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Said it before, I'll say it again: Your job, the office in Brown Valley-- all safe. What you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can. That's all you need to worry about.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	You lucky ducks are obviously seated in an exit row. Score! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Just gotta make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation...
M	TIM	You're talking what, water landing? Terror type deal? Terrorists...?
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	It's really just a formality.
M	TIM	Believe it or not, I have actually never been on an airplane before.
M	FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Oh, well you'll do awesome.
M	TIM	OK. If you need any help, I'm in.
M	TIM	Tim Lippe.
M	MAN	Ah. David Marinakis.
M	TIM	Great to meet you, Dave. Wondering, what kind of name is Marinakis?
M	DAVID MARINAKIS	Greek. It's Greek.
M	TIM	Marinakis. OK. Mine's German. Lippe. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 As in, "Don't you get lippy with me, mister." My grandma used to say that. Before she passed. Lot of people pronounce it lip. Course the high German's probably more like lipp-uh.
M	TIM	Like I say, Dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance.
M	DAVID MARINAKIS	It's a good way of looking at it.
M	TIM	I think so.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Let me know how things go with your Alltel deal, Dave. E-mail me.
M	DAVID MARINAKIS	Will do, Tim. Thanks.
M	TIM	Hello. Score! Holy crap. Awesome.
F	BREE	Hey man, can I bum a heater?
M	TIM	What's that now?
F	BREE	A cigarette?
M	TIM	Oh, I'm like, "this gal wants to borrow my heater?" Tss. But no, sorry, can't help you there.
F	BREE	You here for the convention?
M	TIM	You bet. Tim Lippe. Northlands Insurance. How `bout yourself?
F	BREE	Ah, Bree. I'm Bree.
M	TIM	Well Bree, it's nice to meet you. But let me give you a trade secret. Keep smoking and your premiums will go through the roof.
F	BREE	Thanks Mr. Surgeon General. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 If you want to party, Tim, let me know. I'll be around.
M	TIM	You bet. Party hearty. Nice chatting with you, Bree.
M	TRENT	Checking in with us, sir?
M	TIM	You tell me. Never done the hotel deal before.
M	TRENT	Well, welcome. I'll just need to see a credit card for the incidentals...
M	TIM	Trent, I was given the impression that you honored traveler's checks.
M	TRENT	Yes, we just need an imprint of your card. For the incidentals.
M	TIM	Traveler's check is a fully insured method of, y'know. 100 percent.
M	TRENT	I'm aware of that, sir. We won't charge the card unless you rent a movie or take something from the mini-bar...
M	TIM	I'm a non-drinker.
M	TRENT	It's standard, sir. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Have you seen the pool yet?
M	TIM	Not yet, but I can smell it. The chlorine. It's a super top-notch place, Mil. You'd be blown away. Oop, 321. I'm at mi casa. Just a... lemme see how this deal works.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Key's like a stinkin' credit card.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	What? What happened?
M	TIM	Oh jeez. I'm sorry. I'm... Please. There's an Afro-American gentleman in this room.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Well get the heck outta there!
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	Tim! Run like hell, Tim!
M	BLACK MAN	Are you Tim? Tim Lippe?
M	BLACK MAN (CONT'D)	I'm Ronald Wilkes. Bill Krogstad said we were gonna be roommates? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Tim! Tim! Tiiim!
M	TIM	Let me call you back, Mil.
M	RONALD	You are Tim...?
M	TIM	Um. Yeah. Yes. You bet. For a minute there I was like, whoa, I'm gonna be robbed here, or...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	It's super... just super great to meet you, Ronald.
M	RONALD	OK. You want to check out the room then?
M	TIM	Check out these digs. Huzzah!
M	RONALD	Yeah, you could do a lot worse. Look Tim, I gotta put the cards on the table here. The reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked-- wedding or some such. Point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. Now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 But if you've got any qualms, I hear you L & C, that's Loud & Clear.
M	TIM	No. I'm down. Down with that. Heck yeah. Any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate-wise?
M	RONALD	No. Just hope he doesn't snore.
M	TIM	Can you imagine? Or someone who has terrible gas?! Like, pull my finger. Brrump! Hello, no thanks!
M	RONALD	This isn't Woodstock, Tim. It's a regional insurance convention. Whoever it is, I'm sure he'll be a straight shooter.
M	MAN (O.S.)	Hey Taco Bill, am I gonna see you at Horizons tonight? I hear they got their all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet going! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 So far it's just the one billboard north of St. Cloud. Course the traffic load would get me more eyeballs in the Twin Cities corridor, but at the end of the day, it's N-T- S. Not Too Shabby.
M	TIM	Ha. N-T-S. That's hilarious. I'd love to own my own agency...
M	DEAN	Baroo-baroo, let's get this party started you mother-rubbers!
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Ronald Wilkes! No fucking way! The Ronimal! Gimme some love-uh, my soul broth-uh!
M	RONALD	Turn down the volume, Ziegler. You just got here, for Pete's sake.
M	DEAN	What's the matter, friend, never seen a chocolate-vanilla love sandwich?! Wait until later when we get to the buttfucking! Nah, I'm having fun. Dean Ziegler. Stevens Point, Wisconsin.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Don't worry, I won't bite. I'm medicated. Not really. But I should be. Right Ronimal? So what's your handle pal? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	RONALD	We drew the short straw with this pitiful reprobate, Tim. Dean, this is Tim Lippe.
M	DEAN	Call me Deanzie. Where you hail from, Tim Lippe? Quiet-land?
M	TIM	No. I do not. I'm down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Northlands Insurance.
M	DEAN	Bill Krogstad's outfit. The Krogger! Aw shit. I was sorry as hell to hear about Lemke's passing up there. That guy was tits as a rep. Course he thought I was a big, loud asshole-- s'pose he wasn't too far off there. No boy, a real tragedy.
M	TIM	Uh, thanks. Thank you. It's... Roger was just a super great man.
M	DEAN	Amen. He'll be in my prayers. His family, too. Tragedy.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Well. I don't know about you wingnuts, but the Deanzie could use a drinkzie. What say we blow off the welcome hoo-ha and hit Horizons for happy hour. Two-for-one cocktails, 10 cent wings, and an all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet!
M	RONALD	That line was unappealing last year, Dean. It remains so now.
M	TIM	I'm planning to watch President Helgesson's opening remarks. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	DEAN	Oh, don't get me started on that smug fuck. Orin Helgesson is a-- pardon my French-- a cunt. Just a steaming wet dog cunt.
M	RONALD	No one's buying the potty-mouth nonsense you're selling, Dean. Tim, you'll learn to ignore this degenerate before too long. Let's go hear what Orin has to say.
M	DEAN	Fine. Have fun ladies... Not.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Party time. Excellent.
M	ORIN	I'm Orin Helgesson, your ASMI Midwest Region Chapter President. But I'm not going to make you play Hail to the Chief. Not yet anyhow.
M	ORIN (CONT'D)	Seriously, we've got a great line- up for ASMI `09, with our forward- looking theme, Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century! Just so many innovations-- our newsletter, The ASMI-teer is now fully digital. So a lot of our breakout sessions will be dealing with this kind of "E- Commerce" sort of thing. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 If you didn't pick up your Welcome Kits, be sure and see Mike Pyle, the gentleman in the-- what color's that sweater vest Mike?
M	MIKE PYLE	Beige.
M	ORIN	In the beige sweater vest. Great.
M	TIM	I'm worried about this Deanzie guy. Bill Krogstad told me specifically to stay the heck away from him.
M	RONALD	Oh, Dean ran for President against Orin last year-- only got four votes. He's running again this year. He's just full of bluster.
M	ORIN	... The Two Diamonds are given every year to the agency that best exemplifies the ASMI decree: "To provide high quality insurance services and related products while maintaining Commitment to Community, Country and God." We have a record number of entries this year-- over 15 agencies competing. Good luck to you all.
M	TIM	Did he say over 15 agencies?
M	RONALD	Yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year. I brought my A-game though.
M	TIM	You're competing? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	RONALD	Heck yeah. It's the first year I've ever had a real shot. But the guy you really have to worry about is Mike Pyle. He owns the sixth largest Allstate agency in the Upper Midwest. The guy's a shark.
M	ORIN	... moment of silence for the man many considered to be the Michael Jordan of Mutual Insurance Agents. Roger Lemke.
M	ORIN (CONT'D)	Were you there when they crucified my Lord? Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
M	TIM	I need to talk to you, Mil. I'm in over my head here. I feel like I can't even swim. It was fun at first, but now it's like, I dunno. I need you so bad, babygirl...
M	WADE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Millie's in the john.
M	TIM	Who's...? Wade?
M	WADE (O.S. ON PHONE)	You bet. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Are...? You're at Millie's still?
M	WADE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Badger hockey's on. My cable's out. You want her to give you a ring when she's off the john?
M	TIM	Um. Yes, please. And just, would you tell her I love her very much. You got it, bud.
M	WOMAN	You were checking me out.
M	WOMAN (CONT'D)	I'm gonna have to tell the hotel there's a pervo in the fitness center hitting on innocent women.
M	TIM	I... Ma'am, no. I'm sorry if you... I wouldn't... I have a fiancé!
M	WOMAN	Unbelievable. That poor woman should know what you're up to.
M	TIM	No, no, no, please. I didn't... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	WOMAN	I am so sorry. I'm totally messing with you. God, I'm a jerk.
M	TIM	Ha. OK. That was different. Ha. Yes. Yes you are. A real... jerkhead.
M	WOMAN	I'm so sorry. Joan Ostrowski-Fox.
M	TIM	Tim Lippe.
F	JOAN	Don't get lippy with me, mister.
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	So do you play professional basketball, Tim? Because that's a pretty updated uniform there.
M	TIM	No I don't. I'm actually in town for the ASMI convention.
F	JOAN	Oh, is that where a bunch of guys sit around a table looking up the word "gullible" in a dictionary?
M	TIM	No, it's an association of insur... Oh. You're screwing with me again.
F	JOAN	Indeed I am. I'm here for ASMI, too. In from Oh-my-god, Nebraska. Just kidding-- Omaha. Ugh, I am gross, so I'm going to bid you farewell, Tim Lippe. See you at Horizons tonight?
M	TIM	Um. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	Unless you were planning on spying on me in the shower.
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	God, I am evil. I need help.
M	ORIN	How ya doin'?
M	TIM	Oh. I... OK. I... I really enjoyed your speech, President Helgesson.
M	ORIN	You were in there? Marvelous. Did you like the part about E-Commerce?
M	TIM	You bet. Very much, sir.
M	ORIN	Terrific. It's the future y'know. Anyhow, I don't think we've...
M	TIM	Tim Lippe. Down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Northlands Insurance?
M	ORIN	Whew boy. Tim, what can I say? I just-- we're all feeling it. I'm so sorry for the loss... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Um, well, it's rough. Real rough. Like you said in your remarks, Roger wasn't just a great rep, he was a good father and...
M	ORIN	And a pilot. Flew a Cessna.
M	TIM	Yeah. It's just rough.
M	ORIN	Come here, son.
M	TIM	Thank you.
M	ORIN	Tim, I know Bill's looking to retire and from the sound of it he's on the hook for a pretty sweet time share.
M	TIM	Yeah, it sounds pretty top-notch.
M	ORIN	I want to help him find a buyer, and God knows I'll try my darnedest. But-- and it pains me to say this-- there's a petition going around trying to rescind all of Northlands' Two Diamond Awards.
M	TIM	What?!
M	ORIN	I know. But let's be honest, one of the core tenets of the Two Diamonds is Commitment to God. And the way Roger passed on... well, some folks are saying that type of activity isn't entirely "godly." Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 You have to understand, this isn't some namby-pamby local event. This is a regional convention, Tim. Now, I want to help you, but you're going to have to help yourself too.
M	ORIN (CONT'D)	Let me give you a few extra drink coupons for Horizons. Get down there-- fellowship and network. Buy a few drinks. Let `em see the good side of Northlands Insurance-- the wholesome side, OK?
M	TIM	Thank you President Helgesson.
M	ORIN	Please. Orin. And if you need anything, Tim-- I mean anything-- I'm up in the Tiffany Suite. Room 411. Balcony overlooks the pool.
M	DEAN (O.S.)	Timbo! Over here roomie!
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	How's she hanging Big Tim? Big time Big Tim...
M	TIM	Hello Dean.
M	DEAN	It's Deanzie, c'mon. Ahoy Cap'n, we got a thirsty sailor over here! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Kid was in the navy. Seaman.
M	BARTENDER	What can I getcha?
M	TIM	Ah. Do you guys have root beer?
M	DEAN	You want a nipple with that?
M	TIM	Ah, why would I need a nipple...?
M	DEAN	Ach, I'm busting your balls. You don't get out much, do you buddy? Whoa, who'd you have to blow to get all those?
M	TIM	I didn't... Nobody. President Helgesson gave them to me.
M	DEAN	Smug fuck. Trying to poison my roommate with his B-S propaganda.
M	TIM	I really don't... Orin, President Helgesson, he wanted to help me meet people. Just being friendly.
M	DEAN	Wow-wow-wow, you are naïve. A rail cocktail's, what, four bucks? Times that by 10 drink coupons. We're talking 40 large, Tim. Doesn't sound so friendly anymore, does it? Sounds more like one of these I-scratch- your-back-you-scratch-mine deals. I bet ol' Orin invited you up to the Tiffany Suite, too, hmm? Fourth floor? View of the pool? Yup. Cocksucker's buying your vote, pal. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Ronimal! Taco Bill! Over here! Bill Hernandez. I call him Taco Bill. Mexican.
M	DEAN	for pussy-wise here in Cedar CRAPids?
M	TIM	Ah, that would be nothing...
M	DEAN	That your mom?
M	TIM	No. No it is not. Millie and I are engaged. To be married.
M	RONALD	You're married yourself, Ziegler. The heck's your moral compass?
M	DEAN	My moral compass is pointing true north, if you read me. Right Taco Bill?
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	And by the way, Ronimal-- I was married. Was.
M	RONALD	Oh jeez. You and Patti split? Sorry to hear that.
M	DEAN	Ah, she's a fucking asshole. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Together 17 years. Lucky if one of `em was decent. ASS. FUCKING. HOLE.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	What I was talking about anyway, Ronimal, is that from what I can deduce, young Timbo Lippe here has led a-- shall I say-- sheltered existence. And I think we oughta help him, y'know, aroo-aroo!
M	RONALD	ASMI isn't a vacation for everybody, Dean. End of the day, Tim's here to work and to win. For his agency.
M	TIM	Exactly. And P-S, I would never, ever have "relations" or whatever with another woman.
M	JOAN (O.S.)	Hubba-hubba, check out these studs.
M	RONALD	Joan Ostrowski-Fox.
M	DEAN	The O-Fox!
F	JOAN	Here she is, Miss America.
M	RONALD	You fly in from Omaha, Joan?
F	JOAN	Yup. And boy are my arms tired. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 No, not really. I drove. Deanzie, let me say... ... you look maah-velous!
M	DEAN	Oh yeah baby. Shag-a-licious!
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Tim, this is the Queen Bee of ASMI, Joan Ostrowski-Fox. The O-Fox.
M	TIM	Hey. Ha. From the fitness center.
F	JOAN	Hey! It's Tim "don't get lippy with me" Lippe.
M	RONALD	You guys met?
F	JOAN	Oh yeah, and I was very naughty in there. I'm sorry about that, Tim.
M	DEAN	No she's not.
F	JOAN	No I'm not. Shots! What'll it be, gentlemen?
M	DEAN	Oh yeah, Jaeger time!
M	RONALD	Oh what the heck. Drambuie.
F	JOAN	Lippe?
M	TIM	Oh, I don't, ah... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Ah... Grenadine? Please.
F	JOAN	Careful you don't get too loaded, Lippe, or I might have to take advantage of you.
M	TIM	It's been a super long day. I, ah, better... Good night...
M	DEAN	Whoa-o here she comes-- she's a man eater!
M	TIM	Hello Bree.
F	BREE	Hey. Hey.
M	MILLIE	Marlene's brother's back in the hospital, so bridge got canceled. So we just watched hockey.
M	TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)	We? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	MILLIE	Me and Wade.
M	TIM	Wade.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	He says hey.
M	TIM	Oh. Tell him hey.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Tim says hey...
M	MILLIE (O. S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	I picked up that diet wet food for Brandy today.
M	TIM	I have to do some work before bed, so... Well I should let you go.
M	TIM	No, it's-- I love you so bad, babygirl. It's so hard here. I just miss you.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	I miss you, too, Tim. But this was your decision. You have to act like a big boy now.
M	TIM	Tss. Yeah, yeah. Keep reminding me.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	You'll be fine. Just be careful.
M	TIM	OK. You, too. I love you. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Current risk mitigation mechanisms available to hog farm operations include futures and options to...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	I'm in here!
M	DEAN	I know. This needs to be private. Whoa. Something didn't agree with you, did it? Second thought, meet me in the stairwell after you wrap things up in here.
M	TIM	What the heck is going on here?
M	DEAN	You sound like my fuckin' wife, Timbo. Jesus. Ex, I should say. EX.
M	TIM	Are you drunk?
M	DEAN	Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah. But we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar. I figured some shit out. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Like I told you, no shocker-- Helgesson's buttering you up to get you in his camp, because he knows you and me are close...
M	TIM	We're not close...
M	DEAN	Close enough. You're voting for me for President, right?
M	TIM	No I'm not.
M	DEAN	Well anyway, there's a petition going around trying to take away your company's Two Diamond Awards.
M	TIM	I know. I heard.
M	DEAN	Well hear this: After you left the bar, Mike Pyle comes up to me-- Pyle of shit, I call him-- and he asks do I want to sign this thing. And I go, "Lemke might have been a class-A deviant, but the guy was tits as a rep..."
M	TIM	Pardon my French, Dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar. My boss, Bill Krogstad? He told me how you called up Joyce Armbrüster and smeared Roger's name all over town...
M	DEAN	Joyce who...? Oh, no-no-no, whoa- whoa-whoa, that old whore called ME. Harping about Lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere. So I says, "OK, I'll run some numbers." Well, she calls back later that same day, says she got Krogstad to lower her premium. Which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place.
M	TIM	So wait, you didn't call her? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	DEAN	I may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em.
M	TIM	So what's with this petition?
M	DEAN	Personally? I think Mike Pyle of Shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency. Dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up Northlands at a bargain basement price. And you know what else I think? I think Orin's in on the deal somehow.
M	TIM	What? That's impossible.
M	DEAN	I can't quite figure it myself, but I know what I know. And what I know is you're wading into some duvious, er dubious, shit. Just be careful. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	ORIN	... In Your Name we pray Lord Jesus, Son of God, Author of our Salvation, our Redeemer, our Truth. Amen.
M	RONALD	Orin knows how to lead a prayer breakfast, tell you what.
M	TIM	Hmm...? Oh. Yeah.
M	RONALD	Little overwhelming? All this?
M	TIM	Hello, thank you. I feel like my head is gonna like... Y'know?
M	RONALD	Oh I hear ya L & C. Loud and clear. I was the same way when I first came to ASMI. The deciding which break-out sessions to attend, plus the politics, the pressure, the not knowing who to trust...
M	TIM	Excuse me, Ronald. It's my boss. This is Tim. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Tim. Bill Krogstad. Got a call from Orin Helgesson. Tells me he's worried about you. Tells me you're palling around with Dean Ziegler. Laughing at his jokes, buying him drinks...
M	TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)	I... No...
M	BILL KROGSTAD	What's the ONE thing I told you to do? The one thing, Tim? Steer clear of Dean Ziegler. GODDAMNIT, you're lousing the whole thing up!
M	DIONE KROGSTAD	Bill...
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Not now Dione.
M	TIM	Bill, I... That Dean Ziegler-- he was trying to warn me about Orin.
M	BILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE)	Warn you about Orin? Orin Helgesson has been ASMI Midwest Region President for 13 years! He is a LEGEND! And what do you do?! You go and pal around with his sworn enemy-- who, P.S., is a drunken loser!
M	TIM	Bill, I'm sorry... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 I sent you to ASMI to restore our image, Tim. One day into the deal you're lousing the whole thing up! See how far Gladstone is from Cedar Rapids, Dione. Look in the atlas.
M	DIONE KROGSTAD	You're not driving to Iowa, Bill. This is your daughter's wedding.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Oh cripes, you know as well as I do that Polack's gonna head for the hills the second he gets his papers. But no, you want to end up in the poor house, Dione, we'll go. Let's just keep on cashing checks we don't have...
M	DIONE KROGSTAD	We are going to our daughter's wedding, Bill.
M	TIM	I didn't know I did anything wrong.
M	BILL KROGSTAD (O.S. ON PHONE)	Well you better try doing something right, Lippe. Because if you keep lousing up, we all by god starve! And don't you tell me to calm down Dione!
F	JOAN	I'm a very bad girl. But I swear I only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Care for a Virginia Slim, Lippe? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	Whoa, what's wrong?
M	TIM	Mm, I don't know. Only everything.
M	TIM	He didn't have to yell at me. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm trying my hardest.
F	JOAN	D'you want me to kick his butt?
M	TIM	Could you?
F	JOAN	Absolutely. I know Krogstad. I could take him. `Sides, I'm a ninja. A nin- jette, actually. Hoo-waaaah! So Lippe, how'd you end up in the insurance game? God that sounded dorky-- insurance game. Look here, see, how'd you end up in the insurance game, see...?
M	TIM	You are freaky. No, it's kind of weird how I got interested in insurance, actually. When I was six, my dad got killed in a sawmill accident.
F	JOAN	Oh my God. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Yeah. Not good. But after he died, our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of. And we were. The crazy thing-- our agent was actually Bill Krogstad.
F	JOAN	No way. Really?
M	TIM	He had just opened Northlands. Anyway, I remember thinking, this guy's a hero. A real hero. So even if he doesn't always treat me, like y'know... whatever now-- I'll never forget that.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	This river-- the Cedar River? It flooded the whole city a couple years ago.
F	JOAN	I remember that. Massive disaster.
M	TIM	People talk about the firemen and policemen and that. But think about all the claims in a disaster like that-- how hard those agents worked to make sure people's lives weren't left in the lurch. We're talking billions of dollars in damages, literally. And claim by claim, dream by dream, those agents helped rebuild this city. I'm telling you, it's a noble calling. I really believe that.
F	JOAN	You realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman? You are a hero, Lippe.
M	TIM	Tss. I wish. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	No, I can tell. You're the Superman type. Kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin' stud underneath. They'd call you Insurance Man-- put a big red "I" on your chest...
M	TIM	Well, even if you're being full of it, thanks for saying that anyway.
F	JOAN	Well, you're welcome. So can you fly me back to the hotel, Insurance Man? I'm freezing my arse off.
M	DEAN	I'm saying a Bridge to the 22nd Century is a stupid theme, Helgesson. Not a goddamn one of us is even going to be alive in the 22nd Century...
M	ORIN	Oh, and I suppose under a Dean Ziegler administration, we'd just abandon E-Commerce and all that, huh? What's your take, Ronald?
M	RONALD	End of the day, you know I'm a big supporter of yours, Orin...
M	DEAN	Stab me in the fucking back why don't you, Wilkes...
M	RONALD	Why would I stab you in the back, Dean, when I'm telling you to your face that I think you'd be a lousy President? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 That deflates the tension. The three men are laughing as Tim
M	DEAN	Timbo! Sorry about that gigantic boner I got while we were spooning.
M	TIM	We didn't spoon, Orin...
M	ORIN	To each his own, Tim. I'm teasing, of course. Well, I gotta run to an Executive Council meeting. You fellas really ought to check out Mike Pyle's Prop/Cas seminar...
M	DEAN	Pyle of shit.
M	ORIN	Mike's a dynamite orator. I think you'd enjoy it. We'll see ya.
M	DEAN	Smug fuck. So who's ready for a drink?
M	RONALD	It's 11 in the morning.
M	DEAN	It's 11 in the morning. Can you believe this guy? C'mon Timbo, let's get the flock outta here. You need to leave me alone. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	MIKE PYLE	I'd like to share a humorous anecdote. A gentleman is drowning in a lake or pond, and he's 20 feet offshore. Well, along comes an actuary. And this actuary sees the drowning gentleman and throws him an 11 foot rope. And the gentleman says, "But I'm 20 feet offshore!" And the actuary says, "Well, I'm meeting you MORE than halfway."
M	MIKE PYLE (CONT'D)	So Property/Casualty Insurance, or Prop/Cas, it's one of the most dynamic areas of our industry...
M	MIKE PYLE (CONT'D)	Ah, is there a Tim Lip in here? There's an emergency call.
M	TIM	Hello.
M	VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Herro Mr. Tim, my name Chin Chang. There bad news about your fiancé.
M	TIM	Millie? Something happened...?
M	VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Ah, you wise man Mr. Tim. She die in horrible car accident... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	... but her dying wish for you, Mr. Tim, to get shit-face with Deanzie.
M	DEAN	Timbo! Turn around!
M	TRENT	Gentlemen! I will call security.
M	TIM	What the H did I ever do to you, you a-hole.
M	DEAN	Come on bud, I was having fun.
M	TIM	I just wanted to hear your voice.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Brandy, no! Bad girl! Sorry, she's giving me grief over this new wet food. What did you need now, Tim?
M	TIM	Nothing. Nothing really...
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Well I for one feel like I ought to be on the fire department, I'm putting out so many fires. Lucy Kofnetka asked me to do altar guild for her. Again. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Oh.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Patti told me Lucy's seeing some guy who doesn't even go to church, so she apparently feels no need to maintain her responsibil... Brandy! No! She's going number two on the floor! No! You get outside! I'll call you later, Tim...
M	TIM	I'd like to sign up for the scavenger hunt.
M	WOMAN	Super. Teaming with a co-worker or are you in need of a partner? This is a team event, like the Amazing Race. On TV? But instead of going around the world, you look for stuff in Cedar Rapids. And instead of a million dollars, the winning team gets a $75 gift card for Westdale, which is...
M	TIM	Eastern Iowa's largest two-story mall. I know. Sweet. And yes, I do have a teammate. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Everything OK?
F	JOAN	Yeah, what was that call?
M	TIM	Oh, nothing. Say Joan, you have something on your blouse.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Burn.
F	JOAN	You are very weird...
M	TIM	Thank you. Thank you very much. So, ah, I signed you up for the Scavenger Hunt. To be my teammate. In the Scavenger Hunt.
F	JOAN	Really? Why?
M	TIM	Uh, well I... Because Ronald already had a teammate...
M	RONALD	Bill Hernandez?
F	JOAN	Taco Bill.
M	TIM	... And I thought you'd-- we'd-- be y'know, a decent team. So... I think you should do it.
F	JOAN	Heck yeah! I get to be Insurance Man's sidekick. We're going to kick some ASS! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	ORIN	Like last year there'll be a few physical challenges...
M	TIM	I am super pumped!
F	JOAN	Whoo-hoo.
M	ORIN	Course this should be considered a fun event, in the spirit of team building. You can find your first clue "under the sea." By which I mean in the pool area. So ready, set, race!
M	TIM	You're going down, a-hole.
M	DEAN	Let's roll, Perry-- Perry-plegic. Get it, like paraplegic? But...
M	PERRY	Yeah. Good one, Dean-tard. Like retard, but Dean-tard. Get it? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 TIM Check it out-- Planet X!
M	TIM (CONT'D)	I compiled a ton of info on Cedar Rapids. I've got a sweet laminator in my basement.
F	JOAN	Ooh, that's hot...
M	TIM	... Maps, area attractions, crime stats, local customs...
F	JOAN	Look at you...
M	TIM	Bingo! Right here-- Planet X Family Fun Center. Let's go. Act natural.
F	JOAN	What a gyp. There are no stinkin' clues in here.
M	TIM	OK, I think we're going to want to take Blair's Ferry Road to Avenue C, then probably east on 100.
F	JOAN	Why would you possibly know that?
M	TIM	I memorized the major thoroughfares and landmarks in the metro area.
M	MUSIC BED OVER:	Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	"You've seen the future, now Czech out Cedar Rapid's past." But it's Czech, like Czechoslovakia. C'mon!
M	DEAN	Know what that cow's thinking, Pyle? She's thinking, "quit pulling on my tits and fuck me already."
F	JOAN	Ugh. I'm gonna puke.
M	TIM	No, you're doing great, Joan. And you look super awesome with a wiener in your mouth. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	Oh my God, did you just make a dick joke, Lippe?
M	TIM	No. Maybe.
M	ORIN	OK guys, this is it. First team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match. ASMI's past is behind us; But our future looks nice; Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century... by scaling this silo of ice!
F	JOAN	That doesn't even... There's no such thing as silo ice climbing.
M	TIM	No, it's actually a big thing in Iowa. ABC news did a story about it. I saw it on YouTube.
F	JOAN	Of course you did. Well, you can do it then...
M	TIM	Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared crapless of heights.
F	JOAN	You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz I'm not climbing jack. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that...
M	TIM	Yeah. Let's do this thing. Hang on... How's it...?
M	MIKE PYLE	Little help here...
M	TIM	Ugh. This is frickin' hard.
M	RONALD	Really hard.
M	DEAN	I think I just shit my pants. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	ORIN	OK gang, that was Rick Martini with the National Chapter. Here's the deal. Since no one could do the final task, and since Joan and Tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize. Unless anyone's got a problem with that?
M	RONALD	Dangit. You could've done better, Wilkes.
M	TIM	Wait, we won?
M	ORIN	Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75 gift card for the Westdale Mall.
M	TIM	Oh crap. I forgot... Hey, Millie.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	I have been trying to reach you for the last eight hours, Timothy. I was going to call the police. Where have you been?
M	TIM	I'm sorry, Mil. I signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won! My teammate and I, that is. Joan.
F	JOAN	Hi Millie! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	That was Joan saying hi. Millie says hi.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE)	I did not say hi. I didn't say anything. If you had asked, I would have told you that I've been at the vet half the day because Brandy swallowed a pencil eraser.
M	MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D)	Lucky for us it came out naturally or we'd have been looking at surgery.
F	JOAN	I'll just meet you inside.
M	TIM	OK. Sounds good. Sorry Mil, go ahead.
M	MILLIE	So who's this Joan?
M	TIM	Just some gal from Omaha they paired me up with. Between you and me, she's a little different. Real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar gift card, I'm not going to complain. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 You promised you'd check in with me. I'm very disappointed.
M	TIM	OK, Mom...
M	MILLIE	Well. You obviously have more important things to do than talk to me. My brother and I were just getting ready to go for fish at the Eagles anyhow.
M	MILLIE (CONT'D)	Go warm up the car, Wade.
M	TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)	Mil, I didn't...
M	MILLIE	It's fine. You'll call me some time when it's convenient for you, Tim. Good Night.
M	TIM	Hey. What say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here? At the mall. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	We have a gift card. But I didn't make a reservation. Is that OK?
M	MAÎTRE D'	Right this way, sir.
M	WAITER	Coors Lite for the madam. A cream sherry for monsieur. And here are some bottomless bread sticks.
M	TIM	Nice. Thanks.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	To victory. To new friends. To life. And all the joys of living it.
F	JOAN	That's really nice. Cheers.
M	TIM	Mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine. Awesome. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	So Lippe, I'm trying to figure you out. Hopes, dreams, aspirations, blah-blah-blah? Whaddaya got?
M	TIM	Mine? Let's see. Um. I would love-- some day-- to put a little greenhouse in my backyard.
F	JOAN	Dream the impossible dream...
M	TIM	No, I've actually seen some fairly decent portable ones at Fleet Farm that won't break the bank...
F	JOAN	C'mon, man. I mean fantasy-land stuff. What do you really want?
M	TIM	Well. I always hoped I could take over Northlands when Bill retired. But that obviously isn't going to happen now.
F	JOAN	Oh, screw him. He wants to sell, why don't you just buy Northlands?
M	TIM	Yeah right.
F	JOAN	Why not? You could get a loan.
M	TIM	I don't... Probably not.
F	JOAN	You know the business. You know the clients. You actually care about your job. You'd be perfect. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Grrrr. Ha. Time out. Sheesh. Let's. OK. What I'd really like is a family. To be a dad. So kids, I guess, that's what I really want.
F	JOAN	Yeah well, you can have mine.
M	TIM	You've got kids?
F	JOAN	Tyler's ten. Ashley'll be eight next month. My little squirrels.
M	TIM	Awesome. Beautiful kids. And that's...?
F	JOAN	My hubby. Rich Fox. Richie. We met when we were both Rotary exchange students in high school. Lived in Norway for a semester.
M	TIM	Norway.
F	JOAN	I was such a spaz. Band geek, total ugly duckling-- braces, acne, the whole nine. I didn't even get boobs until college. Anyway, we ended up getting married sophomore year. Then kids. Then blah-blah-blah, and here we are. Richie's a Supervisor in the Parks Department now. For the County.
M	TIM	Wow.
F	JOAN	I know it's effed up. And if I had it all to do over again, I don't know what I'd choose. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 But I don't have that option. So this is my fantasy-land, Tim. Cedar Rapids. ASMI. This. I come here, and for a few days I'm someone else. No kids. No husband. No responsibility. Wild woman. Sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is-- know what I mean, Lippe?
M	TIM	OK. I thought of another one.
F	JOAN	One what?
M	TIM	Wish. Or dream or whatever. It's still small potatoes compared to...
F	JOAN	No, let's hear it...
M	TIM	... to all you've done-- Norway and all that, but... Do you watch American Idol ever?
F	JOAN	You wanna be on American Idol?
M	TIM	No-no-no. Negative! Sheesh. But I do enjoy watching it quite a bit. Randy's always like, "That's awesome, dawg!" And Simon's such a-- "Oh, I'm so superior." Anyhow I was thinking of maybe trying-- trying-- to get a solo in my choir. At church. I mean, it's all super political. But I'm a fair to middlin' baritone, so... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	That's great, Tim. You'll do it. I know you will. Very cool.
F	JOAN	Wanna get one for the road, stud?
M	TIM	Oh no, I have to practice my Two Diamond presentation. I can't...
F	JOAN	One nightcap. It'll loosen you up.
M	TIM	Ha. Nightcap. Kneecap, more like...
F	JOAN	What?
M	TIM	Yes.
M	DEAN	Timbo and the O-Fox! Wondered when you crazy kids were gonna show up.
M	RONALD	Can I buy the big-shot winners a drink? Coors Lite for Joan. And Tim, you want a pop? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Actually, do they have cream sherry?
M	RONALD	Cream sherry. Jeez, guess that victory really did go to your head.
F	JOAN	Coors Lite's good for me, thanks. I gotta run wash my hands quick.
M	DEAN	You tag that yet, Timbo? Bet she's moist as a damp sponge, huh?
M	TIM	She is MARRIED. And you're just... What is wrong with you?
M	DEAN	Shit, what isn't wrong me? I drink too much, I weigh too much, I piss people off. Speaking of, that crank call earlier-- way outta line. People are right, I am an asshole.
M	TIM	Well. Yeah. You kind of are. But I guess I've seen worse.
M	DEAN	I love it! "I guess I've seen worse." I love it! Yeah shit, s'pose we all wish our lives had gone a little different. You don't come into this deal going, "Dear God, please let my wife toss me out on my ass. Please give my children the courage to hate my fucking guts. Thank you Jesus. Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!" Ach, I'm just having fun. No offense Big Man! Right, Timbo? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Ronald! Hello. Thanks mucho... So Ronald, what's your situation? You married, or...?
M	RONALD	Negative. I'm pretty well married to Ronald Wilkes Insurance. I also do quite a bit of work with the St. Cloud Chamber. I'm Senior Warden at my church. So really, no time for a Mrs. Ronald Wilkes.
M	TIM	Wow.
M	RONALD	Don't get me wrong, I have my guilty pleasures-- antiquing, I'm active in community theater. And I have to admit I'm a big enthusiast of the HBO program, The Wire. But shux, I haven't had a proper vacation in nine years.
M	TIM	I never use my vacation time.
M	DEAN	Maybe you two should take one of those gay cruises together.
M	RONALD	You know what you are Ziegler? You're what I call a real Richard.
M	RONALD (CONT'D)	Mr. Richard Head.
M	TIM	Dick head. Yeah Dean, you are a total Richard!
M	DEAN	Ha! I love it! Richard head! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 To Tim-- the young rookie comes in, takes the scavenger hunt. That right there is P-T. Prime Time.
M	DEAN	Would you rather toss a bum's salad, y'know, eat out his butthole or... give your dad a B-J?
M	RONALD	Come on Ziegler, this is supposed to be a clean game...
M	TIM	No, if you used some salad dressing a bum's a-hole might not taste that bad. Thousand Island!
F	JOAN	Shots! Kamikazes, good sir.
M	KARAOKE DJ (O.S.)	OK. We're ready for Tim Lip to rock the mic. Is there a Tim Lip?
M	TIM	Did he just...?
F	JOAN	Why wait for the church choir when you can take care of one of your dreams right now, dude?
M	TIM	No, no, no, no, no...
F	JOAN	I know you can do it, Lippe. Go be my hero-- Insurance Man. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	KARAOKE DJ	Tim Lip? You in the house?
M	TIM	I, um, I've met some really, just super neat people here. But this song, I'd like to dedicate to the first African-American person I've ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at the Oneida Mall in Rhinelander-- said hello and that. But... Anyway, I just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes!
M	TIM (CONT'D)	I was born and raised down in Alabama. On a farm way back up in the woods. I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches. Papa used to tease me about it. But deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	My papa was a great old man. I can see him with a shovel in his hands. See education he never had; He did wonders when the times got bad. The little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made.
M	MUSIC BED OVER:	Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	RONALD	The presentation's in 36 hours. I can't afford to be off my game. Frankly, neither can you, Tim.
M	RONALD (CONT'D)	This is ridiculous, you guys. Told you, it closed an hour ago.
M	RONALD (CONT'D)	Tim. Come on. This isn't you.
M	TIM	Uh-oh. Who is it then?
M	RONALD	You know what I mean. We've both worked our tails off. Why poop it away on...
M	DEAN	Check this out-- Captain Nemo!
M	TIM	I know. I just... No frickin' way!
F	JOAN	Whaddaya say, Lippe? Take a dippy?
M	TIM	Ich can nicht schwimmen. That's "I can't swim." In German. And I can't. `Sides, I didn't bring a bathing suit.
F	JOAN	So we stay in the shallow end. And neither did I.
M	TIM	Yow. Chilly. Ha.
F	JOAN	So.
M	TIM	Yep. Ha. Fun. Fun day.
F	JOAN	So.
M	TIM	Oh jeez. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM (CONT'D)	You have tan. A tan. Tan line. You have a.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	You. Are. You're. Married. I have a fian...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Oh jeez...
M	DEAN	Hell yeah.
M	ORIN	What the heck's going on down there?!
M	DEAN	Suck my ass, Helgesson.
M	ORIN	I'm calling security! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Holy crap! We're so dead!
M	TIM (CONT'D)	I want to make love!
M	DEAN	Come on, Ronimal! My key got wet. Wake up, man! Ah, fuck it.
M	TIM	Your body's just so... firm and pretty. Mmm. Making love to you was just super... super awesome.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Wanna cuddle?
F	JOAN	Cuddle? Um. OK. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	I love to cuddle. You're special, Joan. So special...
F	JOAN	No baby, you guys are playing at Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next week... Calm down, Tyler. You're not gonna miss it. It's not that far. Put your dad on.
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	Hey. Did you not look at the schedule on the fridge? Did we not have this conversation 10 minutes before I left? No, no, no. The playoffs are in Ralston. This is the last regular season game. He actually has a chance to play, Richie. Christ.
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	Fine, but watch your speed on 84th by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's gotten busted twice right there. By that golf course. Yeah, Tara Hills. Exactly. OK. Love you, too. Bye. Oh, tell Ty to kick some butt for me. `K. See ya.
M	TIM	Good morning. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	Crisis on the home front. Sorry if I woke you up.
M	TIM	No problemo. Is that...? Were you looking at my Two Diamond presentation?
F	JOAN	Your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so I shut it off. When I saw the discs, I figured I'd take a look. It's a solid presentation.
M	TIM	Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's...
F	JOAN	Yeah, I see that. You know we were together right?
M	TIM	What? Whaddaya...? You and... You and Roger, you mean?
F	JOAN	It's so stupid-- but everyone basically treated us like the Brangelina of ASMI for a while there. It ended two years ago. He was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now.
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter. You knew, didn't you?
M	TIM	My foot I knew! No, I did not. And yes, it most certainly does matter. Man, this T's me off. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	Tell me you're not jealous. You can't be jealous. The guy's dead.
M	TIM	Every stinkin' place I go people remind me: You're no Roger Lemke. You're not as good as Roger Lemke. Here we go again.
F	JOAN	As good? Tim, Roger was a small- minded, egotistical jerk. You're an infinitely better man than he was.
M	TIM	Why were you with him then?
F	JOAN	Why? I don't know. I don't know. I guess I probably maybe don't like myself very much. I don't know.
M	TIM	Hey, hey. Come on. You're pretty and smart and just super awesome. I like you.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Grrr. I'm so frickin' confused. Last thing I thought was that I'd come to Cedar Rapids and fall in love.
F	JOAN	What are you talking about?
M	TIM	Us. This.
F	JOAN	What this? What are you talking about? There's no this. There's no us. I have a family. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 What about...?
F	JOAN	What about it? I told you, what I do here... In Cedar Rapids... It stays here.
M	TIM	Where the heck are my clothes?
F	JOAN	Come on, Tim. We're adults here. You're acting like a child...
M	TIM	Yeah. Well, you're acting like a fricking... prostitute.
M	TIM	I lost my slacks somewhere. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	I'm really, really sorry Ronald. If I said anything, or...
M	RONALD	Hey, it's not Ronald Wilkes's job to judge you, Tim. End of the day, the Lord's got that covered. But am I disappointed? You bet I am. Heck, I'm all for having fun. But I didn't think you were one of these guys who comes down here only to get loaded and act like a derelict.
M	TIM	No, I'm not. I... Timbo! Ronimal!
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	You should have stuck around last night, Ronimal. Watching Timbo and the O-Fox get it on in the pool-- shit, I was harder than Chinese arithmetic.
M	RONALD	What a couple of class acts. I'm running late for the prayer breakfast. Oh and Tim, Bill Krogstad's been trying to reach you all morning. FYI.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Tim, Bill Krogstad again. Orin Helgesson told me about your little hootenanny in the pool there. Clear violation of ASMI's Morals Code-- meaning we lose our ASMI certification, we lose our Two Diamond rating, we lose our customers and I lose any chance of ANYONE buying my goddamn business. I may as well just commit suicide...
M	PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)	Father of the bride. We're set.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Yah. Be there in a... Call me when you get this Tim. Because unless you pull off a miracle, we're done. You've let me down hard. Cripes... shaping up to be the worst day of my life.
M	BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)	You look real beautiful, Kayla. Like a flower.
M	TIM	Goddarnit!
M	DEAN	That time of the month? C'mon man, it's gonna be OK.
M	TIM	No it's not. Nothing is OK. My job, my fiancé... God, I'm a philanderer. I've let Bill down. I've let everybody down.
M	DEAN	C'mere, kiddo. Sit. Sit down. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	My ex, Patti? Well-established fact that this broad is a serious fucking cuntstain, right? But like I say, she's made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts-- I'm the bad guy. `Cept when our 17-year-old daughter comes home PREGNANT-- oh yeah, happy day in the Ziegler household, lemme tell ya-- who's the one so depressed that she can't get out from under the afghan on the goddamn couch? Patti. And who's the one planning the baby showers and taking Meg to the gyno, all that shit? The fucking Deanzie. That's who.
M	TIM	Is this...? Why is this all of a sudden about you, Dean?
M	DEAN	I'm telling you this, buddy, because it shows to go ya-- even if you're a fucking waste of space jerk-off like myself, there's always opportunities to do the right thing. If this Two Diamond bullshit and that matters so much, you'll find a way to make it right. If not, fuck it. Life's way too short to lose sleep over shit that don't matter.
M	ORIN	Without any more ado, our keynote speaker, Iowa Insurance Commissioner, Mrs. Susan Voss! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	President Helgesson, please let me stay in the Two Diamond contest. Please. This isn't for me-- it's for Bill Krogstad. I can't let him down. Please just let me compete.
M	ORIN	Tiffany Suite. Bit much. Perks of the Presidency, guess you'd say. Please. Have a seat on the davenport.
M	ORIN (CONT'D)	Drink?
M	TIM	Ah, no. Thanks.
M	ORIN	Suit yourself.
M	TIM	This is the petition?
M	ORIN	Between you and me-- this was a ploy by Mike Pyle. Trying to drive down the value of Northlands so he could get it on the cheap. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	ORIN (CONT'D)	I just made that happen. Poof. Gone. Rainmaker. Northlands keeps its three previous Two Diamond Awards.
M	TIM	Oh my gosh, really? Thank you.
M	ORIN	One thing Roger Lemke knew, Tim? He knew that when you get all dolled up, go to the prom-- the Big Dance-- that you gotta be prepared to put out. To show a little teat. You ever hear of PayPal, Tim?
M	TIM	PayPal? Um, yeah. I've used it to pay for Beanie Babies on E-Bay... For my fiancé.
M	ORIN	Good. Thing you gotta ask yourself now is this: "Am I ready to dance? Am I ready to show a little TEAT?"
M	TIM	I don't understand what you mean...
M	ORIN	Calm down, Orin. I'm sorry. Please, let's talk E-Commerce for a minute.
M	ORIN (CONT'D)	Four years ago, the brain trust at ASMI National mandated we go "on- line" for everything. Billing, newsletter, the whole shebang. Now I'm almost 70-years-old-- I's about as likely to figure this deal out as I was to learn Chinese. Well, as you know Roger Lemke was a real whiz on the computer... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	You bet.
M	ORIN	So Roger's up here looking over this new system, and he gets one of these lightbulb-going-off kinda looks, the way he did. And he says, "Orin, with that newsletter going digital you're saving almost four grand a year in printing costs alone. Four grand. Pure profit." You see where this is going, Tim?
M	TIM	I can't say that I do...
M	ORIN	PayPal. That's where. What has ASMI ever given Orin Helgesson? Huh? Not dime one. Sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the National Board. Have I not been a good President? Do I not deserve a little something?
M	TIM	You're an awesome President...
M	ORIN	You're GODDAMN right I am!
M	ORIN (CONT'D)	But I don't know the first blessed thing about this PayPal deal. Roger had the on-line know-how, not me.
M	TIM	I'm still not reading you here...
M	ORIN	There aren't printing costs anymore, see? The ASMI-teer's digital. E- Commerce! Don't you get it, Tim? All that money-- almost 39-hundred dollars a year-- that goes into a PayPal account now. My PayPal account. But I've got no idea how to use it. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Do you literally mean you just need help, like, getting on-line, or...?
M	ORIN	Your performance in that scavenger hunt was first-rate. Then I see you in the pool making love to that floozy, I realize maybe you've got a bit of Lemke's, shall we say, moral ambiguity. I need that.
M	TIM	You're talking about stealing.
M	ORIN	Pontoon boats don't pay for themselves, Tim. Roger Lemke came to the prom. He showed me a little teat. I rewarded him with the Two Diamonds three years running. I'm prepared to do the same for you. What do you say? You take home those those Two Diamonds, Northlands' value skyrockets, Bill Krogstad retires to his time share. Everybody wins...
M	TIM	I'd be doing it for Northlands-- to keep it in Brown Valley and help my co-workers. To help Bill... What would you need me to do exactly...?
M	ORIN	OK, marvelous! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	DEAN	Vote for Deanzie. Vote for change.
M	WOMAN	I'm good thanks.
M	DEAN	Well fuck you very much, Carla.
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	I can count on your vote tomorrow, right Ronimal?
M	RONALD	Not a snowball's chance in Hades.
M	DEAN	You're all a bunch of dicks.
M	RONALD	Hey there, Hangover Harry. 18 hours and counting. Got your guns loaded for the Two Diamonds, partner?
M	TIM	Um. I... I don't know about that.
M	RONALD	Don't be nervous. You'll do fine. There's a prayer circle tonight before the entertainment program-- might help ease your mind.
M	TIM	I'm sorry about... Ronald. Just... about everything... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	KAY	Happy Saturday! What'cha drinkin'?
M	TIM	A large cream sherry, please.
M	KAY	Looks like you could use some cheering up. What do you call it when it rains chickens and ducks? Fowl weather.
M	TIM	That's pretty hilarious.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Another please. I have to use the little boy's room.
M	TIM	Bree? It's Tim Lippe. From the ASMI convention. We met out in front of the Holidome across the street? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 That's what you get from smoking all those-- what'd you call `em, heaters? Smoker's cough. Ha. Just kidding. Butterscotch?
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Small world, huh?
F	BREE	Totally. You wanna party?
M	TIM	Ooh, that's really awesome of you to ask. But I have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately, so...
M	GARY	I gotta work in the morning, too. Can't be productive or whatever without occasionally taking a little ride on the good times express. It's like, fuck that shit, yo.
M	TIM	Yeah. I hear that. L & C. Loud and... clear.
F	BREE	Seriously. We're going to this thing at my Uncle Ken's later-- after his shift's done.
M	BREE (CONT'D)	You look like you're in serious need of some relaxation, dude.
M	TIM	I have had a pretty messed up day actually. Might not hurt to forget about it for a little while.
M	ORIN	My advice, Mike? Pull the trigger. I've pretty well convinced him that his company's in the crapper. 85- thousand is as low as I could possibly get him.
M	MIKE PYLE	He's said nothing to indicate I'd have to hang onto his employees or the office up there, right?
M	ORIN	Bill was real clear about that. You're buying his clients-- not his brand. You've done this before, Mike. The Northlands policies will simply roll over into your Allstate office in Milwaukee. Unless you want to keep a satellite branch up there in North Palookaville.
M	MIKE PYLE	OK. Let's pull the trigger.
M	ORIN	Oh, and Mike-- we're square on my consultant's fee?
M	MIKE PYLE	Ten percent, as agreed.
M	ORIN	Marvelous. Now just give me a second here...
M	ORIN	We're all systems go over here, Bill. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Praise Christ! This is super, Orin!
M	ORIN	I was able to get Pyle up to 81- thousand for you, Bill, which is pretty amazing given all the... the tribulations and that. Of course that number doesn't include my 15 percent consultant's fee.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Y'know what Orin, it's only a seven hour drive to Cedar Rapids. If I leave right now, I can be there first thing in the A-M and we can lock this sonofagun down.
M	ORIN (O.S. ON PHONE)	I wouldn't want to put you out, Bill, but it would be nice to put pen to paper on a contract sooner than later.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Hell yes. You bet. It's no problem. I'll be there in time to see the Two Diamond presentations-- not that that matters to me anymore! Thanks a million, Orin!
M	BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D)	Dione, the deal's going through! 81- grand! We're getting this albatross off our backs after all. I'm going to Cedar Rapids.
M	DIONE KROGSTAD	No, Bill...
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Goddamnit, Dione, not now. This is happening. No flex on this one! Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	JACK NICHOLSON IMPERSONATOR	... You can't handle the truth!
F	JOAN	We used to get bands, Ronald. Real bands. Kansas. REO Speedwagon... Remember REO let me get on stage and play tambourine?
M	RONALD	I'll go ahead and admit, this is an odd choice for an ASMI headliner. Budget crunch, I guess.
M	JACK NICHOLSON IMPERSONATOR	Danny isn't here Mrs. Torrance!
M	DEAN	Are you ready for this? Mike Pyle of Shit just bought Northlands. Word is the cocksucker's liquidating Timbo and the whole Brown Valley operation.
M	RONALD	What? Holy smokes. Does Tim know?
F	JOAN	Don't look at me. I don't think Tim likes me very much anymore.
M	DEAN	Cry me a fucking river, honey. This isn't about you for once.
F	JOAN	Fuck off, Dean. Jackass.
M	RONALD	Hey. Come on you guys. Cut it out. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	JACK NICHOLSON IMPERSONATOR	I said, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just going to bash your brains in.
M	DEAN	You two are a couple of serious fucking downers, man. Timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago-- you saw him Ronimal. Maybe he already knew. Shit, the kid's one of my best friends...
M	RONALD	You met him two days ago, Ziegler.
M	DEAN	Know what, blow me Ronald. It's not my fault you're too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him. Do what you want, but the Deanzie's gonna make sure his friend is doing OK.
M	TIM	That must be pretty all right, Ken, getting half off at Applebee's all the time. I'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds...
M	UNCLE KEN	Pass me that cube, Skeet.
M	TIM	Ah...? This would be marijuana, I'm guessing? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	BREE	Suck the glass dick, dude.
M	TIM	Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.
F	BREE	A butterscotch might help.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)	Hello.
M	DEAN	Trying to reach Tim Lippe. Who am I talking to?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S. ON PHONE)	This is Kay over at the Applebee's. Your friend left his phone here.
M	DEAN	That right? Is he there now?
M	KAY (O.S. ON PHONE)	No he's not. Be honest, I was kinda worried about the little guy...
M	TIM	I FEEL AMAZING! THIS IS AWESOME!
F	BREE	HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE ON YOU? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	AH, CASH-WISE? ABOUT 90 DOLLARS, I THINK. I'VE GOT A TON OF TRAVELER'S CHECKS, THOUGH. WHY?
F	BREE	I'LL GET US SOME MORE CRYPTO. THEN YOU CAN FUCK ME IF YOU WANT.
M	TIM	DO WHAT NOW?
F	BREE	JUST GIMME A HUNDRED.
M	KAY	Like I say, he was pretty ripped from all that sherry. He left with Ken and them for some party.
M	DEAN	Who's Ken?
M	KAY	Ken's our cook. We all think he deals dope, though. I get along good with everyone. But Ken? He's just real different.
M	RONALD	Oh jeez. D'you know where they were going? Any idea?
M	KAY	You could try Ken's place. It's way out in the boonies... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	My mom became real protective of me after my dad passed. She didn't really let me play sports or any of that. Fact, if I think about it, I never really did much of anything. Except gardening, which I do enjoy.
F	BREE	Well you're livin' now. Here.
M	BREE (CONT'D)	I bought some pills, too. Here. These'll make you feel better.
M	TIM	Thanks. It's funny, though, because my job is all about protecting other people's dreams. But what about my dreams?
F	BREE	It could be like-- maybe... Whoa, shit's tight... Like maybe it has to do with your parents both dying? Like, maybe by protecting other people-- it's like you're trying to save your parents. Like somehow you feel like it's your fault? Like in your sub-conscience?
M	BREE (CONT'D)	And so you're not really like, living your own life fully? But dude, let me tell you this: the only real insurance in this life-- is love.
M	BREE (CONT'D)	Oh baby, c'mere. C'mere. You can fuck my ass if you want. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	Oh man. This place is bad news.
M	WASTED TEEN GIRL	Faggot. Watch out.
M	DEAN	I'll be standing by `case things get squirrelly in there. Getaway vehicle type scenario. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	So you're sending me into that shithole? How chivalrous, Dean.
M	RONALD	You and me can go in, Joan. It'll be fine, I'm sure...
M	GARY	Nice tits.
F	JOAN	Thanks. Thank you. That's nice.
M	RONALD	We don't want any trouble, guys. We're just looking for our friend.
M	DEAN	Mm-mow-mow... Two tickets to paradise. Hmm-hmm, pack your bags we'll leave tonight... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	Oh shit.
F	BREE	But he paid for it, Uncle Ken...
M	UNCLE KEN	You can't let some dude pay for crystal meth and an ass fuck with a traveler's check, Bree. That shit can be traced.
M	TIM	It's fully insured. 100 percent. And we didn't make love...
M	UNCLE KEN	Shut the fuck up.
M	RONALD (O.S.)	Hey! HEY!
M	RONALD (CONT'D)	I may look like some suit wearin' businessman to y'all. Truth is, I'm straight up gangsta. And I always keeps one in the chamber... ... in case you ponderin'. So I suggest for the time being that you let my nigga be. Muthafucka.
M	RONALD (CONT'D)	Indeed. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	DEAN	Oh fuck!
M	RONALD	Run!
M	DEAN	What the fuck happened?
F	JOAN	Oh my God, Tim. Are you OK?
M	TIM	I don't know. I don't know. All I know is I was getting kicked and then Ronald was there talking like a ghetto person... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 In order to extricate Tim from what was clearly a volatile situation, I did, in fact, rely on my community theater training. I don't like to brag, but I do a pretty convincing Omar from the HBO program, The Wire. Least them crackers back yonder seemed to buy it.
M	DEAN	The Ronimal!
M	TIM	I can't believe Bill would do this to me. He was like a father...
M	DEAN	Wasn't just Krogstad, Timbo. Orin's the real devil in this deal.
F	JOAN	You'll find another job, Lippe. Maybe even move to a new town.
M	RONALD	Shoot, you could come work for me if you wanted.
M	TIM	I love you, Joan.
F	JOAN	Get some sleep you guys. I'll stay up with him-- make sure he doesn't chew his arm off. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	DEAN	Sleep good, little friend.
M	TIM	I didn't make love to Bree, Joan.
F	JOAN	It doesn't matter. Here, lie down, Lippe.
M	JOAN (CONT'D)	Oh dear, what can the matter be Johnny's so long at the fair. He promised to bring me a pocket of posies...
M	ORIN	Oh, Tim. Just a sec. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
F	JOAN	Oh shit...
M	TIM	Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light. I never seen such a beautiful sight! See love glowin' on us every night, I know forever we'll be doin' it right!
M	TIM	I always wanna call you "friend!" Sweet love showin' us a heavenly...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Careful. It's super slippery.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Whoop. Careful now. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	ORIN	Nmmmmmmmmm!
M	TIM	I did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation. Don't worry-- they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source. But there's never been a recorded hog- bite death. So...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	The Two Diamonds may be meaningless to you and Bill. But there are people who care about this stuff. Ronald Wilkes. Even Dean. Honest, good people. I'll come back for you after the Two Diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner. I'm really sorry about this, Orin, but the insurance industry deserves better than you.
M	WIFE	Who the heck's calling at this hour on a Sunday morning?
M	HUSBAND	Hello.
M	TIM (O.S. ON PHONE)	Kurt Gambsky, Tim Lippe-- your insurance agent. How's Pam and the girls? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	HUSBAND	Tim Lippe. Um, fine, Tim. We're fine. Everything OK by you?
M	TIM	Well, I think everything's OK. Hope it is anyway. Listen Kurt, here's why I'm calling...
M	RONALD	People sometimes say that promises are cheap. You know what Ronald Wilkes says to that? N-S-F. Not so fast. At the end of the day, a man's word is a sacred creed. And the word I give you at Ronald Wilkes Insurance is-- I will work for you. Thank you.
M	EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER	Once again folks, President Helgesson left a note under my door this morning saying he had to leave ASMI early due to a family emergency. I haven't been able to reach him on his mobile, but obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to Orin and his family. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Now... we're set to hear our final Two Diamond presenter. Tim Lip from Northlands Insurance. Tim?
M	DEAN	Hey Travis, I don't think Tim...
M	TIM	Thank you. I'm Tim Lippe. Hog farm risk mitigation... What is...?
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Smooth move, Ex-Lax. So, Hog... No. I, ah... this girl I met, sorry woman, I guess. She's 23. She takes drugs, and I think might be some kind of prostitute. But she's super insightful. Y'know what she said to me last night? Said the only real insurance is love. That's fricking INTENSE, isn't it...?
M	TIM (CONT'D)	I'm... ah... Our only true safety net. Love. Crazy. I believe in insurance. I believe in love...
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Bill! Bill Krogstad. My former boss, everybody. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 What're you doing, Lippe?
M	TIM	Why'd you do this, Bill? I don't understand.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	Why'd you do it, Bill? Why'd you do it? Why'd you lie, Bill?
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Sorry, folks. Guess it's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business. Must've missed that constitutional amendment.
M	TIM	Insurance isn't just a business, Bill. Insurance is personal. I've got some savings. I could've gotten a loan. We could've worked something out.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Yeah, there's a guy you want running an agency, isn't it? Come on, Tim, you're tired. You're looking foolish here. You couldn't run an agency if your life depended on it.
M	TIM	Screw you, Bill. Screw you... hard. That's a bunch of dog crap. You and Lemke, that... fucking pervert... you stole my ideas and called them your own for years. And I didn't say squat-- because I figured we were like a family. I may not have quite as many clients as Roger had. But my people are loyal, Bill. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 I care about them. And guess what, they care about me. Fact, I've called more than half of them already this morning...
M	BILL KROGSTAD	Watch yourself, Lippe...
M	TIM	I knew which ones would be on their way to church, which ones I'd be waking up, which ones probably got a little blotto last night and might be hung over... And every single person I talked to-- every one-- is staying with me.
M	BILL KROGSTAD	You don't know what you're doing.
M	TIM	I do actually. I do know, Bill. And before the day is out, I'll have called all my clients. All of them. So hey, congratulations Pyle of Shit-- you just bought a company that's losing half its business.
M	DEAN	Fuck yeah Timbo!
M	ORIN (O.S.)	Right there, officer. That's him.
M	JOAN RONALD	Jesus Lippe, what did you do? Aw jeez. This is no good.
M	DEAN	What's the fucking charge?
M	TIM	Here. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 What's this?
M	TIM	You'll figure it out.
M	TIM	I know what you're thinking-- thinking "this wiseacre's full of baloney." Am I right?
M	TIM (CONT'D)	But I'm telling you Reginald, you're actually a perfect candidate for term life...
M	GUARD	Tim Lip?
M	REGINALD	He pronounce it like Lippy.
M	GUARD	Well, you're outta here, Lippe.
M	TIM	I'm serious. Call any time-- on the mobile or home phone, though. The office number's no good anymore.
M	REGINALD	Thanks Tim. You're all right. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	TIM	Don't even say it, Deanzie-- no one butt rammed me or whatever in there.
M	DEAN	"Butt ram!" I love it!
M	DEAN (CONT'D)	Want your get out of jail free card back?
M	TIM	Not particularly.
M	DEAN	When I saw it, at first I was like, shit am I supposed to take money out of the account, or what?
M	TIM	Did you?
M	DEAN	Nah, it was more fun watching the smug fuck sweat. I told him I'd rat his pathetic ass out if he didn't drop the charges against you.
M	TIM	Sweet. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	RONALD	It's not as cool as I thought it'd be. I don't think this is even real wood.
M	DEAN	I'll show you some real wood.
M	TIM	Well.
F	JOAN	Deep subject. D'aar. Get it? I told you you were a hero, Lippe. Insurance Man saves the day!
M	TIM	Tss. Ruined it more like.
F	JOAN	True sign of a good day.
M	DEAN	Well, pal, it's been real.
M	TIM	I'm gonna miss you guys.
M	RONALD	Yeah. You bet.
M	DEAN	Listen, my cousin Bob-- guy made a truckload selling these little scented pine trees all the ragheads hang in their cabs? Fuckin' believe that? Anyhow, he's got a sweet cottage up on Lake of the Woods. Canada? I can use it whenever I want. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 I say we book it for June, before the mosquitoes go apeshit up there.
M	RONALD	More time in a tightly enclosed space with Ziegler. Gee, sign me up.
M	TIM	I think it sounds awesome.
M	RONALD	Actually, me too. The Ronimal could use a vacation.
M	DEAN	Done.
F	JOAN	So. Keep in touch. E-mail, all that good stuff.
M	TIM	You bet. You bet. You too.
F	JOAN	If you're ever-- not that you would be-- ever in Oh-my-God, Nebraska...
M	TIM	Yeah. Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. I used to watch that. Would be cool some day to see.
F	JOAN	Yeah. Look me up.
M	TIM	So.
M	TIM	So, did you do anything fun in Cedar Rapids...?
M	TIM	How's the walleye?
M	MILLIE	Decent. Not bad.
M	TIM	Meatloaf's on the dry side.
M	MILLIE	Mm.
M	TIM	What's...? Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	WADE	Shit, where were they hidin' the meatloaf...?
M	NEIGHBOR MAN (O.S.)	You're just gonna attract red squirrels with that junk, Tim.
M	TIM	How ya doin' there, Leslie?
M	LESLIE	Ach, I'm too old to give a shit.
M	LESLIE (CONT'D)	Bill Krogstad told me he's switching our policy to some fella down in Milwaukee. Allstate. Says I won't notice a bit of difference in coverage or nothin'.
M	TIM	No, you probably won't.
M	LESLIE	Mm. Anyhow, I told the cocksucker to go fuck himself. Says I'm going with Tim Lippe. A man I can trust. It's a good thing you're doin'-- keepin' work in Brown Valley.
M	TIM	I'm trying... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	LESLIE	Let me know when them red squirrels show up at your feeder. I'll borrow you my 22.
M	TIM (V.O.)	The chances we take in life are called risks.
M	TIM (V.O.)	We pay insurance companies premiums as a way of hedging our bets, in case those risks we take cause us or our property harm.
M	TIM (V.O.) (CONT'D)	That's the point of insurance-- so we can live and love life to the fullest.
M	TIM (CONT'D)	At Tim Lippe Insurance, we can't guarantee that you'll live your life without devastating losses. But we can give you peace of mind-- knowing that if something awful or unfortunate does happen-- we'll have you covered. Tim Lippe Insurance. Insuring your Home and your Hopes. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
M	RONALD	Can I be honest here, Tim?
M	TIM	You bet.
M	DEAN	What was with the fuckin' unicorn?
M	TIM	What? It represented hope...
M	RONALD	All's I'm saying is you might've wanted to hire an actor with some professional training...
M	DEAN	Jesus-- a retarded kid just sitting there yelling would've been better than you.
M	TIM	Aw, you're both a couple of a- holes...
