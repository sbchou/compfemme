M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MAN (O.S.)	No... please... There's no way...
M	MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Nothing... can defeat... A SHADOW FALLS across the sand. Then a second. One looks
M	MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Gojira.
M	MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me love you long time!
M	SECOND MAN (O.S.)	C'mon Jensen, you in or not?
M	JENSEN	And get cheated again?
M	POOCH	The Pooch don't cheat. The Pooch may lie, the Pooch may steal--
M	JENSEN	--the Pooch may refer to himself in the third person--
M	POOCH	--but the Pooch will not cheat.
M	JENSEN	The Pooch can rest easy, I was referring to Cougar. It's Liar's Poker, Jensen, how in the hell is the man gonna cheat you at Liar's Poker?
M	ROQUE	Cards. The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their
M	JENSEN	Got a feeling about this one, Roque.
M	ROQUE	Your mama had that feeling too.
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	Raise you.
M	POOCH	That the one with the hollow points?
M	ROQUE	Yup.
M	POOCH	Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then. JENSEN This even me up?
M	ROQUE	Exactly how many knives do you have, anyway?
M	POOCH	Cougar - your bet.
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Hey, losers!
M	WHIP PAN to	Clay. Mid-30's. Their leader, and you gotta be a bad-
M	CLAY	It's time...
M	CLAY	Authenticate and backtrace.
M	POOCH	Send us out to the middle of nowhere to "wait for instructions"...
M	JENSEN	We're good, this baby came out of the Kandahar Spook Station, controller's codename is Max. ROQUE This is an Agency gig? We don't get to pick what needs to be done. Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is running a terrorist assembly line out around the Khyber Pass--
M	JENSEN	I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.
M	CLAY	We find it, we paint it for a laser targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss.
M	ROQUE	For that we had to put on a blindfold and turn around three times?
M	POOCH	You'd rather take on fifty mujas with AK's?
M	ROQUE	I got eyes on Fadhil.
M	CLAY	Paint it.
M	POOCH	Call me Michelangelo.
M	JENSEN	Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed eyes on, target is designated.
M	RADIO VOICE (O.S.)	Roger, target acquired, exfil chopper is enroute. ETA to fireworks is eight minutes.
M	JENSEN	Roger, we'll break out the earplugs. So who wants to get a game? We got eight minutes-
M	COUGAR	Boss?
M	CLAY	Call it in.
M	JENSEN	Dropkick, children are at target site, repeat, we have eyes on children at target site - advise.
M	RADIO VOICE (O.S.)	Hold the line... Acknowledged, maintain position.
M	ROQUE	Maintain position? Colonel-
M	JENSEN	Dropkick, we strongly recommend cancellation of payload delivery-
M	RADIO VOICE (O.S.)	Abort order can only come from MISSION CONTROLLER-
M	CLAY	Mission Controller is Agency, Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max, so get him on the horn and-
M	RADIO VOICE (O.S.)	Already have, Pinball, your orders stand. Prep for exfil.
M	CLAY	Cougar? Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting equipment has suffered system failure, am calling an abort.
M	MAX (O.S.)	Well, that was stupid.
M	CLAY	Who is this? This is a secure MILITARY NETWORK-- Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin... Clay.
M	CLAY	Max? There are children on site-
M	MAX (O.S.)	And you think I didn't know that? Not the sharpest of knives in the drawer, are you? We locked coordinates the moment you painted; delivery will occur on schedule. Max out.
M	CLAY	Shit! Jensen, call the General at the Firebase, get him to abort-
M	JENSEN	Can't, they're jamming us-
M	ROQUE	Then contact the plane directly-
M	JENSEN	Negative, we're screwed! There's nothing we can do...
M	CLAY	There's something we can do.
M	ROQUE	Five against a fortress, and we've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire.
M	CLAY	So?
M	ROQUE	So, I'll drive.
M	POOCH	I guess we're going with the fifty mujas with AK's option after all!
M	CLAY	Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for the kids, the rest of us will be out in five-
M	ROQUE	-airstrike's in four and change-
M	CLAY	-out in four. On me!
M	CLAY	Get 'em out.
M	SOMETHING HORRIFIC	...shooooot meeee...
M	CLAY	You're American?
M	SOMETHING HORRIFIC	...Max sent you...
M	CLAY	How do you know that name? SOMETHING HORRIFIC ...was IA Field Ops hunting rogue agents... Max caught me...
M	CLAY	Max is rogue?
M	SOMETHING HORRIFIC	You're off-mission aren't you?
M	SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)	What's the mission? CLAY Fadhil.
M	SOMETHING HORRIFIC	Max doesn't care about Fadhil... He's cleaning up the mess. You're his mop. I'm the mission.... Kill me...
M	CLAY	I can get you out-
M	SOMETHING HORRIFIC	Already dead... Kill ME-
M	SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)	Thaaaank...
M	COUGAR	Mercy.
M	COUGAR (CONT'D)	Run.
M	POOCH	Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?
M	ROQUE	What kind of blast radius we looking at? Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	DRIVE. MUCH. FASTER.
M	JENSEN	I think we're in the clear-
M	POOCH	Uh, Coug?
M	JENSEN	Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours?
M	POOCH	Exfil incoming. How are we gonna explain the kids, Colonel?
M	POOCH (CONT'D)	Colonel? The kids. What do we tell 'em?
M	CLAY	Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately-
M	BLACKHAWK PILOT	Negative, our orders are to transport a five-man team only.
M	CLAY	You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die?
M	BLACKHAWK PILOT	Not enough room for them and you...
M	CLAY	Then it's them. Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and
M	POOCH	Cute little buggers. Hope they can make it to our court-martial.
M	ROQUE	Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel?
M	CLAY	Jensen, see if you can cut into that Blackhawk's chatter--I want to know if he rats us out.
M	POOCH	So, how we getting back? Hitchhike? Magic carpet? I say magic carpet...
M	ROQUE	Guess they hustled up some air support after all - that's a Pakistani MiG up there...
M	JENSEN	Guys... This is bad...
M	MIG PILOT (O.S.)	Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked, twelve o'clock low... Their eyes go wide with understanding....
M	MAX (O.S.)	Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit. Fox One.
M	POOCH	Auto-rotate, go with it, you can still put her down if you-
M	MAX (O.S.)	And again.
M	CLAY	NO!
M	MIG PILOT (O.S.)	...Fox Two. The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK FENNEL What are you talking about "MAX?"
M	CLAY	He set up the Operation-
M	FENNEL	There was no operation! You were never radioed orders!
M	CLAY	I talked to him!
M	FENNEL	You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is "MAX?" Wait - are you saying you're Max?
M	CLAY	What?
M	FENNEL	Colonel, Max is an Agency code for a rogue agent or operation-
M	CLAY	What are you talking-
M	LARGE MAN (O.S.)	There is no specific Max.
M	WADE	"Max" is catch-all for exactly what you've been accused of. Terminology's been around since the 50's.
M	CLAY	We didn't kill those kids, Wade. Wade studies him. Finally:
M	WADE	I believe you.
M	FENNEL	Stay here. We'll be back.
M	POOCH	Wade left his suitcase.
M	ROQUE	Ah, shit...
M	CLAY	Jensen?
M	JENSEN	I'm not good with bombs, man-
M	CLAY	I don't care--Roque, Pooch, get those bars off!
M	JENSEN	Oh, shit. Oh, shit...
M	CLAY	Time?
M	JENSEN	It's a remote detonator--enough for them to get clear, maybe ten MORE SECONDS-
M	CLAY	CAN YOU-
M	JENSEN	I told you, I'm not good with bombs! How are those bars coming?
M	POOCH	Hurry...
M	ROQUE	Shut up.
M	POOCH	Hurry...
M	ROQUE	Shut up...
M	ROQUE	You lost again.
M	CLAY	We lost again.
M	ROQUE	You placed the bet.
M	CLAY	You gave me the money.
M	ROQUE	Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't it?
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	That makes, what, three in a row?
M	CLAY	Four. ROQUE You know where you're messing up? You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds.
M	CLAY	Yeah, I've just gone crazy with that approach.
M	ROQUE	Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win. We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. - could this get any more sleazy?
M	CLAY	Maybe if we were drinking.
M	ROQUE	You're not drinking?
M	CLAY	We'll stay two more days, try to get some of the cash back.
M	ROQUE	Then what?
M	CLAY	Miami. Jai-Alai.
M	ROQUE	I can't take much more of this.
M	CLAY	We're on the run. It occasionally INVOLVES RUNNING-
M	ROQUE	I'm serious. Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds- I'm at the point where I'm thinking we ought to try to reach out to the Company...
M	CLAY	All we did was say the word "Max" and they blew up a building. CIA even gets a whiff of where we're at, they'll call in an airstrike. Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low.
M	ROQUE	Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel anymore.
M	CLAY	Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead-
M	ROQUE	Like the others? Least I still talk to them. You pushed them away. "Max this, Max that" - we never even saw the guy, Clay-
M	CLAY	We heard his voice. Guy with a voice is a guy with a throat. And if he's got a throat...
M	ROQUE	We're hiding out in the parking lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You actually think we're in any position to take on some shadowy CIA super- spook? ROQUE-
M	ROQUE	No, it's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops! Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can set up communications by the slide!
M	CLAY	Go. Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the
M	ROQUE	I was there too. I remember. But he won. We lost. Maybe it's time for a new game.
M	PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE GUY	Yabba Dabba Doo...
F	AISHA	Men.
M	AISHA (CONT'D)	How's the steak?
M	CLAY	Meaty.
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Want a bite?
F	AISHA	I don't eat red meat.
M	CLAY	Why not?
F	AISHA	Slows me down.
M	CLAY	Okay.
F	AISHA	You got nice arms.
M	CLAY	I know you?
F	AISHA	Relax, slugger... I like arms. That's all.
M	CLAY	Do I not look relaxed?
F	AISHA	No. Think we can change that?
F	AISHA	Wow, it's everything a girl could dream of. Got a bathroom?
M	CLAY	No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom. AISHA You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here?
F	AISHA	So what brings you to Florida?
M	CLAY	Convention. Convention for what?
M	CLAY	...Air conditioners.
F	AISHA	They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners?
M	CLAY	You'd be surprised.
F	AISHA	Bet I would. Where were we?
M	CLAY	You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track... Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...
F	AISHA	Saw me there did you?
M	CLAY	Uh-huh...
F	AISHA	Didn't see me at the McDonald's though... I have a proposition for you...
M	AISHA (CONT'D)	Just hear me out. I don't want to hurt you.
M	CLAY	You're not going to.
F	AISHA	Yes, I am.
M	AISHA (CONT'D)	Room's on fire.
M	CLAY	Noticed. What do you want?
F	AISHA	Your life. Back.
M	CLAY	You want to clarify that?
F	AISHA	Max. I can help you.
M	CLAY	I'm listening.
M	CLAY	How'd you find me?
F	AISHA	It's not too tough if you know where to look. You guys aren't exactly subtle.
M	CLAY	How'd you know I was alive?
F	AISHA	Counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in Karachi. Not nearly enough for five men.
M	CLAY	Who else knows?
F	AISHA	That you're alive? Just me. CLAY So what's to stop me from putting a bullet in your head?
F	AISHA	You want Max and I can tell you how to get him.
M	CLAY	Max is up to something big, isn't he? Agency wouldn't have sent you otherwise.
F	AISHA	Nice try, but I'm working alone here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't need your help. Ready for the important part?
M	AISHA (CONT'D)	There is a plane.
M	CLAY	Okay.
F	AISHA	This plane contains a truck. CLAY Okay.
F	AISHA	This truck contains a cargo.
M	CLAY	Right.
F	AISHA	This cargo is very important.
M	CLAY	Is this a riddle?
F	AISHA	This cargo belongs to Max. You steal the cargo, Max comes looking for it, you grab Max.
M	CLAY	What a brilliant plan, and oh, so simple too. What's the cargo? Right. So you want me to steal some super secret cargo known only to you and the bad guy, and I'm supposed to do this because you know the name Max and look good in a pair of jeans? Sorry, sister.
F	AISHA	Hey! You really think I look good in these jeans?
M	CLAY	Bye...
F	AISHA	Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to fund his off the books ops. And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil. Oh... does that name mean something to you?
M	AISHA (CONT'D)	He used you to kill Fadhil and take over his operation, that's right. What did you think you were doing there in the first place? Fighting for truth and justice?
M	CLAY	How do I know I can trust you?
F	AISHA	Check my background. I'm an ex- Company hitter. First job was a junior field officer in Shanghai. You can Google it under Shanghai Hilton Decapitation.
M	CLAY	I mostly Google porn. Then?
F	AISHA	Two Chinese and an Italian arms dealer in Bangkok. With my hands.
M	CLAY	Show-off. Then?
F	AISHA	Then I stopped auditioning for you. This is a check for ten grand-
M	CLAY	We're not mercenaries.
F	AISHA	Operational capital, that's all. You've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You're not gonna get another. You want Max, this is it. He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it.
M	AISHA (CONT'D)	Intel on the shipment. You check it out, you check me out, you decide - are you in or not?
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	You know we cannot do this... We cannot do what you ask...
M	MAX	Tell me - is this a moral issue or a financial issue?
M	FAT SCIENTIST	A moral issue.
M	MAX	Really? You object morally to this deal?
M	FAT SCIENTIST	Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave... Okay, here's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing "No." I'm hearing "Leave," and I'm hearing "I'm sorry." Is that what I'm hearing?
M	FAT SCIENTIST	Please... you must leave...
M	MAX	Right. Okay, so that is what I'm hearing. Now, I want you to listen. Listen carefully because I want you to hear this. Wade?
M	MAX (CONT'D)	What the hell was that?
M	WADE	You gave me the nod.
M	MAX	A "hit him in the face" nod, not a "throw him out the window" nod.
M	WADE	I thought that's what you wanted.
M	MAX	At most--at most that was a "break his fingers" nod. I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius. Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window.
M	WADE	Sorry... MAX I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful...
M	MAX (CONT'D)	...then again, it seemed to have had the desired effect - toss Short Round out next.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	Wait!
M	SHORT SCIENTIST (CONT'D)	We have a different moral perspective than our late colleague.
M	MAX	The hell you say. I need one to test and one to use.
M	SHORT SCIENTEST	One to test?
M	MAX	Of course one to test - you think I trust you?
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	We will need much money.
M	MAX	You will have much money.
M	MAX	Call our people at Goliath, tell them we'll have a special package arriving on the 17th.
M	ROQUE (O.S.)	So this is what your girl came up with, huh?
M	CLAY	Better than a ball pit...
M	ROQUE	You sure you're thinking clear on this? I know you. When you slip, it's always cause of a woman.
M	CLAY	Name one time that- ROQUE Carla.
M	CLAY	Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's husband was the problem-
M	ROQUE	Carla's husband wasn't the one who SHOT YOU-
M	CLAY	Okay. Yes. She shot me. But only in the leg.
M	ROQUE	What about Emma?
M	CLAY	Emma doesn't count, we never slept together.
M	ROQUE	Because she put a bomb in your car.
M	CLAY	I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship.
M	ROQUE	And now this chick, first time you meet her, burns down our hotel. Also, she kills people for a living. These are not good signs...
M	CLAY	I'm clear, Roque.
M	ROQUE	You better be. Or we're done.
M	POOCH	Damn. We missed you too.
M	POOCH (CONT'D)	So what's this I hear about Clay gettin' us killed over a girl?
M	AISHA (O.S.)	Been a long time since anyone called me a girl.
M	POOCH	Jesus, Lady! Ten outta ten for stealth and shit, but next time could you just knock?
M	ROQUE	How long you been back there?
F	AISHA	Long enough. She put a bomb in your car?
M	CLAY	She was volatile. Aisha, meet Pooch, Roque, and Cougar.
F	AISHA	Really? You can't hang out with anyone just named "Phil"?
M	JENSEN	Hail, hail, the gang's all here! Colonel. Roque. Pooch. Silent Bob. Hottie. I'm gonna need a moment alone with the boys if you don't mind, but I'd like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later?
F	AISHA	I'd expect no less. Have fun...
M	CLAY	What do you have on her?
M	JENSEN	Besides a pants-busting crush? Her intel checks out. The cargo will be arriving here in two days.
M	ROQUE	Wow, I completely trust her now.
M	CLAY	What else?
M	JENSEN	Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad was white devil... oh, and CIA's got a kill order out on her. As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD-- pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick amscrayed.
M	POOCH	Why?
M	JENSEN	Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special project... "Codename: MAX". A moment as this sinks in.
M	POOCH	They want to wet her cause she's lookin' into Max. That sounds familiar...
M	ROQUE	Could those files-
M	JENSEN	-have been planted for us to find? CIA timestamp, digital watermark... Someone would've had to go to a lot of trouble, and I mean a lot, to fool me.
M	CLAY	I say we go with her. Pooch?
M	POOCH	I'm in.
M	CLAY	Jensen?
M	JENSEN	Hell yeah. Cougs?
M	ROQUE	For now.
M	JENSEN	Hot damn! Back with the Colonel, doing another bid for God and COUNTRY-
M	ROQUE	Country turned her back on us, and God can screw. This one's for us.
M	CLAY	And anyone who calls me "Colonel" better be ready to take a beating or an order. We ain't soldiers anymore.
M	POOCH	So what's the plan, my civilian brothers?
M	CLAY	Sleep. We start tomorrow.
M	JENSEN	Start where?
M	CLAY	We're going bird hunting.
M	MAX (V.O.)	It used to be so simple. A post 9/11 world...
M	MAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)	As a country we spoke with one voice, moved with one purpose. We had a wicked boner for doing the right thing, and now look at us!
M	MAX	90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we're too busy losing our nerve to notice. It's Us versus Them and right now my money would be on them...
M	MAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Wasn't it Thomas Jefferson who once said the tree of freedom must be watered with etcetera, etcetera? We need to wake people up, Wade. We need to hit them in the face, angry up the blood, give them their balls back. We TRACK WITH our lead monkey up to something very un- We need to give them a ten megaton reality check. Boom Boom Boom Boom...
M	MAX (CONT'D)	I think it's safe to say it works!
M	MAX (CONT'D)	Jeez, talk about hard to impress...
M	WADE	The Company's with you on this?
M	MAX	Kinda... Sorta...
M	MAX (CONT'D)	You know the drill, they don't like to know how the sausages get made. What do you care? WADE I don't. Just want to make sure everyone gets paid.
M	MAX	The money's coming from our Afghanistan operation. And what the Company doesn't know won't hurt them.
M	WADE	Unless they're within the blast radius.
M	MAX	We're gonna saving our country, Wade. The United States of America will benefit greatly from what we're doing.
M	WADE	I was born in Quebec.
M	MAX	Jesus, fine - we're saving North America, does that make you happy? Just get it done.
M	RADIO TRANSMISSION (V.O.)	Base One, this is Cavalier 415. Sector eight perimeter clear, proceeding to sector nine...
M	JENSEN	Roger that Cav 415, we have a report of a civilian vehicle breakdown on U.S. 70, sector nine, grid four. Please assist as required.
M	DRIVER	Army of one, my ass. Goddamn Triple A service... Need a hand, buddy?
M	POOCH	Appreciate it.
M	SOLDIER 1	AAOW! Something just bit me!
M	SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)	Is this...?
M	CLAY	Go.
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Make the call.
M	JENSEN	Base One, this is Cavalier 415! We have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle! Carvey's dead an' Freeman's hurt bad! He's messed up his neck! He can't move! Oh god, it's horrible! We need medevac immediate! HE'S GOT KIDS, BASE ONE, HE'S GOT KIDS!
M	BASE ONE (O.S.)	Roger, Cavalier 415! We're scrambling a chopper, hang in there! Jensen, all smiles, looks up at Clay.
M	JENSEN	Robert De Niro who?
M	POOCH	Sleeping like babies.
M	ROQUE	What about their ride?
M	CLAY	Flip it. TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage
M	POOCH	What do you think's up with that "don't call me Colonel" stuff?
M	JENSEN	Classic loss of identity. Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure. It was his way of measuring the good he did in the world. Without it, he's just another loser like the rest of us. You know there's a website where you can download MP3's of donkeys farting? How cool is that?
M	BASE ONE (O.S.)	Cavalier 415 this is Medevac Delta. Be advised, we are airborne and in- bound to your position!
M	CLAY	All right, everyone get into character...
M	JENSEN	Lot of work to bum a ride.
M	ROQUE	Shut up, Jensen.
M	JENSEN	You shut up, Roque. You're dead, I'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can't.
M	ROQUE	Stop talking or I'll break your neck for real.
M	JENSEN	Seriously, you have to get more into your role! Dead guy! No talking! Dead guy!
M	CLAY	Here we go...
M	PILOT	Base One, this is Medevac Delta. We have visual on Cavalier 415.
M	EMT	Alright buddy, we're gonna get you patched up in no time...
M	JENSEN	Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been gut shot...
M	EMT	Sure, in Iraq. What a mess...
M	JENSEN	Means you know what's coming to you if try to play hero. Now, lose the radio mic, Bones.
M	PILOT ONE	What are they jawing about out there? We're burning fuel--
M	POOCH	You heard of car-jacked? You've just been chopper-jacked, my man.
M	PILOT ONE	You're robbing the US Army?
M	POOCH	When he says it out loud, it does sound kinda ridiculous...
M	CLAY	Where's my wild goose?
M	JENSEN	We're all set here. Ready to take a giant step for... well, for guys who steal stuff, I guess.
M	CLAY	Hit it.
M	JENSEN	Beautiful. Let 'em chase that. Medevac Delta, this is Base One. What's your situation, over?
M	POOCH	Time to move.
M	DRUGGED SOLDIER	...Well, shit.
M	POOCH	...no, what you want is a gas turbine generator running a force- fed rectifier unit, hook it up to the fuel tank...
M	JENSEN	So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush, huh? That must've been rough.
F	AISHA	Uh-huh...
M	JENSEN	Got any hobbies?
F	AISHA	When I was a girl, I collected human ears. I had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them. The dog was good eating, though. A beat.
M	JENSEN	I'm gonna go somewhere else now.
F	AISHA	Are small arms gonna be a problem?
M	POOCH	It's taken care of - we lined the hull with half inch steel plate.
M	ROQUE	Which brings us to our next question...
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	What's your angle in this?
M	CLAY	Roque...
F	AISHA	I'm giving you a chance to get even. That's all you need to know.
M	ROQUE	I'm gonna shoot her, Clay.
M	CLAY	No, you're not.
M	ROQUE	Yes, I am.
M	CLAY	No.
M	ROQUE	Right now.
M	CLAY	See?
M	ROQUE	She's coming with us. And if anything feels like a set-up, I put a bullet in her skull. Sound fair?
F	AISHA	Oh, completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers.
M	ROQUE	You're Muslim?
F	AISHA	You know, you are a sharp one--and don't let any of these other boys tell you different.
M	ROQUE	I don't like this.
M	CLAY	I picked up on that.
M	POOCH	I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks we're dead. We show up alive and kickin', start waving our dicks around in public, they're gonna make it their business to bury us. They'll call us terrorists, all KINDSA SHIT-
M	CLAY	What do you think we are now? Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max- ROQUE What if it doesn't? What if we never get face to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever?
M	POOCH	Hell, let's just say it out loud... We do this, we're declaring war on the Central Intelligence Agency.
M	COUGAR	They started it.
M	FENNEL	As of this moment, the truck is designated an extraterritorial zone of immunity. Under no circumstances whatsoever are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before it's secure in the compound - to do so would be considered an act of treason and punishable as such.
M	LIDDY	Understood and acknowledged, sir. As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG...
M	WADE	Ten men ride with the package and another ten ride chase.
M	WADE (CONT'D)	Let's go.
M	CLAY	Are we wired?
M	JENSEN	Like Belushi. Target is westbound. Heading for the bridge...
M	CLAY (O.S.)	Take em'.
M	SWAT DRIVER	Shit, I'm losing it!
M	WADE	Form a defensive perimeter around the truck!
M	FENNEL	They're out of their minds, there's no way off this bridge...
M	WADE	Masks on! Secure the package!
M	SWAT GUY	Where are they? I can't see them-
M	FENNEL	Code RED! We are under attack! Need Chopper Support right now!
M	CONTROL (V.O.)	Acknowledged, EVAC is enroute!
M	WADE	Cavalry's here!
M	WADE (CONT'D)	Move! Point cover! Go, go!
M	CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)	This is Chopper Support--we are inbound your position, ETA five minutes! Hang in there! As a HORRIFIED LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade's face
M	FENNEL	What the hell? It's welded shut!
M	SWAT GUY	The windows too! We're sealed in! We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in
M	FENNEL	We're down, okay! You go the second the ramp lowers! Hit them hard, three round bursts, center mass!
F	AISHA	Open the valve.
M	FENNEL	These guys are about to get the surprise of their lives... What the hell they trying to do, drown us?
M	SOLDIER 1	Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!
M	FENNEL	Eat the ground, or they blow your head off!
M	CLAY	I don't think so.
M	FENNEL	First and only warning, Clay!
M	CLAY	Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think about it. AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died.
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Things'll kill you.
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Good boys. Now, let's see what kind of cargo you got in there.
M	FENNEL	Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we all die. Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose.
M	CLAY	I'm already dead, remember?
M	Clay turns back to	
M	JENSEN	Goliath the oil company?
F	AISHA	It must be how he moves the drugs...
M	ROQUE	Great. The super evil bad guy is in bed with the world's largest oil company. That's just fabulous.
M	POOCH	You want me to go ask Fennel the combination?
M	JENSEN	Nah, I can bypass no problem.
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	Voila! Ten million dollars of horse, comin' up! Revealing a THERMO-NUCLEAR WARHEAD.
M	POOCH	Is that...?
M	CLAY	Yeah.
M	POOCH	Is that...?
M	CLAY	Yeah. Jensen, you're up.
M	JENSEN	Huh?
M	CLAY	The bomb.
M	JENSEN	But I'm not good with bombs...
M	CLAY	Get better.
M	JENSEN	Okay. Okay. Nukes. That's a nuke. Who makes nukes? Department of Defense. DOD Mainframe. I gotta hack the DOD MAINFRAME- SHOULD WE-
M	JENSEN	It would really be good if you didn't talk right now- get that casing off for me.
M	POOCH	What if that sets it off?
M	CLAY	Then we die thirty seconds early - do it.
M	POOCH	I got wires - red, blue, green, white, yellow-
M	JENSEN	Okay, just hold position!
M	POOCH	There's also pink- JENSEN Hold position!
F	AISHA	Are you trying to make this more dramatic?
M	JENSEN	Almost... Almost... Shit!
F	AISHA	What? JENSEN Computer crashed!
M	POOCH	Are you kidding me?
M	JENSEN	Yes, cause this is the time for HUMOR-
M	JENSEN	I told you, I'm not good at bombs!
M	CLAY	Do you have time to reboot?
M	POOCH	Okay, someone pick a color!
F	AISHA	Pull out all the wires.
M	ROQUE	What?
F	AISHA	You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged it--pull out all the wires.
M	JENSEN	Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer...
M	POOCH	You think?
M	ROQUE	Did you know?
F	AISHA	I just saved our lives-
M	ROQUE	Did you know?
F	AISHA	Of course not!
M	ROQUE	Where the hell are you-
M	CLAY	Fennel.
M	FENNEL	Max thinks the country's lost it's way, gone soft in the War on Terror! This is his solution!
M	CLAY	Elaborate.
M	FENNEL	He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target, pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again! The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot! POOCH What was the target?
M	FENNEL	I CAN'T- The Mall of America! Christ!
M	FENNEL (CONT'D)	I'm serious! It's his sense of humor! He told us we could choose between there and Epcot Center... Holy shit, it's like we were framed by Dr. No...
F	AISHA	What about Goliath?
M	JENSEN	Yeah, what would an oil company want with the Middle East?
M	FENNEL	The ships that service their offshore oil rigs are exempt from US Customs! It's how Max gets the drugs in and out of the country-
M	ROQUE	This is conspiracy theory bullshit-
M	FENNEL	It's not! There's proof!
M	CLAY	Where?
M	FENNEL	Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments!
M	JENSEN	Come on, dude, they'd be morons to keep records of shit like this-
M	FENNEL	It's on a stand-alone hard drive! It's their insurance policy against Max - they know he's crazy, this way they have something on him!
M	CLAY	So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing?
M	FENNEL	Yes!
M	CLAY	Can you get us this drive?
M	FENNEL	I don't know where it is! They don't let me have access! But-
M	FENNEL (CONT'D)	No, wait! Please don't kill-
M	CLAY	I say we hit Goliath headquarters.
M	ROQUE	And do what - go after this non- existent hard drive?
M	CLAY	We find out if it exists. If it does, we steal it and trade it for immunity.
M	ROQUE	That's your plan?
M	CLAY	You got a better one? Max gives us back our lives or we upload the data to the net, show the American people what's being done in their names.
M	ROQUE	Why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade?
M	CLAY	You want to give it back to him?
M	ROQUE	I want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky-
M	CLAY	It's not happening.
M	ROQUE	So you want to take down Goliath now? Then who? McDonald's? American Airlines? Microsoft?
M	CLAY	You don't want Max to pay?
M	ROQUE	I want my life back! This is supposed to be us getting clear - not saving the world!
M	POOCH	ROQUE-
M	ROQUE	We're not the goddamn good guys anymore! I love you guys, but I had a life before this shit, and I sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights!
M	CLAY	Don't raise your voice at me-
M	ROQUE	I will raise whatever the hell I want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio-
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	I'm gonna cut your head off...
M	POOCH	I say we hit Goliath. Jensen?
M	JENSEN	Goliath. Cougs?
M	CLAY	Aisha?
M	ROQUE	She doesn't get a vote-
F	AISHA	Goliath.
M	POOCH	Put it away...
M	CLAY	You want your life back, you're gonna have to steal it. We hit them in two days.
M	JENSEN	Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight?
M	POOCH	So what do we do about the nuke? Did I just actually say that?
F	AISHA	I have an idea...
M	PATROLMAN (O.S.)	Holy- Sarge, come quick!
M	MATCH WITH:	
M	WADE	That's gonna be a quick trial...
M	MAX	Wonderful guy, salt of the earth, he'll be missed--who took my bomb, Wade?
M	WADE	You're not gonna like it... MAX Because I've been such a fan of how things have gone up till now?
M	MAX (CONT'D)	Who the hell are these people?
M	WADE	Colonel Clay and his unit. You had them killed three years ago?
M	MAX	I also had several African nations overthrown three years ago, I'm a BUSY GUY- WADE The Jamal al-Fadhil situation?
M	MAX	Shit.
M	WADE	Yeah.
M	MAX	Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
M	WADE	So what's the plan?
M	MAX	What's the plan? The plan is - get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
M	WADE	Okay.
M	MAX	Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to try a third go-around?
M	WADE	WE'RE CLEAR- to do is get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. You get that, right?
M	WADE	I get it.
M	MAX	And Wade?
M	MAX (CONT'D)	We're gonna need a new bomb.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	We appreciate you meeting us in a single story facility.
M	WADE	No problem.
M	WADE (CONT'D)	I look at that entire incident as your standard "getting to know" each other business orientation.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	I agree. Now that we know each other, know, please, that if you come near me with any more of that Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit, you will be fed to my dogs.
M	WADE	Fair enough, Doc. Can we now move past the verbal aggression and get into some business?
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	You want another device. One billion dollars is now the price. One billion dollars cash.
M	WADE	That's going to be difficult.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	Life the way you people want to live it is very difficult, Mr. Wade. You want less difficult move to my country, study Hinduism. Meditate. Cultivate serenity. Much less difficult. You want to buy atomic bombs... I'm afraid that is a more difficult way of life.
M	WADE	He wants one billion in cash.
M	MAX	That's a lot of a paper routes...
M	WADE	Can we swing it?
M	MAX	Not even close.
M	WADE	The Company?
M	MAX	Won't give it to us willingly... You get that six man team together like I asked?
M	WADE	Yeah.
M	MAX	Change of plans. Kill them.
M	WADE	Kill them?
M	MAX	Or fire them, whichever's easier.
M	WADE	Honestly? Firing them.
M	MAX	Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy. What I need- wait. Did you give them intel on Clay's people?
M	WADE	Well, yeah.
M	MAX	Aaaand we're back to killing them.
M	WADE	Fine, I'll kill them - what are we doing instead?
M	MAX	Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are you related to them?
M	WADE	Actually, one of them, yes.
M	MAX	By blood?
M	WADE	A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill him, what are we doing?
M	MAX	It's not what we're doing, it's what Clay is going to do for us...
M	WADE	And that is?
M	MAX	Get us our billion dollars...
M	CLAY	I was just going over the plan.
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	You want to go over the plan?
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Let's go over the plan...
F	AISHA	So, what really happened to you in Afghanistan?
M	CLAY	That's not for you. Why do you want Max dead?
F	AISHA	He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?
M	CLAY	No.
F	AISHA	When you tell me about Afghanistan? I'll tell you about Max.
M	CLAY	Fine. It's hot. There's lots of sand. Your turn.
F	AISHA	Why were you alone when I found you?
M	CLAY	The guys got sick of it.
F	AISHA	Sick of what?
M	CLAY	Of hearing about Max. Of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do. They wanted to be around their families. Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a wife and daughters.
F	AISHA	And he hasn't told them he is alive?
M	CLAY	Would you? The people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger? Aisha, side-stepping the question:
F	AISHA	So Roque has no one.
M	CLAY	He's got me.
F	AISHA	And you have...
M	CLAY	Enough hate to get us both through the day. He stuck with me when no one else would. And I ain't the easiest guy to stick with. AISHA If you two really fought, he would kill you, I think.
M	CLAY	You think.
F	AISHA	I'm almost sure of it.
M	CLAY	Why?
F	AISHA	Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself.
M	CLAY	And you think that's a weakness.
F	AISHA	I know it is. Law of the jungle.
M	CLAY	We're not in the jungle. Oh, yes we are...
M	ROQUE	Well, that's just great.
M	POOCH	We're not going anywhere until you two squash this shit.
M	CLAY	Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Sorry I hit you.
M	POOCH	Good. Roque?
M	POOCH (CONT'D)	Roque?
M	ROQUE	Sorry I threatened to cut your head off.
M	POOCH	Verrrry good. Now don't you two feel better?
M	CLAY AND ROQUE	No.
M	POOCH	I don't give a shit, I do. Now, let's go watch Jensen single- handedly knock over the largest oil company on the planet...
M	JENSEN	I got jungle fever, you've got jungle fever, we've got jungle fever, we're in love...
M	JENSEN	...she's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy, ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love... Yo! Package for Henderson!
M	RECEPTIONIST	Excuse me one moment- I'll take that, thank you.
M	JENSEN	No can do, chica, gotta put it in his hands. He's gotta sign.
M	RECEPTIONIST	I'm sorry--could you say that again?
M	JENSEN	Babydoll, I'm on the clock here!
M	RECEPTIONIST	Forty fifth floor.
M	JENSEN	I got jungle fever, you've got jungle fever, we've got jungle fever, we're in love...
M	JENSEN	Mr. Henderson, please.
F	SECRETARY	Who's calling, please?
M	JENSEN	Richard Hertz from Internal Security.
F	SECRETARY	One moment, please...
M	JENSEN	Ladies... hi.
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	Liking the angle of the dangle?
M	HENDERSON	This is Henderson. JENSEN Richard Hertz from Internal Security. If you'd be kind enough to make your way down to the lobby?
M	HENDERSON	Uh... Can I ask what this is about?
M	JENSEN	It's a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	individual exposing himself to women in the elevators--best discussed in person. If you'd just head on down...
M	JENSEN	Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support. Is Henderson around? I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-
F	SECRETARY	Oh, you just missed him by like two seconds. Can you come back in like an hour or so?
M	JENSEN	Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs breathing down my neck. They want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a sudden. Five minutes and I'll be out of your hair!
F	SECRETARY	Security?
M	JENSEN	According to this, the drive exists, Clay.
M	CLAY	You're sure?
M	JENSEN	Abso-tootly.
M	CLAY	Is it in the building?
M	JENSEN	No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta be a remote location, stand-alone. I'm checking their security logs-- wherever they've detailed the most guys is probably where it'll be...
M	SECURITY GUARD 1 (O.S.)	"Skippy"? Show me some ID. Real easy.
M	JENSEN	Whoa! Take it easy. You're the-
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	Get me out of here, Clay... There's a fire exit thirty yards north of your position.
M	BIG SECURITY 1 (O.S.)	Freeze like a statue, pretty boy!
M	JENSEN	I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal weapon... Jensen turns on the big fellah.
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	It was this secret government project. They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff. Anal stuff. Turned me into a dangerous Telekinetic. As the old saying goes - you don't start none... there won't be none.
M	BIG SECURITY 1	Telekinetic your way out of this...
M	JENSEN	Bang.
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	Boom.
M	BIG SECURITY 2	You broke my ribs...
M	THIRD GUARD	Please- d-don't shoot...
M	JENSEN	Face down, or I'll make your hearts stop beating with my mind.
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	Thanks, Coug...
M	COUGAR	De Nada.
M	MAX	By your boys?
M	WADE	They're not "my boys". I don't like this. I say we grab Clay and kill the rest.
M	MAX	If you can find them-
M	WADE	I can.
M	MAX	Why, Mr. Wade... methinks you have a secret. Okay. Put a fire team together.
M	WADE	You're sure? You're not going to call me in two hours and have me kill them? I'm on it...
M	JENSEN	Everything on Goliath - security, personnel history, the works. Aisha's brow furrows at this. Only we notice.
M	CLAY	Where's the drive being kept?
M	JENSEN	Port of New York, baby. Total stand alone facility, and they're spending 30K a day on onsite security - you don't drop that kinda green to just guard oil.
M	ROQUE	What are we up against?
M	JENSEN	Let me check, I--oh, shit...
M	CLAY	What's "oh, shit"?
M	JENSEN	They've hired Par-Sec. A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them.
M	CLAY	Oh, shit...
F	AISHA	Who's Par-Sec?
M	JENSEN	Paradigm Security Services. Ex- Special Forces.
M	POOCH	Basically guys like Cougar but without the warm and cuddly side.
M	CLAY	Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck...
M	JENSEN	Our drive is being guarded by military trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers... Am I the only one who's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags?
M	Silence.	
M	CLAY	Comb that drive for every last scrap of info. We're on a plane for New York tomorrow...
M	CLAY	Oh, hi. Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table. Both with laptops.
M	ROQUE	Thought you guys'd be back at the hotel.
M	POOCH	Couldn't sleep.
M	ROQUE	Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one?
M	POOCH	No thanks.
M	JENSEN	You won't believe how detailed these files are. Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts-
M	ROQUE	Life insurance?
M	JENSEN	Yeah.
M	ROQUE	What's the biggest payout?
M	JENSEN	Gotta be wrongful death...
M	ROQUE	Pretty much what we're gonna be risking. What are you doing up?
M	POOCH	Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.
M	ROQUE	The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED
M	POOCH	When we first went over in 2001, Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right? Only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been cleaned out.
M	ROQUE	Military neighborhood...
M	POOCH	No doubt. And Tina's four at the time, and what she can't understand is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow. So Jolene sings her the song, right? To show her where the idea comes from. And when she's all done, Tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye and says "that's the dumbest song I ever heard." So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in
M	ROQUE	Thought that counts, right?
M	POOCH	Yeah...
M	POOCH (CONT'D)	Jolene dated a guy last summer. Didn't turn into anything and I sure as hell can't blame her, but that man was in my house, Roque. I know you're not a hundred percent on this op, but if it can get me back to them...
M	ROQUE	I hear you, man.
M	JENSEN	Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath exec ever - 14 million and it was wrongful death - Vice President of Operations in Afghanistan, three years ago, paid to his daughter... We're going to need to drive fast...
M	CLAY	You really want to know about Afghanistan?
M	JENSEN	You think she's gonna kill him?
M	POOCH AND ROQUE	Uh-uh. No way.
M	JENSEN	Yeah, I think so too...
F	AISHA	And this man you found in the basement - he was your true target? CLAY Max's true target. Yeah.
F	AISHA	And you spoke with him?
M	CLAY	He knew we were off mission. He knew Max wanted him dead...
F	AISHA	Did he beg?
M	CLAY	Excuse me?
F	AISHA	The man in the basement. Did he beg for his life?
M	CLAY	He begged to die--why are you asking me this?
M	JENSEN	Freeze!
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	She's his daughter, Clay! The guy in the basement's daughter and she's got a gun and it's pointed... ...at my dick! Her gun is pointed at my dick!
F	AISHA	Would you rather I pointed it at your head? JENSEN I know it makes no sense, but actually yes.
M	CLAY	Wait.
M	ROQUE	Shit, she's got back-up!
M	COUGAR	Run.
M	ROQUE	Go, go, go!
M	POOCH	Think that got her?
M	CLAY	She ain't that lucky. Jensen, status! JENSEN My dick remains unshot!
M	ROQUE	Here they come...
M	CLAY	Somebody shoot something!
M	JENSEN	I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug, do you have a plan? He's got a plan!
M	POOCH	Stop yelling at the sniper! THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the Coming in for LANDING...
M	WADE	They got away.
M	MAX	So?
M	MAX (CONT'D)	We know exactly where they're going, Wade. Port of New York, for their big final awesome stand against the forces of evil where they die.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	Do you have the money?
M	MAX	Jesus, always with the money! So impersonal! How are you? How have you been?
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window. How have you been?
M	MAX	Can't complain. I'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car... I think you're a freak. Too much Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy football.
M	MAX	Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	We have your ordinance. You have twenty four hours to get the money.
M	MAX	Time to go make a withdrawal...
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	New change of plan. You stay.
M	MAX	I've got to go get your money.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	He'll get your money. You stay right here.
M	MAX	God, are you short. SHORT SCIENTIST Twenty three hours, fifty nine minutes...
M	MAX	Get it done.
M	MAX (CONT'D)	How much do you weigh? Seriously.
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	I do not think you are funny.
M	MAX	Where the hell is my bomb?
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	You do not get it till I get the money.
M	MAX	For a guy who's all about transcending materialism, you talk about money so much!
M	SHORT SCIENTIST	If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will cut your mouth out of your face.
M	MAX	Fine...
M	POOCH	She burned us, Clay. CLAY I know...
M	POOCH	The whole op is compromised-
M	CLAY	I know.
M	JENSEN	Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood flowing out of his body... Precious, precious blood...
M	CLAY	Cougar? Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN
M	JENSEN	What's that for?
M	POOCH	So we split up again. Right? Right?
M	ROQUE	Pooch...
M	POOCH	Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows, Max knows! It's over!
M	CLAY	Okay. We split up. Some of us should go international. I'll do that if nobody else wants to-
M	ROQUE	So we just run again?
M	CLAY	There's nothing else we can do...
M	ROQUE	There's something we can do. CLAY Excuse me?
M	ROQUE	Three years is enough. If there's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear-
M	CLAY	What part of "he knows we're coming for it" do you not get? They're gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec is gonna waiting for us...
M	ROQUE	So figure out a way around them; you're good at that shit, Clay!
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	We run now, we're gonna be running forever. This is our one chance to get our lives back... To steal them back. And I'm prepared to do anything to any one to make that happen. Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win.
M	CLAY	Pooch, what's the minimum time to scout the patrols, get an accurate head count on-site at the Port?
M	POOCH	48 hours, but Aisha knows that-
M	CLAY	So we hit them in twelve. Twelve hours from now? You mean-- you want us to go in blind?
M	ROQUE	Last thing they'll expect...
M	POOCH	Yeah, cause it's dumb.
M	CLAY	Jensen's already got the layout, and Cougar can spot on site. Right?
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Jensen?
M	JENSEN	Yeah, cause gettin' shot is awesome, I'm totally up for doing it again...
M	CLAY	Pooch?
M	POOCH	Last time we went in blind on an op, we lost everything...
M	CLAY	So?
M	POOCH	So let's go get it back.
M	CLAY	You ready?
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Roque?
M	ROQUE	I'm ready.
M	CLAY	We're in. Status.
M	POOCH	The Pooch is good.
M	CLAY (O.S.)	Cougar, squelch if you're in position.
M	COUGAR	Squelch.
M	CLAY	Jensen, we're coming. You ready?
M	JENSEN	And the crowd goes wild...
M	JENSEN	What's the password? Open the door before we kill you.
M	JENSEN	Drive should be in the Computer Room, two skylights over.
M	CLAY	Roque and I will set the charges here but we won't detonate until you have the drive.
M	ROQUE	You can't settle for stealing the drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's shit too.
M	CLAY	What can I say, I hold a grudge. Get gone. Be ready to move the second Cougar hits the fire alarm...
M	POOCH (O.S.)	Guys, we got a problem...
M	POOCH	Wade's here.
M	CLAY	Are you kidding me?
M	POOCH (O.S.)	No. I say we roll. Jensen, by a MIRRORED SKYLIGHT (so you can't see down
M	JENSEN	I'm above the computer room, maybe thirty seconds from the drive...
M	POOCH (O.S.)	Wade's headed your way - last chance to get the duck out of Fodge...
M	CLAY	Something's not right. Something...
M	ROQUE (O.S.)	Clay.
M	CLAY	What?
M	ROQUE	I think you should see this. Roque's got the doors of the container opened that he's
M	CLAY	You think... Aisha?
M	ROQUE	No. Not Aisha.
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	You know, for a revenge driven conspiracy nut, you're pretty fucking gullible...
M	POOCH	Jensen, you get it? Jensen?
M	WADE	Hello, Clay. Been awhile. Roque.
M	CLAY	When...?
M	ROQUE	After the truck. I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up, I go free.
M	CLAY	Traitor...
M	ROQUE	You gave me no choice. It was always gonna end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You made sure of it.
M	CLAY	Bullshit...
M	ROQUE	Not bullshit. You were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed.
M	CLAY	No...
M	ROQUE	Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away.
M	CLAY	We all could have walked... used the drive...
M	ROQUE	Don't you get it yet? There is no drive. There never was...
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	Fennel made it up to save himself. When I told Wade, he planted the info at Goliath to lead you here.
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	You really thought there was a happy ending coming? Pooch was gonna get his family back, we were gonna get to be soldiers again? We lost the moment we went off mission. This is just the logical conclusion of that playing out. You didn't want to hear it. You just wanted your revenge. Your face-to-face with the big bad wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's the way of the world...
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	Guys like us don't beat guys like him. Kill me now... Maybe you live through this.
M	WADE	Oh, we're not gonna kill you. Someone's gotta get away with the cash. Your crew? I'm definitely wasting them. But you?
M	WADE (CONT'D)	You're about to steal a billion dollars from the Central Intelligence Agency. It's for our replacement nuke. When a billion goes missing, people tend to ask who took it. Max really does love to frame you...
M	WADE (CONT'D)	Take him away. Drop him in Newark. I'll see you at Turner Airfield.
M	ROQUE	Wait.
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry it had to end this way.
M	CLAY	You're going to die very badly. The guards hustle Clay out the door...
M	CLAY	Roque.
M	Gone.	The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
M	LEAD GUARD	On your knees.
M	POOCH	Get on with it...
M	LEAD GUARD	That's a nice hat.
M	LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)	Don't really care of there's a hole in it. One wash, good as... What are you smiling at? KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...
M	JENSEN	Shouldn't have gone after the hat...
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	Can you stand?
M	POOCH	I've been shot in both legs, what kind of dumbass question is that?
M	JENSEN	Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're not the only one who's been shot recently, you know!
F	AISHA	Did you kill my father? Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
M	JENSEN	Clay?
M	CLAY	Kind of in the middle of something here, Jensen-
F	AISHA	Did you kill him?
M	JENSEN	There was no drive, Clay-
M	CLAY	I KNOW-
M	JENSEN	There was no drive and Roque's gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and Pooch could bleed out-
F	AISHA	Did you kill him? I did. He asked us. It was mercy. But you're his family, so I understand.
M	COUGAR (CONT'D)	But only me.
F	AISHA	Wear it. Remember him.
M	JENSEN	Okay, excellent, very tribal--We need to go.
M	CLAY	Can you stand?
M	POOCH	This is stupid question day, isn't it? It's stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me...
M	CLAY	Let's go.
M	CLAY	They won. We lost. Way it goes.
M	POOCH	Way it always goes. Guess we should just head home. Oh, wait, that's right. We don't have homes.
M	COUGAR	Where to, Colonel?
M	WADE	Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should we be worried?
M	ROQUE	Clay doesn't take risks. It's why I'm here and he's not.
M	WADE	You're sure?
M	WADE (CONT'D)	Can I ask you something? Why'd you stick with those losers for so long?
M	ROQUE	They were good guys.
M	WADE	No such thing. I'll go call Max.
M	CLAY	Hi, Wade!
M	ROQUE	Declan, start the plane...
M	POOCH	Next time, remind me - car crash first, then get shot...
M	JENSEN	Sounds less painful that way...
M	CLAY	Cougar and I are going after that plane. The rest of you, get Wade.
M	JENSEN	Me and legless Pooch are on it! Where the hell is she going? Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar
M	POOCH	You call me legless Pooch again, you're gonna be Headless Jensen.
M	JENSEN	What, it's a cool name! It makes you sound like a pirate! Fine, let's go kill Wade...
M	ON THE RUNWAY	
M	PILOT	We don't have enough runway to take off - we're going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed!
M	ROQUE	Fine, just get us in the air! He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette!
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	I'm out!
M	CLAY	I'm out.
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Get me closer... Jensen enters, carrying a MACHINE GUN.
M	JENSEN	Yoo-hoo! Wade! Come out and plaaaayyy-
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	Hey, Wade's coming at you! I...
M	JENSEN (CONT'D)	I think I just found our way out of here...
M	ROQUE	Gotta admit, I always wondered how this would play out.
M	CLAY	Aisha thinks you kill me.
M	ROQUE	It's a distinct possibility...
M	ROQUE (CONT'D)	You don't have a knife?
M	CLAY	Don't need one.
M	ROQUE	Bit of as longshot for you...
M	CLAY	No. It's not.
M	ROQUE	Now I really am gonna cut your head off...
M	CLAY	SHIT-
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Rifle...
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Outstanding.
M	JENSEN	Not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar. It's a cool name-
M	CLAY	Hello?
M	MAX	We good?
M	CLAY	Not by a longshot. You're not having a real great day, Max.
M	MAX	Who is this?
M	CLAY	Just a voice on the phone.
M	MAX	Where's Wade?
M	CLAY	Working on the engines.
M	MAX	Clay.
M	CLAY	It's Colonel.
M	MAX	Colonel, yes. Well done.
M	CLAY	Thank you.
M	MAX	I understand you've always wanted to meet face to face. I'm sure that could be arranged...
M	CLAY	I don't think the guys you're about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen. We win. You lose. Goodbye.
M	CLAY (CONT'D)	Lear jet? POOCH Ready when you are.
F	AISHA	I wanted to find and punish those responsible for my father's death. Max, his men, everyone.
M	CLAY	That why you slept with me?
F	AISHA	That and the cardio.
M	CLAY	You coming?
F	AISHA	I'm coming.
M	CLAY	Good cause there's no way I could walk it... She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they
M	SHORT SCIENTEST	Time is up, Stretch.
M	MAX	Stretch. That's a good one.
M	SHORT SCIENTEST	Because you are so much taller than I.
M	MAX	Yeah, no, I get it...
M	MAX (CONT'D)	You gentlemen consider yourselves to be soldiers or businessmen? FADE OUT
