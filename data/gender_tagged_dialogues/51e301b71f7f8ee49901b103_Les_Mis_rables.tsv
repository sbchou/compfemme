M	William Nicholson	Alain Boublil, Claude- Michel Schönberg and Herbert Kretzmer "Les Misérables"
M	Based on the novel by	Victor Hugo BLACK SCREEN
M	The French revolution is a distant	memory. Napoleon has been defeated. France is ruled by a King again.
M	Toulon	Home port of the French navy
M	CONVICTS	Ha - Ha -
M	CONVICT 3	Ha - Ha - Look down, look down Don't look them in the eye
M	CONVICTS	You're here until you die.
M	CONVICT 4	No God above And Hell alone below
M	CONVICTS	There's twenty years to go.
M	CONVICT 2	I've done no wrong Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!
M	CONVICTS	Look down, look down Sweet Jesus doesn't care.
M	CONVICT 5	I know she'll wait I know that she'll be true -
M	CONVICTS	Look down, look down They've all forgotten you.
M	CONVICT 1	When I get free You won't see me Here for dust!
M	CONVICTS	Look down, look down Don't look'em in the eye.
M	CONVICT 3	How long, O Lord Before you let me die?
M	CONVICTS	Look down, look down You'll always be a slave. Look down, look down You're standing in your grave.
M	JAVERT	Now Prisoner 24601. Your time is up And your parole's begun. You know what that means?
M	VALJEAN	Yes. It means I'm free.
M	JAVERT	No! It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave.
M	JAVERT	This badge of shame You'll show it everywhere. It warns you're a dangerous man.
M	VALJEAN	I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving.
M	JAVERT	You will starve again Unless you learn the meaning of the law.
M	VALJEAN	I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law!
M	JAVERT	Five years for what you did, The rest because you tried to run. Yes, 24601!
M	VALJEAN	My name is Jean Valjean!
M	JAVERT	And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name. Do not forget me -
M	CONVICTS	Look down, look down You'll always be a slave. Look down, look down You're standing in your grave.
M	VALJEAN	Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins And now lets see What this new world Will do for me!
M	VALJEAN	Monsieur can I help? A day's work?
M	OVERSEER	Take your hat off.
M	OVERSEER	Passport.
M	OVERSEER	No work here.
M	OFFICER	Valjean.
M	INNKEEPER	My inn is full.
M	VALJEAN	Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight?
M	JAILER	This is a prison, not an inn. Get yourself arrested. Then we will open up for you.
M	BISHOP	Come in, sir, for you are weary And the night is cold out here. Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share.
M	BISHOP	There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from wrong.
M	BISHOP	Sit, my brother.
M	BISHOP	Madame, set one more place. Please sit.
M	BISHOP	May the Lord bless the food we eat today. Bless our dear sister and our honoured guest. Please, eat. Where are you travelling to my brother?
M	VALJEAN	Pontarlier.
M	BISHOP	Is that where your family is?
M	VALJEAN	No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home.
M	BISHOP	as long as you need it.
M	BISHOP	Sleep well. Tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot.
M	VALJEAN	You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer?
M	BISHOP	God will take care of that. Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last
M	CONSTABLE	Monsignor, we caught the thief red-handed! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this!
M	BISHOP	That is right.
M	BISHOP	But my friend, you left so early, You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind?
M	BISHOP	Messieurs, release him. For this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty Now God's blessing go with you.
M	BISHOP	But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, By the passion and the blood, God has raised you out of darkness - I have bought your soul for God.
M	VALJEAN	What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me!
M	Take an eye for an eye!	Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?
M	VALJEAN	I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin.
M	VALJEAN	I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now!
M	VALJEAN	Another story must begin! SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle! It's a war! And there's nothing that anyone's giving. One more day standing about - What is it for? One day less to be living. At the end of the day you're another day colder And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill - One day nearer to dying! At the end of the day there's another day dawning And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any second There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day!
M	FOREMAN	At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing! Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread!
M	FACTORY WOMAN 4	There are children back at home -
M	FACTORY WOMAN 2	And the children have got to be fed. And you're lucky to be in a job -
M	FOREMAN	And in a bed!
M	FACTORY WOMAN 8	And we're counting our blessings!
M	FOREMAN	At the end of the day just be glad to be working For a master who cares for the lives of the poor.
M	FACTORY WOMAN 7	He's a riddle..
M	FACTORY WOMAN 4	He's no fool..
M	FACTORY WOMAN 6	He's the answer to anyone's prayer
M	FACTORY WOMAN 8	And he paid for the brand new school
M	FACTORY WOMAN 4	It's no wonder they made him the mayor!
M	FACTORY WOMEN	Bless the man who leads the way! At the end of the day!
M	MAIN FACTORY WOMAN	Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today With his terrible breath and his wandering hands? It's because little Fantine won't give him his way.
M	FACTORY WOMAN 5	Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!
M	FACTORY WOMAN 2	And the boss, he never knows That the foreman is always on heat.
M	MAIN FACTORY WOMAN	If Fantine doesn't look out, Watch how she goes, She'll be out on the street!
M	FACTORY WOMEN/FOREMAN	At the end of the day its another day over With enough in your pocket to last for a week Pay the landlord, pay the shop Keep on working as long as you're able Keep on working till you drop Or it's back to the crumbs off the table Well, you've got to pay your way At the end of the day!
M	MAIN FACTORY WOMAN	And what have we here, little innocent sister?
M	MAIN FACTORY WOMAN	Come on, Fantine, let's have all the news. `Dear Fantine, you must send us more money, Your child needs a doctor, There's no time to lose.'
F	FANTINE	Give that letter to me It is none of your business. With a husband at home And a bit on the side! Is there anyone here Who can swear before God She has nothing to fear? She has nothing to hide?
M	VALJEAN	What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus.
M	VALJEAN	Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute.
M	VALJEAN	Deal with this, Foreman. Be as patient as you can.
M	FOREMAN	Now someone say how this began!
M	FANTINE/FACTORY WOMAN 5	At the end of the day she's the one who began it!
M	MAIN FACTORY WOMAN	There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town.
M	FACTORY WOMAN 5	There's a man she has to pay You can guess how she picks up the extra - You can bet she's earning her keep Sleeping around! And the boss wouldn't like it.
F	FANTINE	Yes, it's true there's a child And the child is my daughter And her father abandoned us, Leaving us flat. Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife And I pay for the child. What's the matter with that?
M	FACTORY WOMEN	At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble there's trouble for one! While we're earning our daily bread She's the one with her hands in the butter - You must send the slut away Or we're all going to end in the gutter And it's us who'll have to pay At the end of the day!
M	FOREMAN	I might have known the bitch could bite! I might have known the cat had claws! I might have guessed your little secret! Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine Who keeps herself so pure and clean - You'd be the cause, I had no doubt Of any trouble hereabout. You play a virgin in the light But need no urging in the night!
M	MAIN FACTORY WOMAN	She's been laughing at you While she's having her men!
M	FACTORY WOMEN	She'll be nothing but trouble again and again!
M	FACTORY WOMAN 5	You must sack her today!
M	FACTORY WOMEN	Sack the girl today!
M	FOREMAN	Right, my girl! On your way!
F	FANTINE	M'sieur Mayor, help me! I have a child!

M	VALJEAN	Get back! It may fall!
M	FOREMAN	No, Monsieur le Mayor!
M	CROWD	It'll kill you as well!
M	JAVERT	Can this be true? I don't believe what I see! A man your age To be as strong as you are! A memory stirs... You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared.
M	JAVERT	Forgive me, sir. I would not dare -

F	FANTINE	There was a time when men were kind, When their voices were soft And their words inviting. There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting. There was a time... Then it all went wrong.
M	I dreamed a dream in time gone	by, When hope was high And life worth living. I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. And dreams were made and used and wasted. There was no ransom to be paid, No song unsung, no wine untasted.
M	But the tigers come at night	With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart As they turn your dream to shame. He filled my days with endless wonder. He took my childhood in his stride But he was gone when autumn came. me! That we will live the years together... But there are dreams that cannot be And there are storms we cannot weather... So different from this hell I'm living - So different now from what it seemed! Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.

F	FANTINE	I don't want you! No! No, M'sieur! Let me go!
M	BAMATABOIS	Is this a trick? I won't pay more!
F	FANTINE	No, not at all!
M	BAMATABOIS	You've got some nerve, you little slut! You've got some gall! It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer The customer sees what he gets in advance It's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir" It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose or to lead me a dance!
F	FANTINE	I'll kill you, you bastard! Try any of that! Even a whore who has gone to the bad Won't be had by a rat!
M	BAMATABOIS	By Christ you'll pay for what you've done! This rat will make you bleed, you'll see! I guarantee I'll make you suffer! For this disturbance of the peace For this insult to life and property!

M	JAVERT	Tell me quickly what's the story. Who saw what and why and where? Let him give a full description, Let him answer to Javert! In this nest of whores and vipers Let one speak who saw it all. Who laid hands on this good man here? What's the substance of this brawl?
M	BAMATABOIS	Javert, would you believe it? I was walking, it was dark When this prostitute attacked me You can see she's left her mark!
M	JAVERT	She will answer for her actions When you make a full report. You may rest assured, M'sieur, That she will answer to the court.
F	FANTINE	me, Please, m'sieur, she's but that high. Holy God, is there no mercy? If I go to jail she'll die.
M	JAVERT	I have heard such protestations Every day for twenty years. Let's have no more explanations, Save your breath and save your tears.
M	VALJEAN	A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale.
M	JAVERT	Monsieur le Mayor!
M	VALJEAN	You've done your duty. Let her be. She needs a doctor, not a jail.
M	JAVERT	Monsieur le Mayor!
F	FANTINE	Can this be?
M	VALJEAN	Where will she end - This child without a friend?
M	VALJEAN	I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grief In such a place as this?
F	FANTINE	M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray It's hard enough I've lost my pride. You let your foreman send me away. Yes, you were there And turned aside. I never did no wrong.
M	VALJEAN	Is it true what I've done -
F	FANTINE	My daughter's close to dying.
M	VALJEAN	- to an innocent soul?
F	FANTINE	If there's a God above -
M	VALJEAN	Had I only known then!
F	FANTINE	He'd let me die instead.
M	VALJEAN	In His name my task has just begun. I will her to the hospital.
M	JAVERT	Monsieur le Mayor!
F	FANTINE	Bring Cosette back to me.
M	VALJEAN	Where is she?
F	FANTINE	At an inn in Montfermeil...
M	JAVERT	Monsieur le Mayor!
M	VALJEAN	I will see it done! I will send for her immediately!
M	JAVERT'S ASSISTANT	From Paris, Monsieur.
M	JAVERT	Monsieur le Mayor I have a crime to declare! I have disgraced The uniform that I wear. I've done you wrong, Let no forgiveness be shown. I've been as hard On every rogue I have known. I'll bear the blame, I must be treated Just the same.
M	VALJEAN	I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert?
M	JAVERT	I mistook you for a convict, I have made a false report. Now I learn they've caught the culprit - He's about to face the court.
M	JAVERT	And of course the thief denies it, You'd expect that from a con. But he couldn't run for ever, No, not even Jean Valjean.
M	VALJEAN	You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to trial, And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence?
M	JAVERT	He will pay, and so must I. Press charges against me, sir!
M	VALJEAN	You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post.
M	JAVERT	Must I do as you say?
M	VALJEAN	It's your duty to obey!
M	VALJEAN	They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance! Why should I right this wrong? When I have come so far And struggled for so long? If I stay silent, I am damned!
M	VALJEAN	I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free? If I stay silent, I am damned! Can I condemn this man to slavery? Pretend I do not feel his agony? This innocent who bears my face, Who goes to judgement in my place... Who am I?
M	VALJEAN	Can I conceal myself for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi? How can I ever face my fellow men? How can I ever face myself again?
M	VALJEAN	My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was gone! He gave me strength to journey on! Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean!
M	VALJEAN	And so, your honour, you see it's true That man bears no more guilt than you! Who am I? The judge is too stunned to respond. The others in the
M	VALJEAN	If you don't believe me ask Inspector Javert. He knows where to find me.
M	JUDGE	Monsieur le Mayor, you are not well, you must come with me, do you have a carriage outside? Monsieur le Mayor, we must get you home to bed immediately!!
M	VALJEAN	Is her daughter with her?
M	NURSE	No, monsieur. Her guardian sent this.
M	VALJEAN	`Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is this?
F	FANTINE	Cosette, it's turned so cold! Cosette, it's past your bedtime! You've played the day away And soon it will be night. fading. Don't you see, the evening star appearing? Come to me, and rest against my shoulder, How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder?
M	VALJEAN	Dear Fantine, Cosette will be here soon! Dear Fantine, she will be by your side
F	FANTINE	Come Cosette, the night has grown so cold!
M	VALJEAN	Be at peace! Be at peace ever more.
F	FANTINE	My Cosette -
M	VALJEAN	- shall live in my protection.
F	FANTINE	Take her now!
M	VALJEAN	Your child will want for nothing.
F	FANTINE	Good m'sieur, you come from God in heaven.
M	VALJEAN	And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living.
F	FANTINE	Take my hand... The night grows ever colder.
M	VALJEAN	Then I will keep you warm.
F	FANTINE	Take my child I give her to your keeping.
M	VALJEAN	Take shelter from the storm.
F	FANTINE	For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping... And tell Cosette I love her And I'll see her when I wake...
M	JAVERT	Valjean, at last We see each other plain! `M'sieur le Mayor' You'll wear a different chain!
M	VALJEAN	Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my word! Then I'll return...
M	JAVERT	You must think me mad! I've hunted you across the years. Men like you can never change - A man such as you! men start to circle each other.
M	VALJEAN	Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done!
M	JAVERT	Men like me can never change. Men like you can never change. No, 24601! You have no rights. Come with me, 24601!
M	VALJEAN	I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run!
M	JAVERT	Now the wheel has turned around - Jean Valjean is nothing now. Dare you talk to me of crime And the price you had to pay. Every man is born in sin Every man must choose his way.
M	You know nothing of Javert!	I was born inside a jail. I was born with scum like you. I am from the gutter too. Javert stares into the black sea - there is no sign of
M	VALJEAN	And this I swear to you tonight - There is no place for you to hide.
M	VALJEAN	Your child will live within my care -
M	JAVERT	Wherever you may hide away -
M	VALJEAN	And I will raise her to the light.
M	JAVERT/VALJEAN	I swear to you, I will be there!
F	COSETTE	There is a castle on a cloud I like to go there in my sleep. Aren't any floors for me to sweep, Not in my castle on a cloud.
M	There is a lady all in white	Holds me and sings a lullaby. She's nice to see and she's soft to touch She says, Cosette, I love you very much. lost I know a place where no one cries. Crying at all is not allowed, Not in my castle on a cloud.
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Now look who's here! The little madam herself, Pretending once again She's been so awfully good! Better not let me catch you slacking! Better not catch my eye! Ten rotten francs your mother sends me - What is that going to buy? Now take that pail, My little Mademoiselle, And go and draw some water from the well. We should never have taken you in In the first place - How stupid the things that we do! Like mother, like daughter, the scum of the street.
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Eponine, come my dear. Eponine, let me see you. You look very well in that little blue hat! There's some little girls who know how to behave And they know what to wear And I'm saying thank heaven for that!
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Still there, Cosette? Your tears will do you no good! I told you to fetch some water from the well in the wood.
F	COSETTE	Please do not send me out alone. Not in the darkness on my own.
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Enough of that, or I'll forget to be nice! You heard me ask for something, And I never ask twice!
M	CUSTOMER 1	Mine host Thenardier He was there, so they say, At the field of Waterloo.
M	CUSTOMER 2	Got there, it's true, When the fight was all through But he knew just what to do.
M	CUSTOMER 3	Crawling through the mud, So I've heard it said, Picking through the pockets of the English dead.
M	CUSTOMER 4	He made a tidy score from the spoils of war.
M	THENARDIER	My band of soaks, My den of dissolutes, My dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts, My sons of whores, Spend their lives in my inn! Homing pigeons homing in - They fly through my doors, And their money's as good as yours!
M	THENARDIER	Welcome, m'sieur! Sit yourself down And meet the best Innkeeper in town!
M	THENARDIER	As for the rest - All of them crooks Rooking the guests And cooking the books. Seldom do you see Honest men like me A gent of good intent Who's content to be -
M	THENARDIER	Master of the house! Doling out the charm Ready with a handshake And an open palm
M	THENARDIER	Tells a saucy tale Makes a little stir Customers appreciate a bon-viveur Glad to do a friend a favour Doesn't cost me to be nice But nothing gets you nothing Everything has got a little price!

M	VALJEAN	Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry. Show me where you live. Tell me, my child, what is your name?
F	COSETTE	I'm called Cosette.
M	VALJEAN	Cosette?
M	VALJEAN	I found her wandering in the wood This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. And I am here to help Cosette, And I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay To take Cosette away. There is a promise I have made. For I was blind to one in need, I did not see what stood before me. Now your mother is with God. Her suffering is over, And I speak here with her voice, And I stand here in her place, and from this day, and ever more -
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Let me take your coat, m'sieur!
M	VALJEAN	Cosette shall live in my protection.
M	THENARDIER	You are very welcome here!
M	VALJEAN	I will not forget my vow.
M	THENARDIER	Take a glass!
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Take a chair!
M	VALJEAN	Cosette shall have a father now.
M	THENARDIER	What to do? What to say Shall you carry our treasure away? What a gem! What a pearl! Beyond rubies is our little girl! How can we speak of debt? Let's not haggle for darling Colette!
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Cosette!
M	THENARDIER	Cosette - Dear Fantine - gone to rest - Have we done for her child what is best? Shared our bread - shared each bone - Treated her like she's one of our own! Like our own, m'sieur!
M	VALJEAN	Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed.
M	VALJEAN	Now may I say we are agreed?
M	MADAME THENARDIER	That would quite fit the bill If she hadn't so often been ill. Little dear, cost us dear! Medicines are expensive, m'sieur. Not that we begrudged a sou - It's no more than we Christians must do.
M	THENARDIERS	One thing more! One small doubt! There are treacherous people about! No offence! Please reflect! Your intentions may not be correct!
M	VALJEAN	No more! Here's your price! Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette, say goodbye. Let's seek out some friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette - It won't take you too long to forget.
M	VALJEAN	Where I go, you will be.
F	COSETTE	Will you be like a Papa to me?
M	VALJEAN	Yes, Cosette! This is true! I'll be father and mother to you!
M	THENARDIER	Not bad!
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Not enough!
M	MADAME THENARDIER	There's a copper at the door! What the devil have you done?
M	JAVERT	Where's the child Cosette?
M	MADAME THENARDIER	She's gone with a gent, Didn't tell us where they went, Didn't leave his home address.
M	JAVERT	Did you catch the fellow's name?
M	MADAME THENARDIER	You're a bloody fool Look at what we got.
M	THENARDIER	Should have struck the iron, Struck it while it's hot.
M	THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER	Next time round we'll be here And we're gonna get the lot.
M	VALJEAN	Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one. Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclear Something not yet here Has begun. Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace And delight. That so much love Was held inside me? Something fresh and young Something still unsung Fills the night.
M	How was I to know at last	That happiness can come so fast? Trusting me the way you do I'm so afraid of failing you Just a child who cannot know That danger follows where I go There are shadows everywhere And memories I cannot share
M	Nevermore alone	Nevermore apart You have warmed my heart Like the sun. You have brought the gift of life And love so long denied me.
M	Suddenly I see	What I could not see Something suddenly Has begun.
M	NUNS	Te lucis ante terminum Rerum Creator poscimus Ut pro tua clementia Sis praesul et custodia...
M	NUNS	Procul recedant somnia Et noctium phantasmata Hostemque nostrum comprime Ne polluantur corpora...
M	FAUCHELEVENT	Who's that?
M	FAUCHELEVENT	Why, it's Monsieur Mayor!
M	VALJEAN	Who are you?
M	FAUCHELEVENT	Don't you remember? The cart fell on me!
M	VALJEAN	Monsieur Fauchelevent!
M	FAUCHELEVENT	You saved my life! You got me this job as a gardener!
M	VALJEAN	Now you can do the same for me. We need a place of sanctuary. This child and I, we need to disappear.
M	FAUCHELEVENT	In this place of Holy Orders You are brought to God's domain May the sisters grant you shelter May their prayers ease your pain.
M	VALJEAN	We'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again.
M	BEGGARS CHORUS	Look down and see the beggars at your feet! Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down and see the sweepings of the street! Look down, look down, Upon your fellow man!
M	GAVROCHE	`Ow do you do? My name's Gavroche! These are my people, here's my patch. Not much to look at - nothing posh! Nothing that you'd call up to scratch. This is my school, my high society! Here in the slums of St Michel. We live on crumbs of humble piety Tough on the teeth - but what the hell! Think you're poor? Think you're free? Follow me! Follow me!
M	BEGGARS CHORUS	Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down, look down, upon your fellow man!
M	GAVROCHE	There was a time we killed the King We tried to change the world too fast. Now we have got another King, He is no better than the last. This is the land that fought for liberty - Now when we fight we fight for bread! Here is the thing about equality - Everyone's equal when they're dead. Take your place! Take your chance! Vive la France! Vive la France!
M	STUDENTS/BEGGARS CHORUS	Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down, look down, upon your fellow man!
M	COURFEYRAC	
M	BEGGAR 1	When we gonna live?
M	JOLY	Something's gotta happen now!
M	BEGGAR 2	Something's gotta give!
M	STUDENTS AND BEGGARS	It'll come, it'll come, it'll come... It'll come, it'll come, it'll come...
M	ENJOLRAS	Where are the leaders of the land? Where are the swells who run this show?
M	MARIUS	Only one man, General Lamarque Speaks for the people here below!
M	ENJOLRAS	Lamarque is ill and fading fast - Won't last a week out, so they say.
M	MARIUS	With all the anger in the land, How long before the Judgement Day?
M	ENJOLRAS	Before we cut the fat ones down to size?
M	STUDENTS	Before the barricades arise?
M	POLICE	Look down, look down, don't look us in the eye! Look down, look down, stay here and you die!
M	ENJOLRAS	Tomorrow we will return!
M	MARIUS	Tell everyone you know
M	COURFEYRAC	We will show them!
M	COMBEFERRE	Lamarque is the only leader on our side!
M	COURFEYRAC	We have a right to pray for Lamarque!
M	JOLY	We need more people, then the police will not dare ride against us!
M	MARIUS	Vive le General Lamarque!
M	GILLENORMAND	Do you have any idea of the shame you bring on your family! You're behaving like a child.
M	EPONINE	Hey there Monsieur what's new with you? Haven't seen much of you of late. Planning no doubt to change the world? Plotting to overthrow the state? Still living here in this old sewer Might as well doss down in a ditch You still pretending to be poor Everyone knows your Grandpa's rich
M	MARIUS	How did you...?
M	EPONINE	There's lots of things I know
M	MARIUS	Won't take a franc that I've not earned All of those bridges have been burned.
M	EPONINE	I like the way you talk Monsieur!
M	MARIUS	I like the way you always tease.
M	EPONINE	Little he knows - Little he sees.
M	THENARDIER	Everyone here, you know your place - Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous - You, Montparnasse, watch for the law - With Eponine - take care. Eponine was watching You turn on the tears! No mistakes, my dears!
M	THENARDIER	Please, M'sieur, come this way. Here's a child that ain't eaten today. Save a life, spare a sou! God rewards all the good that you do.
M	MADAME THENARDIER	Wait a bit! Know that face! Ain't the world a remarkable place!
M	THENARDIER	Men like me don't forget - You're the bastard who borrowed Cosette!
M	VALJEAN	What is this? Are you mad? No, Monsieur, you don't know what you say!
M	THENARDIER	You know me! I know you! And you'll pay what I'm due.
M	EPONINE	It's the police! Disappear! Run for it! It's Javert!
M	JAVERT	Another brawl in the square! Another stink in the air! Was there a witness to this? Well, let him speak to Javert!
M	JAVERT	Monsieur, these streets are not safe. But let these vermin beware, We'll see that justice is done!
M	JAVERT	Look upon this fine collection Crawled from underneath a stone. This swarm of worms and maggots Could have picked you to the bone! I know this man over here, I know his name and his trade. And on your witness, m'sieur, I'll see him suitably paid.
M	JAVERT	But where's the gentlemen gone? And why on earth did he run?
M	THENARDIER	You will have a job to find him! He's not all he seems to be - And that girl he trails behind him She's the child he stole from me!
M	JAVERT	Could it be he's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in? Heard my name and started running... All the omens point to him.
M	JAVERT	And the girl who stood beside him, When I turned they both had gone. Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean?
M	THENARDIER	In the absence of a victim, Dear Inspector, may I go? And remember when you've nicked him It was me what told you so.
M	JAVERT	Let the old man keep on running I will run him off his feet! Everyone about your business! Clear this garbage off the street!
M	GAVROCHE	That inspector thinks he's something But it's me who runs this town! And my theatre never closes And the curtain's never down! Trust Gavroche! Have no fear! You can always find me here!
M	EPONINE	Cosette! Now I remember... Cosette! How can it be? We were children together. Look what's become of me.
M	MARIUS	Eponine! Who was that girl?
M	EPONINE	That bourgeois two-a-penny thing!
M	MARIUS	Eponine, find her for me!
M	EPONINE	What will you give me?
M	MARIUS	Anything!
M	EPONINE	Got you all excited now, But God knows what you see in her. Aren't you all delighted now? No, I don't want your money, sir.
M	MARIUS	Eponine, do this for me, Discover where she lives. But careful how you go - Don't let your father know. Eponine! I'm lost until she's found.
M	EPONINE	You see? I told you so! There's lots of things I know! Eponine, she knows her way around.
M	JAVERT	There, out in the darkness A fugitive running Running from God Fallen from grace - God be my witness I never shall yield Till we come face to face - Till we come face to face... Mine is the way of the Lord Those who follow the path of the righteous Shall have their reward And if they fall As Lucifer fell - The flame!
M	The sword!	Stars in your multitudes! Scarce to be counted Filling the darkness With order and light - You are the sentinels Silent and sure Keeping watch in the night - Keeping watch in the night... You hold your course And your aim And each in your season Returns and returns And is always the same And if you fall As Lucifer fell You fall In flame! written On the doorway to paradise That those who falter And those who fall Must pay the price!
M	Lord, let me find him	That I may see him Safe behind bars! I will never rest till then! This I swear This I swear by the stars!
M	ENJOLRAS	Well, Courfeyrac! Do we have all the guns? Joly, Prouvaire! Our time is running short!
M	COURFEYRAC	Students, workers, everyone! There's a river on the run! Like the flowing of the tide, Paris is coming to our side!
M	COMBEFERRE	Enjolras! At Notre Dame The sections are prepared! At Rue du Bac They're straining at the leash!
M	ENJOLRAS	Grantaire, put the bottle down! Did we get the guns we need?
M	GRANTAIRE	Give me brandy on my breath And I'll breathe them all to death!
M	ENJOLRAS	The time is near... So near it's stirring the blood in their veins. And yet beware! Don't let the wine go to your brains. For the army we fight is a dangerous foe With the men and the arms that we never can match. It is easy to sit here and swat them like flies But the National Guard will be harder to catch. We need a sign To rally the people To call them to arms To bring them in line!
M	JOLY	Marius, wake up! What's wrong today? You look as if you've seen a ghost.
M	GRANTAIRE	Some wine, and say what's going on!
M	MARIUS	A ghost, you say? A ghost maybe! She was like a ghost to me - One minute there - then she was gone!
M	GRANTAIRE	I am agog! I am aghast! Is Marius in love at last? I've never heard him Ooh and Aah. You talk of battles to be won And here he comes like Don Juan! It is better than an opera!
M	ENJOLRAS	It is time for us all To decide who we are. Do we fight for the right To a night at the opera now? Have you asked yourselves What's the price you might pay? Is this simply a game For rich young boys to play? The colours of the world Are changing day by day - Black - the dark of ages past! Red - a world about to dawn! Black - the night that ends at last!
M	MARIUS	Had you seen her today You might know how it feels To be struck to the bone By a moment of breathless delight!
M	Had you been there today	You might also have known How the world may be changed In just one burst of light And what was right seems wrong And what was wrong seems right!
M	GRANTAIRE	Red!
M	MARIUS	I feel my soul on fire!
M	GRANTAIRE	Black!
M	MARIUS	My world if she's not there!
M	STUDENTS	Red!
M	MARIUS	The colour of desire!
M	STUDENTS	Black!
M	MARIUS	The colour of despair!
M	ENJOLRAS	Marius, you're no longer a child - I do not doubt you mean it well But now there is a higher call! Who cares about your lonely soul? We strive towards a larger goal - Our little lives don't count at all!
M	ENJOLRAS	Red!
M	STUDENTS	The blood of angry men!
M	ENJOLRAS	Black!
M	STUDENTS	The dark of ages past! Red - a world about to dawn! Black - the night that ends at last!
M	GAVROCHE	Listen! Listen to me!
M	COURFEYRAC	Listen, everybody!
M	GAVROCHE	General Lamarque is dead!
M	ENJOLRAS	Lamarque is dead... Lamarque... His death is the hour of fate. The people's man... His death is the sign we await! On his funeral day they will honour his name With the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes. From their candles of grief we will kindle our flame. On the tomb of Lamarque shall our barricades rise! Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer!
M	STUDENT	Let us take to the street with no doubt in our hearts
M	COURFEYRAC	But a jubilant shout!
M	LESGLES	They will come one and all!
M	STUDENTS	They will come when we call!
F	COSETTE	How strange - This feeling that my life's begun at last! This change - Can people really fall in love so fast? What's the matter with you, Cosette? Have you been too much on your own? So many things unclear - So many things unknown...
M	In my life	There are so many questions and answers That somehow seem wrong. In my life There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of a faraway song And it sings Of a world that I long to see - Out of reach Just a whisper away Waiting for me!
M	Does he know I'm alive?	Do I know if he's real? Does he see what I see? Does he feel what I feel?
M	In my life	I'm no longer alone - Now the love in my life Is so near... Find me now! Find me here!
M	VALJEAN	Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company.
F	COSETTE	There's so little I know That I'm longing to know Of the man that you were In a time long ago... There's so little you say Of the life you have known, Why you keep to yourself, Why we're always alone. So dark! So dark and deep, The secrets that you keep! In my life Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good. But papa, dear papa, In your eyes I am still like that child Who was lost in a wood.
M	VALJEAN	No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid.
F	COSETTE	In my life I'm no longer a child and I yearn For the truth that you know Of the years... Years ago!
M	VALJEAN	You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn.
M	MARIUS	In my life She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun! As if something is over And something has scarcely begun! Eponine, you're the friend Who has brought me here. Thanks to you I am one with the Gods And heaven is near! And I soar through a world that is new, That is free!
M	EPONINE	Every word that he says Is a dagger in me! In my life There's been no one like him anywhere, Anywhere, where he is If he asked... I'd be his!
M	MARIUS/EPONINE	In my life There is someone who touches my life -
M	MARIUS	Waiting near!
M	EPONINE	Waiting here!
M	MARIUS	A heart full of love!
M	MARIUS	A heart full of song! I'm doing everything all wrong - Oh God, for shame - I do not even know your name. Dear Mad'moiselle, Won't you say? Will you tell?
F	COSETTE	A heart full of love! No fear, no regret!
M	MARIUS	My name is Marius Pontmercy.
F	COSETTE	And mine's Cosette.
M	MARIUS	Cosette... I don't know what to say -
F	COSETTE	Then make no sound.
M	MARIUS	I am lost -
F	COSETTE	I am found!
M	MARIUS	A heart full of light - A night bright as day -
M	MARIUS	And you must never go away, Cosette - Cosette!
F	COSETTE	This is a chain we'll never break. Do I dream?
F	COSETTE	I'm awake.
M	MARIUS	A heart full of love -
M	EPONINE	He was never mine to lose Why regret What could not be?
F	COSETTE	A heart full of you -
M	EPONINE	These are words he'll never say Not to me, not to me Not for me!
M	MARIUS	A single look and then I knew!
F	COSETTE	I knew it too!
M	EPONINE	His heart full of love...
M	MARIUS	From today -
M	EPONINE	He will never feel this way.
F	COSETTE	Every day...
M	MARIUS/COSETTE	For it isn't a dream - Not a dream After all!
M	VALJEAN	Cosette! Cosette!
M	MONTPARNASSE	This is his lair! I've seen the old fox around.
M	BABET	He keeps himself to himself He's staying close to the ground.
M	THENARDIER	I smell profit here! Ten years ago He came and paid for Cosette. I let her go for a song. It's time we settled the debt. This'll cost him dear.
M	BRUJON	What do I care Who you should rob? Gimme my share! Finish the job!
M	THENARDIER	You shut your mouth! You'll get what's yours!
M	BRUJON	What have we here?
M	THENARDIER	Who is this hussy?
M	BABET	It's your brat Eponine! Don't you know your own kid? Why's she hanging about here?
M	THENARDIER	Eponine, get on home! You're not needed in this. We're enough here without you.
M	EPONINE	I know this house, I tell you! There's nothing here for you! Just the old man and the girl. They live ordinary lives.
M	THENARDIER	Don't interfere! You've got some gall! Take care, young miss, You've got a lot to say!
M	BRUJON	She's going soft!
M	CLACQUESOUS	Happens to all!
M	MONTPARNASSE	Go home, Eponine! Go home, you're in the way!
M	EPONINE	I'm gonna scream! I'm gonna warn them here!
M	THENARDIER	One little scream and you'll regret it for a year!
M	THENARDIER	Make for the sewers! Get underground! Leave her to me, Don't wait around!
M	THENARDIER	You wait, my girl! You'll rue this night! I'll make you scream! You'll scream all right!
M	VALJEAN	My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street.
F	COSETTE	Three men I saw beyond the wall... Three men in shadow moving fast!
M	VALJEAN	This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past!
M	VALJEAN	Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns.
M	VALJEAN	We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette!
F	COSETTE	To where?
M	VALJEAN	Rue de L'Homme Armee.
F	COSETTE	No! No!
M	VALJEAN	And then a ship across the sea.
M	VALJEAN	Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away!
F	COSETTE	No! Please no! We can't go!
M	VALJEAN	Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day!
F	COSETTE	Please give this to Marius! He must know where to find me.
M	EPONINE	And now I'm all alone again - Nowhere to turn, no one to go to. Without a home, without a friend, Without a face to say hello to. The city goes to bed And I can live inside my head.
M	On my own	Pretending he's beside me All alone I walk with him till morning Without him I feel his arms around me And when I lose my way I close my eyes And he has found me.
M	EPONINE	In the rain The pavement shines like silver All the lights Are misty in the river In the darkness the trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me forever and forever! That I'm talking to myself and not to him. And although I know that he is blind, Still I say there's a way for us. He is gone - the river's just a river. Without him the world around me changes - The trees are bare and everywhere The streets are full of strangers. But every day I'm learning All my life I've only been pretending. Without me, his world will go on turning A world that's full of happiness That I have never know. I love him I love him But only on my own. Her solitary journey has brought her to the Gorbeau slum.
M	EPONINE	I came to tell you she's gone.
M	MARIUS	Gone? What do you mean?
M	EPONINE	She's gone to England.
M	VALJEAN	One day more! Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more!
M	MARIUS	I did not live until today - How can I live when we are parted?
M	VALJEAN	One day more!
F	COSETTE	Tomorrow you'll be worlds away And yet with you my world has started!
M	EPONINE	One more day all on my own...
M	MARIUS/COSETTE	Will we ever meet again?
M	EPONINE	One more day with him not caring...
M	MARIUS/COSETTE	I was born to be with you!
M	EPONINE	What a life I might have known...
M	MARIUS/COSETTE	And I swear I will be true!
M	EPONINE	But he never saw me there.
M	ENJOLRAS	One more day before the storm!
M	MARIUS	Do I follow where she goes?
M	ENJOLRAS	At the barricades of freedom!
M	MARIUS	Shall I join my brothers there?
M	ENJOLRAS	Do I stay and do I dare?
M	ENJOLRAS	Will you take your place with me?
M	ALL	The time is now! The day is here! One day more!
M	JAVERT	One day more to revolution. We will nip it in the bud. We'll be ready for these schoolboys. They will wet themselves with blood!
M	VALJEAN	One day more!
M	THENARDIERS	Watch'em run amuck! Catch'em as they fall! Never know your luck When there's a free-for-all. Here a little dip, There a little touch - Most of them are goners So they won't miss much!
M	STUDENTS/CROWD	One day to a new beginning! Raise the flag of freedom high! Every man will be a king! Every man will be a king! There's a new world for the winning! There's a new world to be won! Do you hear the people sing?
M	MARIUS	My place is here! I fight with you!
M	VALJEAN	One day more!
M	COSETTE/MARIUS	I did not live until today How can I live when we are parted?
M	EPONINE	One more day on my own...
M	JAVERT	I will join these people's heroes I will follow where they go. I will learn their little secrets, I will know the things they know.
M	VALJEAN/JAVERT	One day more!
M	MARIUS/COSETTE	Tomorrow you'll be worlds away And yet with you my world has started.
M	JAVERT	One more day to revolution We will nip it in the bud We'll be ready for these schoolboys -
M	THENARDIERS	Watch'em run amuck Catch'em as they fall Never know your luck When there's a free-for-all!
M	VALJEAN	Tomorrow we'll be far away.
M	VALJEAN/JAVERT	Tomorrow is the judgement day.
M	ALL	Tomorrow we'll discover What our God in heaven has in store - One more dawn! One more day! One day more!
M	CROWD	Do you hear the people sing Singing the song of angry men? It is the music of a people Who will not be slaves again!
M	CROWD	When the beating of your heart Echoes the beating of the drums There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes!

M	ENJOLRAS	Will you give all you can give So that our banner may advance?

M	When the beating of your heart	Echoes the beating of the drums There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes!
M	STUDENTS/CROWD	Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see? Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? It is the future that we bring When tomorrow comes!
M	ENJOLRAS	To the barricades!
M	STUDENTS/CROWD	To the barricades! To arms! To arms!
M	ENJOLRAS	Here upon these stones We will build our barricade. In the heart of the city We claim as our own And don't be afraid.
M	ENJOLRAS	Wait! I will need a report On the strength of the foe.
M	JAVERT	I can find out the truth! I know their ways, Fought their wars, Served my time In the days Of my youth.
M	PROUVAIRE	See! The people unite!
M	GRANTAIRE	Pray your right
M	COMBEFERRE	Dogs will bark!
M	GAVROCHE	Fleas will bite!
M	LESGLES	They will do what is right.
M	ENJOLRAS	Red, the blood of angry men!
M	ALL	Black, the dark of ages past! Red, a world about to dawn! Black, the night that ends at last!
M	MARIUS	Hey, little boy, what's this I see? God Eponine the things you do!
M	EPONINE	I know this is no place for me, Still I would rather be with you!
M	MARIUS	Get out before the trouble starts! Get out, `Ponine, you might get shot!
M	EPONINE	I've got you worried now, I have! That shows you like me quite a lot...
M	MARIUS	Get Out!
M	JOLY	He's back!
M	JAVERT	Listen, my friends, I have done as I said. I have been to their lines, I have counted each man. I will tell what I can. Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel.
M	ENJOLRAS	Have faith! If you know what their movements are We'll spoil their game. There are ways that a people can fight - We shall overcome their power!
M	JAVERT	I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight. They intend to starve you out Before they start a proper fight - Concentrate their force, Hit us when it's light -
M	GAVROCHE	Liar!
M	GAVROCHE	Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear! I know this man, my friends. His name's Inspector Javert! So don't believe a word he says Cause none of it's true. This only goes to show What little people can do.
M	COURFEYRAC	Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class!
M	PROUVAIRE	So what are we going to do With this snake in the grass?
M	ENJOLRAS	Tie this man and take him To the tavern in there! The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert!
M	JAVERT	Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport! Death to each and every traitor! I renounce your people's court!
M	ENJOLRAS	Take this man. Bring him through. There is work we have to do.
M	ENJOLRAS	When are they coming!? Who's there?
M	ENJOLRAS	French Revolution.
M	ARMY OFFICER	Fire!
M	ENJOLRAS	Comrades, do not fire back! Do not waste powder!
M	ARMY OFFICER	Who's there? Get down!
M	MABEUF	Vive la France!
M	ARMY OFFICER	Fire!
M	MARIUS	Clear out or I'll blow up the barricade!
M	ARMY OFFICER	Blow it up then and take yourself with it!
M	MARIUS	And myself with it!
M	FEUILLY	Thank you!
M	LESGLES	What were you thinking!
M	MARIUS	Eponine! What have you done?
M	EPONINE	Here... It's from Cosette... I kept it from you... Don't be too hard on me...
M	MARIUS	Eponine, you're hurt! You need some help!
M	EPONINE	Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius - I don't feel any pain. A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now. You're here - that's all I need to know And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close And rain will make the flowers grow...
M	MARIUS	But you will live, Eponine - Dear God above! If I could close your wounds with words of love -
M	EPONINE	Just hold me now, and let it be. Shelter me... Comfort me...
M	MARIUS	You will live a hundred years If I could show you how... I won't desert you now...
M	EPONINE	The rain can't hurt me now... This rain will wash away what's past And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close I'll sleep in your embrace at last.
M	MARIUS	Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine You won't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt you now I'm here.
M	EPONINE	So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius I don't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now...
M	MARIUS	I will stay with you Till you are sleeping.
M	EPONINE	That's all I need to know And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close And rain.. Will make the flowers... Grow...
M	ENJOLRAS	They were the first to fall. The first to fall upon this barricade.
M	MARIUS	Her name was Eponine! Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid!
M	COMBEFERRE	We fight here in her name...
M	PROUVAIRE	She will not die in vain...
M	LESGLES	She will not be betrayed...
M	COURFEYRAC	Are you alright?
M	GAVROCHE	That was my sister.
M	MARIUS	Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de l'Homme Armé?
M	GAVROCHE	Course I do!
M	MARIUS	Will you take this for me?
M	GAVROCHE	Letter for Cosette.
M	VALJEAN	I'll take it.
M	GAVROCHE	Something for you, something for me. Who needs charity?
M	VALJEAN	`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.'
M	VALJEAN	They haven't got a chance, these boys They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy
M	VALJEAN	Don't shoot!
M	JOLY	Here comes a man in uniform! What brings you to this place?
M	VALJEAN	I come here as a volunteer.
M	JOLY	Approach and show your face!
M	PROUVAIRE	You wear an army uniform.
M	VALJEAN	That's why they let me through.
M	JOLY	You've got some years behind you, sir.
M	VALJEAN	There's much that I can do.
M	JOLY	You see that prisoner over there?
M	GRANTAIRE	A volunteer like you!
M	COMBEFERRE	A spy who calls himself Javert!
M	GRANTAIRE	He's going to get it too!
M	GAVROCHE	Don't shoot! I know him! He's no soldier!
M	ENJOLRAS	For your presence of mind, For the deed you have done, I will thank you, M'sieur, When our battle is won.
M	MARIUS	Thank you, M'sieur.
M	VALJEAN	Give me no thanks, M'sieur. There's something you can do.
M	ENJOLRAS	If it is in my power.
M	VALJEAN	Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him.
M	JAVERT	The law is inside out. The world is upside down.
M	ENJOLRAS	Do what you have to do - The man belongs to you.
M	ENJOLRAS	The enemy may be regrouping! Hold yourselves in readiness! Come, my friends, back to your positions! The dawn is breaking fast.
M	VALJEAN	We meet again...
M	JAVERT	You've hungered for this all your life. Take your revenge. How right you should kill with a knife.
M	VALJEAN	You talk too much. Your life is safe in my hands.
M	JAVERT	Don't understand...
M	VALJEAN	Get out of here.
M	JAVERT	Valjean, take care! I'm warning you.
M	VALJEAN	Clear out of here!
M	JAVERT	Once a thief, forever a thief. What you want, you always steal. You would trade your life for mine. Yes, Valjean, you want a deal! Shoot me now for all I care - If you let me go, beware! You'll still answer to Javert!
M	VALJEAN	You are wrong, and always have been wrong. I'm a man no worse than any man. You are free, and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions. There's nothing that I blame you for. You've done your duty, nothing more. No doubt our paths will cross again.
M	VALJEAN	Go!
M	ENJOLRAS	Courfeyrac, you take the watch - They may attack before it's light. Everybody keep the faith, For certain as our banner flies, We are not alone - The people too must rise!
M	ENJOLRAS	Marius, rest.
M	GRANTAIRE	Drink with me to days gone by!
M	FEUILLY	Sing with me the songs we knew!
M	PROUVAIRE	Here's to pretty girls Who went to our heads!
M	JOLY	Here's to witty girls Who went to our beds!
M	STUDENTS	Here's to them - And here's to you!
M	GRANTAIRE	Drink with me to days gone by! Can it be you fear to die? Will the world remember you when you fall? Can it be your death Means nothing at all? Is your life just one more lie?
M	ALL	Drink with me To days gone by! To the life That used to be! At the shrine of friendship Never say die... Let the wine of friendship Never run dry! Here's to you And here's to me!
M	MARIUS	Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea? Life without Cosette Means nothing at all.. Please don't weep, Cosette, Should Marius fall. Will you weep, Cosette, For me?
M	VALJEAN	God on high Hear my prayer In my need You have always been there. He is young He's afraid Let him rest Heaven blessed. Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home! He's like the son I might have known If God had granted me a son. The summers die One by one How soon they fly On and on And I am old And will be gone. Bring him peace Bring him joy He is young He is only a boy. You can take You can give Let him be Let him live, If I die, let me die Let him live Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home!
M	ENJOLRAS	The people have not stirred.
M	COURFEYRAC	Yet we will not abandon those Who still live in fear.
M	ENJOLRAS	The people have not heard, Yet we will not abandon those who cannot hear. Let us not waste lives! Let all who wish to Go from here!
M	GAVROCHE	Do you hear the people sing
M	GAVROCHE/COURFEYRAC	Singing the song of angry men
M	STUDENTS/CITIZENS	It is the music of the people Who will not be slaves again When the beating of your heart Echoes the beating of the drums There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes!
M	FEUILLY	Enjolras! Ammunition's short.
M	MARIUS	I will go into the streets. There are bodies all around. Ammunition to be had. Lots of bullets to be found.
M	ENJOLRAS	I can't let you go.
M	VALJEAN	Let me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear.
M	GAVROCHE	I volunteer!
M	COURFEYRAC	Come back, Gavroche! Don't you dare!
M	JOLY	Someone pull him down right now!
M	GAVROCHE	Look at me, I'm almost there!
M	GAVROCHE	Little people know When little people fight We may look easy pickings But we've got some bite! So never kick a dog When he's just a pup - We'll fight like twenty armies And we won't give up!
M	GAVROCHE	So you'd better run for cover When the pup grows -
M	COURFEYRAC	No-o!
M	ARMY OFFICER	You at the barricades listen to this! The people of Paris sleep in their beds! You have no chance, No chance at all! Why throw your lives away?
M	ENJOLRAS	Let us die facing our foes! Make them bleed while we can!
M	COMBEFERRE	Make'em pay through the nose!
M	COURFEYRAC	Make'em pay for every man!
M	ENJOLRAS	Until the earth is free!
M	GRANTAIRE	Long live the republic!
M	SOLDIER	Nothing here!
M	THENARDIER	Here's a hint of gold Stuck into a tooth - Pardon me, m'sieur, You won't be needing it no more. Shouldn't be too hard to sell.
M	THENARDIER	Well, someone's got to clean'em up, my friends, Before the little harvest Disappears into the mud. Someone's got to collect their odds and ends When the gutters run with blood.
M	THENARDIER	Here's a tasty ring Pretty little thing Heart's no longer going And he's lived his little time, But his watch is ticking yet.
M	It's a world where the dog eats	the dog. Where they kill for the bones in the street. And God in his heaven, He don't interfere Cos he's dead as the stiff at my feet! I raise my eyes to see the heavens And only the moon looks down. The harvest moon shines down!
M	VALJEAN	How do I get out of here?
M	THENARDIER	There! That way!
M	VALJEAN	It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care.
M	JAVERT	I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed!
M	VALJEAN	Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid.
M	JAVERT	The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice!
M	VALJEAN	Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave!
M	JAVERT	One more step and you die.
M	VALJEAN	Then I die.
M	JAVERT	Take him, Valjean, Before I change my mind! I will be waiting...
M	JAVERT	Who is this man? What sort of devil is he? To have caught me in a trap And choose to let me go free? It was his hour at last To put a seal on my fate Wipe out the past And wash me clean off the slate! All it would take Was a flick of his knife Vengeance was his And he gave me back my life!
M	JAVERT	Damned if I live in the debt of a thief! Damned if I yield at the end of the chase! I am the law and the law is not mocked! I'll spit his pity right back in his face! There is nothing on earth that we share! It is either Valjean or Javert! How can I allow this man To hold dominion over me? This desperate man that I have hunted... He gave me my life! He gave me freedom! hand It was his right... It was my right to die as well... Instead I live... But live in hell!
M	JAVERT	And my thoughts fly apart Can this man be believed? Shall his sins be forgiven? Shall his crimes be reprieved? Who never doubted all those years? My heart is stone and still it trembles... The world I have known is lost in shadow Is he from heaven or from hell? And does he know That granting me my life today This man has killed me even so?
M	JAVERT	I am reaching but I fall And the stars are black and cold As I stare into the void Of a world that cannot hold... From the world of Jean Valjean This is nowhere I can turn... There is no way to go on...
M	WOMAN 1	Did you see them Going off to fight?
M	WOMAN 2	Children of the barricade Who didn't last the night.
M	WOMAN 3	Did you see them Lying where they died? Someone used to cradle them And kiss them when they cried.
M	WOMAN 4	Did you see them lying side by side?
M	WOMAN 5	Who will wake them?
M	WOMAN 6	No one ever will.
M	WOMAN 2	No one ever told them that A summer day can kill.
M	WOMAN 7	They were schoolboys Never held a gun Fighting for a new world that Would rise up like the sun.
M	WOMAN 3	Where's that new world Now the fighting's done?
M	GILLENORMAND	Marius! You've come back to us!
M	MARIUS	Grandfather...
M	GILLENORMAND	Rest, Marius. No more harsh words between us. I just thank God you're alive.
M	GILLENORMAND	You've come home. To all of us.
M	WOMEN (O.S.)	Round and round And back where you began...
M	MARIUS	There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone.
M	MARIUS	Here they talked of revolution Here it was they lit the flame Here they sang about tomorrow And tomorrow never came...
M	From the table in the corner	They could see a world reborn And they rose with voices ringing And I can hear them now! The very words that they had sung Became their last communion On the lonely barricade at dawn.
M	MARIUS	Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on... Phantom shadows on the floor Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no more.
M	Oh my friends, my friends, don't	ask me What your sacrifice was for Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will sing no more.
F	COSETTE	Every day You walk with stronger step, You walk with longer step. The worst is over.
M	MARIUS	Every day I wonder every day Who it was brought me here From the barricade.
F	COSETTE	Don't think about it, Marius! With all the years ahead of us! I will never go away And we will be together Every day. Every day We'll remember that night And the vow that we made.
F	COSETTE	A heart full of love A night full of you The words are old But always true.
M	VALJEAN	She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free...
M	MARIUS	Cosette, Cosette!
F	COSETTE	I saw you waiting and I knew -
M	GILLENORMAND	Thank God, thank God you are here! Thank God, thank God you are home!
M	MARIUS	Waiting for you! At your feet!
F	COSETTE	At your call!
M	VALJEAN/GILLENORMAND	Love is the garden of the young Let it be Let it be! A heart full of love This I give you this day.
M	MARIUS/COSETTE	And it wasn't a dream Not a dream after all.
M	MARIUS	M'sieur, this is a day I never can forget. Is gratitude enough For giving me Cosette? Your home shall be with us And not a day shall pass But we will prove our love To you, whom we shall call A father to us both, A father to us all.
M	VALJEAN	Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done...
M	VALJEAN	There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his time In sweat he washed away his crime.
M	VALJEAN	Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life apart... How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be faced: If he is caught, she is disgraced... The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be gone! Who am I? Who am I?
M	MARIUS	You're Jean Valjean!
M	MARIUS	Monsieur, you cannot leave! Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette She will never believe me.
M	VALJEAN	Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know...
M	MARIUS	I give my word.
M	VALJEAN	...What I have spoken, why I must go.
M	MARIUS	For the sake of Cosette, it must be so.
F	COSETTE	Where's he gone without a word That wouldn't be his way to go
M	MARIUS	All he asked for me to say He's on a journey, far away. Dear Cosette, he loves you so Perhaps he will return some day.
F	COSETTE	He can't leave us now What's our wedding day Without him giving me away? "LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012 119.
M	WEDDING GUESTS	Ring out the bells Upon this day of days! May all the angels Of the Lord above In jubilation Sing their songs of praise! And crown this blessed time With peace and love!
M	MAJORDOMO	The Baron and Baroness du Thenard
M	THENARDIER	I forget where we met... Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge Where the Duke did that Puke Down the Duchess's decolletage?
M	MARIUS	No, `Baron du Thenard', The circles I move in are humbler by far... Go away, Thenardier! Do you think I don't know who you are?
M	MADAME THENARDIER	He's not fooled! Told you so! Show M'Sieur what you've come here to show. Tell the boy what you know! MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012 119A.
M	THENARDIER	Pity to disturb you at a feast like this But 500 francs surely wouldn't come amiss.
M	MARIUS	In God's name say what you have to say.
M	MADAME THENARDIER	He speaks. You pay!
M	THENARDIER	What I saw, clear as light, Jean Valjean in the sewers that night, Had this corpse on his back Some boy he'd killed in a viscious attack. I was there, never fear! Even found me this fine souvenir!
M	MARIUS	I know this! This was mine! This is surely some heavenly sign!
M	THENARDIER	And there's more! Mark this well - It was the night that the barricades fell.
M	MARIUS	Then it's true! Then I'm right! Jean Valjean was my saviour that night!
M	THENARDIER	Jean Valjean - the old con. You pay up and I'll say where he's gone. MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012 120.

M	MADAME THENARDIER	How's about some extra On a day so glad Our little orphan girl She hasn't done so bad. Raised in a convent Cash to spare - We want our share.
M	THENARDIER	Quite the little nun, ain't she!
M	MARIUS	Where is he?
M	THENARDIER	The convent. MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012 121.

M	THENARDIER	Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance! Life is easy pickings If you grab your chance!

M	THENARDIER	But they're mostly broke!

M	VALJEAN	Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep. I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep To know I die... Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace... God on high Take me now Where you are Let me be Take me there Bring me home Bring me home!
F	FANTINE	M'sieur I bless your name...
M	VALJEAN	I am ready, Fantine...
F	FANTINE	M'sieur lay down your burden... At the end of my days...
F	FANTINE	You raised my child in love,
M	VALJEAN	She's the best of my life...
F	FANTINE	And you will be with God.
M	VALJEAN	Cosette?
F	COSETTE	Papa, papa, I do not understand - Are you all right? Why did you go away?
M	VALJEAN	Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day!
M	MARIUS	It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool! It's you who must forgive a thankless man! It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet. Cosette, your father is a saint! When they wounded me He took me from the barricade, Carried like a babe, And brought me home to you!
M	VALJEAN	Now you are here Again beside me Now I can die in peace For now my life is blessed...
F	COSETTE	You will live, papa You're going to live It's too soon Too soon to say goodbye.
M	VALJEAN	Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die! I'll obey I will try...
M	VALJEAN	On this page I write my last confession. Read it well When I at last am sleeping. It's the story Of one who turned from hating A man who only learned to love When you were in his keeping.
F	COSETTE	I know it, papa.
M	VALJEAN	I'm ready now, Fantine.
F	FANTINE	Come with me Where chains will never bind you All your grief At last, at last behind you Lord in heaven Look down on him in mercy -
