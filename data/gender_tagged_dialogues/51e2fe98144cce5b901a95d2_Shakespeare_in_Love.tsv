M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	VOICE (O.S.)	You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it is I who am bitten?
M	FENNYMAN	What am I, Mr. Lambert?
M	LAMBERT	Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.
M	FENNYMAN	How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?
M	FREES	Twelve pounds, one shilling and four pence, Mr. Fennyman, including interest.
M	HENSLOWE	Aaagh! I can pay you!
M	FENNYMAN	When?
M	HENSLOWE	Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
M	FENNYMAN	Take his feet out. Where will you get --
M	FREES	Sixteen pounds, five shillings and nine pence --
M	FENNYMAN	Including interest in three weeks?
M	HENSLOWE	I have a wonderful new play!
M	FENNYMAN	Put his feet in.
M	HENSLOWE	It's a comedy.
M	FENNYMAN	Cut his nose off.
M	HENSLOWE	A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
M	FENNYMAN	And his ears.
M	HENSLOWE	And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
M	FENNYMAN	Partners!
M	HENSLOWE	It's a crowd-tickler -- mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
M	LAMBERT	I think I've seen it. I didn't like it.
M	HENSLOWE	This time it is by Shakespeare.
M	FENNYMAN	What's the title?
M	HENSLOWE	Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
M	FENNYMAN	Good title.
M	FENNYMAN	A play takes time. Find actors... rehearsals... let's say open in three weeks. That's -- what -- five hundred groundlings at tuppence each, in addition four hundred groundlings tuppence each, in addition four hundred backsides at three pence -- a penny extra for a cushion, call it two hundred cushions, say two performance for safety how much is that Mr. Frees?
M	FREES	Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
M	FENNYMAN	Correct!
M	HENSLOWE	But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
M	FENNYMAN	A share of the profits.
M	HENSLOWE	There's never any.
M	FENNYMAN	Of course not!
M	HENSLOWE	Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
M	FENNYMAN	Sign here.
M	FENNYMAN	Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter... Almost finished?
M	HENSLOWE	Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
M	HENSLOWE	Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?
M	WILL	Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move.
M	HENSLOWE	No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
M	WILL	It is all locked safe in here.
M	HENSLOWE	God be praised! Locked?
M	WILL	As soon as I have found my muse.
M	HENSLOWE	Who is she this time?!
M	WILL	She is always Aphrodite.
M	HENSLOWE	Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
M	WILL	Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
M	HENSLOWE	Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful --
M	WILL	What piece? Richard Crookback?
M	HENSLOWE	No... it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
M	WILL	Who wrote that?
M	HENSLOWE	Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
M	WILL	Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
M	HENSLOWE	Will! What is money to you and me? I, your patron, you my wordwright! When the plague lifts Burbage will have a new Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain and I have nothing for the Rose.
M	WILL	Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
M	HENSLOWE	Fifty pounds? What for?
M	WILL	Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
M	HENSLOWE	Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
M	WILL	No, then.
M	MAKEPEACE	And the Lord shall smite them! Yea, harken to me. The theatres are handmaidens of the devil! Under the name of the Curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children! And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name! I say a plague on both their houses!
M	HENSLOWE	Where are you going?
M	WILL	To my weekly confession.
M	WILL	Words, words, wordsâ€¦once, I had the gift... I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones... for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery... but now --
M	DR. MOTH	And yet you tell me you lie with women?
M	DR. MOTH	Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and --
M	WILL	Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
M	DR. MOTH	I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
M	WILL	I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
M	DR. MOTH	Interesting.
M	WILL	Nothing comes.
M	DR. MOTH	Most interesting.
M	WILL	It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
M	DR. MOTH	Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
M	DR. MOTH	How long has it been?
M	WILL	A goodly length in times past, but lately --
M	DR. MOTH	No, no. You have a wife, children.
M	LATER	Not much sand left.
M	WILL	I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway was a woman, half as old again.
M	DR. MOTH	A woman of property?
M	WILL	She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so --
M	DR. MOTH	And your relations?
M	WILL	On my mother's side the Ardens --
M	DR. MOTH	No, your marriage bed.
M	WILL	Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
M	DR. MOTH	So now you are free to love.
M	WILL	Yet cannot love nor write it.
M	DR. MOTH	Here is a bangle found in Psyche's temple on Olympus cheap at four pence. Write your name on a paper and feed it in the snake.
M	WILL	Will it restore my gift?
M	DR. MOTH	The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
M	HENSLOWE	Now where? Will?
M	WILL	To the Palace at Whitehall.
M	WILL	Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You too, good Crab.
M	KEMPE	Crab is nervous. He has never played the Palace. When will you write me a tragedy, Will? I could do it.
M	WILL	No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it.
M	BURBAGE	My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress Rosaline, where were my seamstress's eyes?
M	BURBAGE	There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
M	WILL	I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
M	BURBAGE	Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
M	WILL	When I have fifty pounds.
M	BURBAGE	Are you writing?
M	WILL	A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
M	BURBAGE	What is the chief part?
M	WILL	Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
M	BURBAGE	The title?
M	WILL	Romeo --
M	BURBAGE	I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
M	WILL	It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
M	BURBAGE	How much?
M	WILL	Ten pounds.
M	BURBAGE	You're a liar.
M	WILL	I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
M	BURBAGE	Ned is wrong for it.
M	BURBAGE	Here is two sovereigns -- I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
M	WILL	Done.
M	HENSLOWE	Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
M	BURBAGE	The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
M	HENSLOWE	And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
M	BURBAGE	Ask him.
M	TILNEY	She comes!
M	CONDELL AS VALENTINE	"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus; Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits..."
F	ROSALINE	When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
M	WILL	I have lost my gift.
F	ROSALINE	You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
M	WILL	Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
F	ROSALINE	Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
M	WILL	You see? The consumptives plot against me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it."
M	CONDELL AS VALENTINE	"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights..."
M	WILL	I feel a scene coming on.
M	HENSLOWE	Is it about a pirate's daughter?
M	HENSLOWE	You see? Comedy.
F	QUEEN	Well played, Master Crab, I commend you.
M	HENSLOWE	Love and a bit with a dog, that's what they like.
M	CONDELL AS VALENTINE	"What light is light if Silvia be not seen? What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection..."
M	HENSLOWE	There's a lady knows your play by heart.
F	VIOLA	Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
M	NURSE	I liked the dog, for laughs.
F	VIOLA	But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
M	NURSE	When the Queen commands it.
F	VIOLA	But at the playhouse. Nurse?
M	NURSE	Be still.
M	NURSE	Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
F	VIOLA	I am not so well-born.
M	NURSE	Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
F	VIOLA	All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
M	NURSE	Like Valentine and Silvia?
F	VIOLA	No... not the artful postures of love, but love that overthrows life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a...
M	NURSE	As a nurse.
F	VIOLA	But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
M	NURSE	Clean your teeth while you dream, then.
M	NURSE	Now spit.
M	FENNYMAN	This time we take your boots off!
M	HENSLOWE	What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
M	FENNYMAN	The theatres are all closed by the plague!
M	HENSLOWE	Oh, that.
M	FENNYMAN	By order of the Master of the Revels!
M	HENSLOWE	Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be closed by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
M	FENNYMAN	So what do we do?
M	HENSLOWE	Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well.
M	FENNYMAN	How?
M	HENSLOWE	I don't know. It's a mystery.
M	LAMBERT	Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?
M	MESSENGER	The theatres are reopened. By order of the Master of the Revels, the theatres are reopened.
M	FREES	Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened the playhouses.
M	FENNYMAN	Yes I heard.
M	HENSLOWE	If you wouldn't mind.
M	FENNYMAN	Where is the play?
M	HENSLOWE	Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
M	HENSLOWE	Will! The theatres are --
M	WILL	Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
M	HENSLOWE	Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
M	WILL	Richard!
M	WILL	Burbage?
M	WILL	Mr. Tilney.
M	TILNEY	Like you, I found him not at home!
M	WILL	So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
F	ROSALINE	Will!
M	WILL	I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
M	TILNEY	What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
M	WILL	You have opened the playhouses?
M	TILNEY	I have, Master Shakespeare.
M	WILL	But the plague?
M	TILNEY	Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
F	ROSALINE	Will... you're the only one, Will... in my heart.
M	NOL	Mr. Henslowe!
M	HENSLOWE	Yes, I heard. The theatres are open. But where is my playwright?
M	HENSLOWE	Chalk it up, Nol. I'm hungry, too.
M	NOL	The special today is a pig's foot marinated in juniper-berry vinegar, served with a buckwheat pancake which has been --
M	HENSLOWE	Will! Have you finished?
M	WILL	Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
M	HENSLOWE	Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men are out on tour. I need actors. Those here who are unknown will have a chance to be known.
M	ACTOR	What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
M	HENSLOWE	It won't cost you a penny! Auditions in half-an-hour!
M	HENSLOWE	Ralph Bashford! I'd have a part for you but, alas, I hear you are a drunkard's drunkard.
M	RALPH	Never when I'm working.
M	WILL	Give me to drink mandragora.
M	BARMAN	Straight up, Will?
M	VOICE	Give my friend a beaker of your best brandy.
M	WILL	Kit.
M	MARLOWE	How goes it, Will?
M	WILL	Wonderful, wonderful.
M	MARLOWE	Burbage says you have a play.
M	WILL	I have. And chinks to show for it.
M	WILL	I insist -- and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe.
M	WILL	I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
M	MARLOWE	Not new -- my Doctor Faustus.
M	WILL	I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
M	MARLOWE	I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
M	WILL	Good title.
M	MARLOWE	And yours?
M	WILL	Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know.
M	MARLOWE	What is the story?
M	WILL	Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word.
M	MARLOWE	Romeo is... Italian. Always in and out of love.
M	WILL	Yes, that's good. Until he meets --
M	MARLOWE	Ethel.
M	WILL	Do you think?
M	MARLOWE	The daughter of his enemy.
M	WILL	The daughter of his enemy.
M	MARLOWE	His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
M	WILL	Mercutio... good name.
M	NOL	Will... they're waiting for you!
M	WILL	I'm coming.
M	WILL	Good luck with yours, Kit.
M	MARLOWE	I thought your play was for Burbage.
M	WILL	This is a different one.
M	MARLOWE	A different one you haven't written?
M	YOUNG ACTOR	"...Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!"
M	HENSLOWE	Thank you.
M	SECOND ACTOR	I would like to give you something from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.
M	HENSLOWE	How refreshing.
M	SECOND ACTOR	"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
M	URCHIN	"...the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a --
M	HENSLOWE	Thank you!
M	WABASH	"W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f- f- ff- FACE..."
M	HENSLOWE	Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. Report to the property master.
M	HENSLOWE	My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
M	WILL	I did not.
M	HENSLOWE	Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
M	WILL	Tomorrow.
M	WILL	Please God.
M	ACTOR	May I begin, sir?
M	WILL	Your name?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	"What light is light, if Silvia be not seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection.
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	"...except I be by Silvia in the night, There is no music in the nightingale. Unless I look on Silvia in the day, There is no day for me to look upon."
M	WILL	Take off your hat.
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	My hat?
M	WILL	Where did you learn how to do that?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	I...
M	WILL	Wait there.
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
M	WILL	Let me see you. Take off your hat.
M	ACTOR	What are we playing?
M	NOL	Where are the pages?
M	WILL	Where's the boy?
M	WABASH	B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!
M	WILL	Follow that boat!
M	BOATMAN	Right you are, governor!
M	BOATMAN	I know your face. Are you an actor?
M	WILL	Yes.
M	BOATMAN	Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
M	WILL	Really?
M	BOATMAN	I had Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
M	WILL	Do you know that house?
M	BOATMAN	Sir Robert De Lesseps.
M	LADY DE LESSEPS	Where is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too, bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled tonight.
M	LADY DE LESSEPS	Tomorrow he drags me off to the country and it will be three weeks gone before we return from our estates.
F	VIOLA	God save you, mother. Hot water, nurse.
M	SCULLERY MAID (O.S.)	Thomas Kent, sir? No sir.
M	WILL (O.S.)	The actor.
M	NURSE	Who asks for him?
M	WILL	William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and playwright of the Rose.
M	NURSE	Master Kent is... my nephew.
M	WILL	I will wait.
M	NURSE	Much god may it do you.
F	VIOLA	He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
M	NURSE	Verona again.
F	VIOLA	A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
M	SERVANT	Be off!
M	NURSE	Your mother, and your father.
F	VIOLA	From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
M	NURSE	He looks well enough for a mountebank.
F	VIOLA	Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
M	NURSE	My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
F	VIOLA	You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
M	WILL	Master Plum! What business here?
M	MUSICIAN	A five shilling business, Will. We play for the dancing.
M	SERVANT	Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's orders.
M	WILL	I seek Master Thomas Kent.
M	SIR ROBERT	She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
M	WESSEX	My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
M	SIR ROBERT	She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
M	WESSEX	Is she obedient?
M	SIR ROBERT	As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
M	WESSEX	I like her.
M	WILL	By all the stars in heaven, who is she?
M	MUSICIAN	Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.
F	VIOLA	Master Shakespeare!
M	WESSEX	My lady Viola.
F	VIOLA	My lord.
M	WESSEX	I have spoken with your father.
F	VIOLA	So my lord? I speak with him every day.
F	VIOLA	Good sir...?
F	VIOLA	I heard you are a poet.
F	VIOLA	But a poet of no words?
M	WESSEX	"Poet?"
M	WILL	not noticing the I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
M	WILL	How do I offend, my lord?
M	WESSEX	By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
M	WILL	Christopher Marlowe at your service.
F	VIOLA	Romeo, Romeo... a young man of Verona. A comedy. By William Shakespeare.
M	WILL	My lady!
F	VIOLA	Who is there?
M	WILL	Will Shakespeare!
F	VIOLA	Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master Shakespeare?!
M	WILL	The same, alas.
F	VIOLA	Oh but why "alas?"
M	WILL	A lowly player.
F	VIOLA	Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
M	WILL	Oh... I am him too!
F	VIOLA	Anon, anon! I will come again.
M	WILL	Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be punished for this!
M	WILL	Oh my lady, my love!
F	VIOLA	If they find you here they will kill you.
M	WILL	You can bring them with a word.
F	VIOLA	Oh, not for the world!
F	VIOLA	Anon, nurse!
M	JOHN	"Draw if you be men! Gregory, remember thy washing blow."
M	NOL	"Part, fools, put up your swords."
M	HENSLOWE	It starts well, and then it's all long-faced about some Rosaline. Where's the comedy, Will. Where's the dog? Do you think it is funny?
M	RALPH	I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. That's funny.
M	WILL	We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
M	HENSLOWE	We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
M	WILL	Who are you, master?
M	URCHIN	I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
M	WILL	I'll be damned if you are!
M	FENNYMAN	Is it going well?
M	HENSLOWE	Very well.
M	FENNYMAN	But nothing is happening.
M	HENSLOWE	Yes, but very well.
M	WILL	Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
M	FENNYMAN	Who is that?
M	HENSLOWE	Nobody. The author.
M	WILL	We are about to embark on a great voyage.
M	HENSLOWE	It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
M	WILL	You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go.
M	ALLEYN	Huzzah! The Admiral's Men are returned to the house!
M	FENNYMAN	Who is this?
M	ALLEYN	Silence, you god! I am Hieronimo! I am Tamburlaine! I am Faustus! I am Barrabas, the Jew of Malta -- of yes, Master Will, and I am Henry VI. What is the play, and what is my part?
M	FENNYMAN	A moment, sir!
M	ALLEYN	Who are you?
M	FENNYMAN	I am the money!
M	ALLEYN	Then you may remain so long as you remain silent. Pay attention and you will see how genius creates a legend.
M	FENNYMAN	Thank you, sir.
M	WILL	We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona.
M	ALLEYN	And the title of this piece?
M	WILL	Mercutio --
M	HENSLOWE	Is it?
M	ALLEYN	I will play him!
M	WILL	Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
M	SAM	I am, Master Shakespeare.
M	WILL	But your voice... Have they dropped?
M	SAM	No, no, a touch of cold only.
M	WILL	Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
M	FENNYMAN	I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
M	WILL	Yes, I saw it.
M	FENNYMAN	Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe.
M	WILL	Better fortune, boy.
M	URCHIN	I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
M	WILL	You admire it?
M	URCHIN	I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
M	WILL	Oh. What is your name?
M	URCHIN	John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty.
M	URCHIN	Plenty of blood. That is the only writing.
M	URCHIN	Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
M	WILL	I have to get back.
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO	"See where he comes. So please you step aside; I'll know his grievance or be much denied."
M	MONTAGUE	"I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away."
M	WILL	Cut round him for now.
M	HENSLOWE	What? Who?
M	WILL	Romeo.
M	HENSLOWE	The one who came with your letter?
M	WILL	What?
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO (O.S.)	"Good morrow, cousin."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO (O.S.)	"Is the day so young?"
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO	"But new struck nine."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
M	WILL	Good.
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO	"In love?"
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Out."
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO	"Of love?"
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Out of her favour where I am in love."
M	WILL	No, no, no... Don't spend it all at once!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Yes, sir.
M	WILL	Do you understand me?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	No, sir.
M	WILL	He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
M	HENSLOWE	Juliet? You mean Ethel.
M	WILL	God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
M	WILL	Of course you have not! I have not written it!
M	WILL	Go once more!
M	ALLEYN	Will... Where is Mercutio?
M	WILL	Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
M	HENSLOWE	A sonnet? You mean a play.
M	WESSEX	Two hours at prayer!
M	NURSE	Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
M	WESSEX	Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
M	NURSE	It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
M	WESSEX	It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
M	WESSEX	My lady VIOLA.
F	VIOLA	Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
M	WESSEX	I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
F	VIOLA	You flatter, my lord.
M	WESSEX	No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
F	VIOLA	Do you intend to marry, my lord?
M	WESSEX	Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.
F	VIOLA	I do not love you, my lord.
M	WESSEX	How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
F	VIOLA	Virginia?!
M	WESSEX	Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work -- I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years...
F	VIOLA	But why me?
M	WESSEX	It was your eyes. No, your lips.
M	WESSEX	Will you defy your father and your Queen?
F	VIOLA	The Queen has consented?
M	WESSEX	She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
F	VIOLA	I will do my duty, my lord.
M	ALLEYN	Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!
M	ALLEYN	Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! Are you a lady, Mr. Kent?
M	WILL	You did not like the speech?
M	ALLEYN	The speech is excellent. "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
M	WILL	There you have his duel, a skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard: "a plague on both your houses!"
M	ALLEYN	He dies?
M	BURBAGE	Will!
M	BURBAGE	And where are my pages...
M	WILL (O.S.)	Did you give her my letter?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	And this for you.
M	WILL	Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
M	BOATMAN	Writer, is he?
M	WILL	Row your boat.
M	WILL	She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	If you love her, you must do what she asks.
M	WILL	And break her heart and mine?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	It is only ours you can know.
M	WILL	She loves me, Thomas!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Does she say so?
M	WILL	No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	I... Her letter came to me by the nurse.
M	WILL	Your aunt?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
M	WILL	Like a sickness and its cure together.
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat. Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
M	WILL	Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	And her lips?
M	WILL	Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	And her voice? Like lark song?
M	WILL	Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	She sings too?
M	WILL	Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom -- did I mention her bosom?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	What of her bosom?
M	WILL	Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
M	WILL	Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	But what of Lord Wessex?
M	WILL	For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
F	VIOLA	Oh, Will!
M	BOATMAN	Thank you, my lady!
M	WILL	Lady?
M	BOATMAN	Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
M	BOATMAN	Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a writer myself.
M	BOATMAN	It wouldn't take you long to read it, I expect you know all the booksellers...
M	WILL	Can you love a fool?
F	VIOLA	Can you love a player?
M	WILL	Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
F	VIOLA	Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
M	WILL	I am.
F	VIOLA	Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
F	VIOLA	I do not know how to undress a man.
M	WILL	It is strange to me, too.
M	NURSE	Go to, go to.
F	VIOLA	I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
M	WILL	There is.
F	VIOLA	Even your play.
M	WILL	Oh.
F	VIOLA	And that was only my first try.
M	WILL	Well perhaps better than my first.
F	VIOLA	Will.
F	VIOLA	You would not leave me?
M	WILL	I must. Look... how pale the window.
F	VIOLA	Moonlight!
M	WILL	No, the morning rooster woke me.
F	VIOLA	It was the owl... come to bed.
M	WILL	Oh, let Henslowe wait.
F	VIOLA	Mr. Henslowe?
M	WILL	Let him be damned for his pages!
F	VIOLA	Oh... no, no!
M	WILL	There is time. It is still dark.
F	VIOLA	It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!
M	WILL	It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
F	VIOLA	You would leave us players without a scene to read today?!
M	NURSE	My lady, the house is stirring, it is a new day.
F	VIOLA	It is a new world!
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"...Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Saints do not move, though grant for prayer's sake."
M	SAM	It's you.
M	ALLEYN	Suffering cats!
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
M	WILL	Yes... yes... er... not quite right... it is more... let me -- "Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"You kiss by the book."
M	ALLEYN	Well! It was lucky you were here! Why do not I write the rest of your play while you --
M	WILL	Yes, yes... continue. Now the Nurse. Where is Ralph?
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"Madam, your mother craves a word with you."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"What is her mother?"
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"Marry bachelor, Her mother is the lady of the house..."
M	RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)	"...And a good lady, and wise and virtuous. I nurse her daughter that you talk'd withal..."
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"I tell you, he that can lay hold of her. Shall have the chinks."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Is she a Capulet" Oh dear account. My life is my foe's debt."
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO	"Away, be gone, the sport is at best."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest."
M	SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)	"Come hither nurse. What is yond gentleman?"
F	VIOLA	Oh let it be night!
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"I know not."
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Go ask his name -- If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
F	VIOLA	Oh, do not go.
M	WILL	I must. I must.
M	RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)	"His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy."
M	ALLEYN (O.S.)	Terrible!
M	VIOLA (V.O.)	"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun!"
F	VIOLA	"Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she..."
F	VIOLA	Oh, Will!
M	WILL	Yes, some of it is speakable.
F	VIOLA	"It is my lady, O it is my love! O that she knew she were!"
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek."
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Ay me."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"She speaks. Oh speak again bright angel..."
M	WILL	"Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name."
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love And I'll no longer be a Capulet."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this?"
M	WILL	"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my counsel?"
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"...By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee..."
M	WILL	"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. If they do see thee, they will murder thee."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye, Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity."
M	SAM AS JULIET	I would not for the world!
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
M	WILL	"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
F	VIOLA	That's my line!
M	WILL	Oh, but it is mine too!
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
M	SAM AS JULIET	"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
M	WILL	"My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep --
M	VIOLA AND WILL	...the more I give to thee The more I have, for both are infinite."
M	SAM AS JULIET	"I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu."
F	VIOLA	Anon, good Nurse.
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Anon, good Nurse -- Sweet Montague be true."
M	WILL	"Stay but a little, I will come again."
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Stay but a little, I will come again."
M	VIOLA AS ROMEO	"Oh blessed blessed night."
F	VIOLA	"I am feared, Being in night, all this but a dream, Too flattering- sweet to be substantial."
M	SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)	"...All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"Madam!"
M	SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)	"I come, anon... But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee --"
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"Madam!"
M	SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)	By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
M	SAM	I cannot move in this dress! And it makes me look like a pig! I have no neck in this pig dress! Oh, she's off again! She says she's going and then she doesn't.
M	WILL	How is it?
M	PETER	It's all right.
M	WILL	Ned... I know... I know --
M	ALLEYN	It's good.
M	WILL	Oh.
M	ALLEYN	The title won't do.
M	WILL	Ah.
M	ALLEYN	Romeo and Juliet -- just a suggestion.
M	WILL	Thank you, Ned.
M	WILL	You are a gentleman.
M	ALLEYN	And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
M	HENSLOWE	You mean, no dog of any kind?
M	PETER	The Friar married them in secret, then Ned gets into a fight with one of the Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he gets in Ned's way, I mean in Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt. Then the Prince banishes him from Verona.
M	HENSLOWE	That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King.
M	FENNYMAN	Cease your prattling! Get out! A thousand apologies!
M	SAM AS JULIET	"Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow."
M	WILL	Sunday... it is Sunday.
M	WILL	I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
F	VIOLA	Oh, but it will end well for love?
M	WILL	In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers -- family, duty, fate -- as unchangeable as nature.
F	VIOLA	Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
M	WESSEX (O.S.)	Not ready? Where is she?
M	NURSE (O.S.)	Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
M	WESSEX (O.S.)	Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
F	VIOLA	Sunday! Greenwich!
M	WESSEX	Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen, Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel, the Radiant One, who shines her light on us, is at Greenwich today, and prepared, during the evening's festivities, to bestow her gracious favour on my choice of wife -- and if we're late for lunch, the old boot will not forgive. So you get you to my lady's chamber and produce her with or without her undergarments.
M	WILL	You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
F	VIOLA	What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
M	WILL	To be the wife of a poor player? Can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
F	VIOLA	You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
M	WILL	Then I will go with you.
F	VIOLA	You cannot, Wessex will kill you!
M	WILL	I know how to fight!
F	VIOLA	Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
M	WESSEX	By heaven, I will drag her down, by the Queen's command.
F	VIOLA	Good morning, my lord!
M	WESSEX	Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
M	WILL	Here we come at last, my lord!
M	WESSEX	Are you bringing your laundry woman?
M	WILL	Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
M	WESSEX	On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps.
M	WILL	Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
M	WESSEX	Now?
M	LORD IN WAITING	Now.
M	WESSEX	The Queen asks for you. Answer well.
M	WESSEX	Is there a man?
M	WILL	A man, my lord?
M	WESSEX	There was a man, poet -- a theatre poet, I heard -- does he come to the house?
M	WILL	A theatre poet?
M	WESSEX	An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe -- has he been to the house?
M	WILL	Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
M	WESSEX	That dog!
F	VIOLA	Your Majesty.
F	QUEEN	Stand up straight, girl.
F	QUEEN	I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays -- at Whitehall, at Richmond.
F	VIOLA	Your Majesty.
F	QUEEN	What do you love so much?
F	VIOLA	Your Majesty?
F	QUEEN	Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
F	VIOLA	I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed --
F	QUEEN	They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
F	QUEEN	And--?
F	VIOLA	And I love poetry above all.
F	QUEEN	Above Lord Wessex?
F	QUEEN	My Lord... when you cannot find your wife you had better look for her at the playhouse.
F	QUEEN	But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
F	VIOLA	Oh, but they can!
F	VIOLA	I mean... Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can --
M	WESSEX	Lady Viola is... young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
F	QUEEN	I thought you were here because you had none.
F	QUEEN	Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
M	WILL	Fifty pounds!
F	QUEEN	Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a very worthy question. Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love? I bear witness to the wager, and will be the judge of it as occasion arises. of applause. She I have not seen anything to settle it yet. So... the fireworks will be soothing after the excitements of Lady Viola's audience. to WESSEX who is Have her then, but you are a lordly fool. She has been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you. It takes a woman to know it.
M	WESSEX	Marlowe!
M	MARLOWE	Burbage!
M	BURBAGE'S VOICE	Who's there?
M	MARLOWE	Marlowe.
M	BURBAGE'S VOICE	Kit!
M	MARLOWE	You are playing my Faustus this afternoon. Don't spend yourself in sport.
F	ROSALINE	This afternoon! We'll still be here this afternoon.
M	BURBAGE	What do you want, Kit?
M	MARLOWE	My Massacre at Paris is complete.
M	BURBAGE	You have the last act?
M	MARLOWE	You have the money?
M	BURBAGE	Tomorrow.
M	MARLOWE	Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
M	BURBAGE	Wait! Will you desist!
M	MARLOWE	Twenty pounds on delivery.
M	BURBAGE	What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
M	MARLOWE	Romeo? He gave it to Henslowe.
M	BURBAGE	Never!
M	MARLOWE	Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
M	BURBAGE	I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
M	MARLOWE	You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
M	BURBAGE	Treachery!
M	BURBAGE	Traitor and thief!
M	NOL AS BENVOLIO	"By my head, here comes the Capulets."
M	ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO	"By my heel, I care not."
M	JAMES HEMMINGS AS TYBALT	"Follow me close, for I will speak to them. Gentlemen, good e'en: a word with one of you."
M	ALLEYN	Are you going to do it like that?
M	ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO)	And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something, make it a word and a blow.
M	BURBAGE	Where is that thieving hack who can't keep his pen in his own ink pot!?
M	WILL	What is this rabble?!
M	FENNYMAN	Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!
M	HENSLOWE	Not with my props!
F	VIOLA	Will! What?
M	WILL	A literary feud. Quite normal.
M	WILL	Stay hid!
M	WILL	I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were cast ashore in a far country.
M	HENSLOWE	We need that for the balcony scene!
M	HENSLOWE	My poor Rose!
M	FENNYMAN	My investment! LAMBERT!!!
M	FENNYMAN	Vengeance!
M	HENSLOWE	I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business --
M	FENNYMAN	Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business.
M	FENNYMAN	A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open and on the house! Oh what happy hour! Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to yourself I'll not have you infecting my investment!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Is this a tavern?
M	WILL	It is also a tavern.
M	PRETTY WHORE	I remember you! The poet!
M	PRETTY WHORE	One at a time, one at a time!
M	SECOND WHORE	Oh, he's a pretty one! Tell me your story while I tickle your fancy!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill-repute!
M	WILL	It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
M	RALPH	Never when I'm working!
M	PRETTY WHORE	Never tried it? Never? I think you are ready, Sam!
M	FENNYMAN	You are welcome to my best house! Here's to the Admiral's Men!
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	The Admiral's Men!
M	SAM	I... quite liked it.
M	FENNYMAN	Master Kent! You have not dipped your wick?
M	VIOLA AS THOMAS	My wick?
M	WILL	Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
M	FENNYMAN	By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
M	FENNYMAN	I am to be in your play.
M	WHORE	And what is this play about?
M	RALPH	Well, there's this Nurse.
M	FENNYMAN	Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
M	HENSLOWE	The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
M	WILL	By God, I wish I knew.
M	HENSLOWE	By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
M	PETER	Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!
M	PETER	A black day for us all! There is news come up river from Deptford.
M	PETER	Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern at Deptford!
M	WILL	Oh... what have I done?
M	ALLEYN	He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
M	WILL	It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God forgive me!
M	WESSEX	You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
F	VIOLA	It is not my riding day, my lord.
M	WESSEX	Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
F	VIOLA	I am going to church.
M	WESSEX	I understand of course. It is to be expected.
F	VIOLA	It is to be expected on a Sunday.
M	WESSEX	And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
F	VIOLA	Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
M	WESSEX	Oh! Dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
F	VIOLA	He is dead?
M	WESSEX	Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul.
M	NURSE	My lady... my lady... now is the time to show your breeding.
M	WESSEX	Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the love of Christ!
M	WESSEX	Spare me!
F	VIOLA	Will!
F	VIOLA	Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!
M	WILL	It is worse. I have killed a man.
M	WILL	Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
F	VIOLA	You never spoke so well of him.
M	WILL	He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
F	VIOLA	You lie.
F	VIOLA	You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
M	WILL	My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
F	VIOLA	Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
M	WILL	I was the more deceived.
M	VOILA	Yes -- you were deceived. For I never loved you till now.
M	WILL	Now?
F	VIOLA	I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
M	WILL	Oh, my love. You ran from me before.
F	VIOLA	You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
M	WILL	You cannot marry Wessex!
F	VIOLA	If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
M	WILL	No... no.
F	VIOLA	But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
M	WILL	For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio, Romeo is banished.
M	WILL	But the Friar who married Romeo and Juliet...
M	ACTOR (EDWARD)	Is that me. Will?
M	WILL	You, Edward. The Friar who married them gives Juliet a potion to drink. It is a secret potion. It makes her seeming dead. She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets. She will awake to life and love when Romeo comes to her side again.
M	WILL	I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
M	FENNYMAN	That's me.
M	WILL	And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
M	WILL	And so Juliet takes his dagger and kills herself.
M	HENSLOWE	Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
M	FENNYMAN	Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
M	ALLEYN	Yes... it will serve. But there's a scene missing between marriage and death.
M	WILL	The play. All written out for you. I had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering.
M	WILL	There's a new scene.
F	VIOLA	Will you read it for me?
M	WILL	"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
F	VIOLA	"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
M	WILL	"Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer..."
M	WILL	"...thou need'st not to be gone."
F	VIOLA	"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
M	TILNEY	You will go far, I fear.
M	WEBSTER	I hope we work together again.
M	FENNYMAN	"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them." Then him. Then me.
M	FENNYMAN	"Put this in any liquid thing you will And..."
M	FENNYMAN	"Such mortal drugs I have..." What is it? What is it?
M	WEBSTER	My lord!
M	WESSEX	Shakespeare!
M	WESSEX	You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
M	WILL	You are on my ground.
M	WESSEX	By God, I'll fight the lot of you.
M	WILL	I am more than enough.
M	WILL	Absent friends! This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!
M	ALLEYN	Will!
M	WESSEX	I rejoiced at his death because I thought it was yours. That is all I know of Marlowe.
M	ALLEYN	It's true, Will... it was a tavern brawl... Marlowe attacked, and got his own knife in the eye. A quarrel about the bill.
M	HENSLOWE	The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!
M	ALLEYN	Not the billing, the bill!
M	WILL	Oh God, I am free of it!
M	WESSEX	Close it!
M	TILNEY	My Lord Wessex!
M	WESSEX	Close it! Take it down stone by stone! I want it ploughed into the ground, and sown with quick lime!
M	HENSLOWE	Mr. Tilney, what is this?
M	TILNEY	Sedition and indecency!
M	HENSLOWE	What?!
M	WEBSTER	Master of the Revels, sir, over here, sir.
M	TILNEY	Where, boy?
M	WEBSTER	I saw her bubbies!
M	TILNEY	A woman on the stage? A woman?
M	WEBSTER	I swear it!
M	TILNEY	So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is closed! On the authority of the powers invested in my by the court -- I close this theatre!
M	HENSLOWE	Why so?
M	TILNEY	For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For displaying a female on the public stage!
M	WEBSTER	Not him. Her!
M	HENSLOWE	He's a woman!
M	TILNEY	That's who I meant! This theatre is closed! Notice will be posted!
M	HENSLOWE	Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
F	VIOLA	Nobody knew!
M	WEBSTER	He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!
M	TILNEY	Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!
M	HENSLOWE	It is over.
F	VIOLA	I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will.
M	WABASH	Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w- wonderful.
F	VIOLA	Thank you.
M	FENNYMAN	Everything all right?
M	FENNYMAN	I would have been good... I would have been great.
M	RALPH	So would I. We both would.
M	FENNYMAN	Lambert!
M	FENNYMAN	Kill him!
M	ALLEYN	Well, Burbage -- you never did know when your scene was over.
M	BURBAGE	That can wait. The Master of the Revels despises us for vagrants, tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But my father, James Burbage, had the first licence to make a company of players from Her Majesty, and he drew from poets the literature of the age. Their fame will be our fame. So let them all know, we are men of parts. We are a brotherhood, and we will be a profession. Will Shakespeare has a play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is yours.
M	BY PERMISSION OF	A THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE ROMEO AND JULIET With Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary.
M	HENSLOWE	Will!
M	HENSLOWE	We'll be needing a Romeo.
M	WESSEX	My ship is moored at Bankside, bound for Virginia on the afternoon tide -- please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps, you are gaining a colony.
M	DE LESSEPS	And you are gaining five thousand pounds, my lord... by these drafts in my hand.
M	WESSEX	Would you oblige me with fifty or so in gold? Just to settle my accounts at the dockside?
M	WESSEX	Ah! Look, she comes!
F	VIOLA	Good morning, my lord. I see you are open for business so let's to church.
M	NURSE	My lord!
M	NURSE	Be good to her, my lord!
M	WESSEX	I will.
M	NURSE	God bless you!
M	WESSEX	Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
M	WESSEX	The tide will not wait. Farewell!
M	MAKEPEACE	Licentiousness is made a show, vice is made a show, vanity and pride likewise made a show! This is the very business of show.
M	FENNYMAN	Is this all right?
M	WABASH	T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike in d-d-d-dignity.
M	WILL	We are lost.
M	HENSLOWE	No, it will turn out well.
M	WILL	How will it?
M	HENSLOWE	I don't know, it's a mystery.
M	WABASH AS THE CHORUS	T-t-t-t-two.
M	WABASH AS THE CHORUS	"...Household both alike in dignity [in fair Verona where we lay our scene] From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife..."
M	WILL	Wonderful!
M	WABASH	W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good?
M	JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON	"Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals."
M	JAMES HEMMINGS AS GREGORY	"No, for then we should be colliers."
M	SAM	Master Shakespeare --
M	WILL	Luck be with you, Sam. Sam...?
M	SAM	It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
M	WILL	Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
M	SAM	"Parting is such sweet sorrow..."
M	HENSLOWE	Another little problem.
M	WILL	What do we do now?
M	HENSLOWE	The show must... you know --
M	WILL	Go on.
M	HENSLOWE	Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
M	WILL	How will it?
M	HENSLOWE	I don't know. It's a mystery.
M	ARMITAGE AS ABRAM	"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
M	JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON	"I do bite my thumb, sir."
M	HENSLOWE	Can we talk?
M	HENSLOWE	We have no Juliet!
M	BURBAGE	No Juliet?!
F	VIOLA	No Juliet?!
M	HENSLOWE	It will be all right, madam.
F	VIOLA	What happened to Sam?
M	HENSLOWE	Who are you?
F	VIOLA	Thomas Kent!
M	HENSLOWE	Do you know it?
F	VIOLA	Every word.
M	PHILIP AS LADY CAPULET	"Nurse, where is my daughter? Call her forth to me."
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old, I bade her come. What, lamb. What ladybird."
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"God forbid. Where's this girl?"
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"What, Juliet!"
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	"How now, who calls?"
M	RALPH AS NURSE	"Your mother."
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	"Madam. I am here, what is your will?
M	BURBAGE	We will all be put in the clink.
M	HENSLOWE	See you in jail.
M	FENNYMAN	"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's Law Is death to any he that utters them." Then him. Then me.
M	ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO	"I am hurt.
M	WILL AS ROMEO	Courage man. The hurt cannot be much.
M	ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO	Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man."
M	ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO	"...Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arms."
M	ACTOR AS BENVOLIO	"Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens are up and Tybalt slain. Stand not amazed. The prince will doom thee death If thou art taken. Hence, be gone away!"
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"I am fortune's fool!"
M	ACTOR AS BENVOLIO	"Why dost thou stay!"
M	WILL	I am fortune's fool.
M	WILL	You are married?
M	WILL	If you be married, my grave is like to be my wedding bed.
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	"Art thou gone so?
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must hear from thee every day in the hour, For in a minute there are many days. O, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo..."
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"...Farewell..."
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	"O think'st thou we shall ever meet again...? Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails, or thou lookest pale."
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"Trust me, love, in my eyes so do you. Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu. Adieu"
M	EDWARD AS FRIAR	"No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death Thou shall continue two and forty hours And then awake as from a pleasant sleep..."
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have a dram of poison --"
M	FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY	"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law is death to any he that utters them!"
M	FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY	"My poverty but not my will consents."
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"I pay thy poverty and not thy will."
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace! and lips, Oh you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death! Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavory guide! Thou desparate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!"
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"Here's to my love O true Apothecary."
M	FENNYMAN	I was good. I was great.
M	WILL AS ROMEO	"Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die."
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	"...Where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo?"
M	NURSE	Dead!
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	"What here? A cup clos'd in my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end."
M	VIOLA AS JULIET	"...O happy dagger This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die."
M	THE PRINCE	"For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."
M	TILNEY	I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!
M	BURBAGE	Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?
M	TILNEY	Everybody! The Admiral's Men, The Chamberlain's Men and everyone of you ne'er-do-wells who stands in contempt of the authority invested in me by her Majesty.
M	BURBAGE	Contempt? You closed the Rose -- I have not opened it.
M	TILNEY	That woman is a woman!
M	ALLEYN	What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?!
M	TILNEY	I'll see you all in the clink! In the name of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.
M	VOICE	Mr. Tilney...!
F	QUEEN	Have a care with my name, you will wear it out.
F	QUEEN	The Queen of England does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint. Come here, Master Kent. Let me look at you.
F	QUEEN	Yes, the illusion is remarkable and your error, Mr. Tilney, easily forgiven, but I know something of a woman in a man's profession, yes, by God, I do know about that. That is enough from you, Master Kent. If only Lord Wessex were here.
M	VOICE	He is, Ma'am.
M	WESSEX	Your Majesty.
F	QUEEN	There was a wager, I remember... as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today. You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
M	WEBSTER	I liked it when she stabbed herself, your Majesty.
F	QUEEN	Master Shakespeare. Next time to you come to Greenwich, come as yourself and we will speak some more.
M	WESSEX	Your Majesty!
F	QUEEN	Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
M	WESSEX	Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
F	QUEEN	As stories must when love's denied -- with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder. Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the playhouse -- go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts. How much was the wager?
M	WESSEX	Fifty shillings. Pounds.
F	QUEEN	Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home.
F	QUEEN	And tell Shakespeare something more cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.
F	QUEEN	Too late, too late.
M	WILL	My Lady Wessex?
F	VIOLA	A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
M	WILL	I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
F	VIOLA	It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
M	WILL	I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
F	VIOLA	If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
F	VIOLA	The Queen commands a comedy, Will, for Twelfth Night.
M	WILL	A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
F	VIOLA	An excellent beginning Let him be... a duke. And your heroine?
M	WILL	Sold in marriage and half way to America.
F	VIOLA	At sea, then -- a voyage to a new world? She lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke... Orsino.
M	WILL	Orsino... good name.
F	VIOLA	But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy --
M	WILL	And thus unable to declare her love.
F	VIOLA	But all ends well.
M	WILL	How does it?
F	VIOLA	I don't know. It's a mystery.
M	WILL	You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
F	VIOLA	Nor you for me.
M	WILL	Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
F	VIOLA	Write me well. My story starts at sea... a perilous voyage to an unknown land... a shipwreck...
M	WILL (V.O.)	...the wild waters roar and heave... the brave vessel is dashed all to pieces, and all the helpless souls within her drowned...
M	WILL (V.O.)	...all save one... a lady...
M	WILL (V.O.)	...whose soul is greater than the ocean... and her spirit stronger than the sea's embrace... not for her watery end, but a new life beginning on a stranger shore.
M	WILL (V.O.)	It will be a love story... for she will be my heroine for all time.
M	WILL	And her name will be... Viola.
M	THE END
