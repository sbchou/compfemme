M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	You keep your work station so clean, Jerome.
M	JEROME	--Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	I reviewed your flight plan. Not one error in a hundred thousand keystrokes. Phenomenal. It's right that someone like you is taking us to the Belt. You have a substance test.
M	LAMAR	Jerome...never shy. Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock. I ever told you that, Jerome?
M	JEROME	Only every time I'm in here.
M	LAMAR	I see a lot of cocks. I speak from experience. Yours is a beautiful example. Why didn't my folks order a cock like that for me?
M	LAMAR	If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while. One week to go. Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
M	JEROME	I'll tell you at the end of the week.
M	JEROME (VO)	The most unremarkable of events. Jerome Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days away from a one-year manned mission to 951 Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt. Nothing so unique in that. Last year over one thousand citizens from every walk of life embarked on some space mission or other. Besides, selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed at birth. He is blessed with all the physical and intellectual gifts required for such an arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second to none.
M	JEROME (VO)	No, there is truly nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I am not Jerome Morrow.
M	JEROME (VO)	I was conceived in the Riviera. Not the French Riviera.
M	JEROME (VO)	The Detroit variety.
M	JEROME (VO)	They used to say that a child conceived in love, has a greater chance of happiness. They don't say that any more.
F	NURSE	What are you doing?
F	MARIA	I can't do this.
F	NURSE	I told you, the government pays. It's all taken care of.
F	MARIA	No, you don't understand. I can't.
F	NURSE	The doctor will give you something.
F	MARIA	I'm not doing it.
F	NURSE	Honey, you've made one mistake--
F	NURSE	--I've read your profile. I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own. You can have other children.
F	MARIA	Not like this one.
F	NURSE	Honey, look around you. The world doesn't want one like that one.
F	MARIA	You don't know what it will be!
F	NURSE	The child won't thank you! Those were early days--days when a priest could still persuade someone to put their faith in God's hands rather than those of the local geneticist.
M	ANTONIO	What's wrong?
M	JEROME (VO)	Of course, there was nothing wrong with me. Not so long ago I would have been considered a perfectly healthy, normal baby. Ten fingers, ten toes. That was all that used to matter. But now my immediate well-being was not the sole concern.
M	JEROME (VO)	My destiny was mapped out before me-- all my flaws, predispositions and susceptibilities - most untreatable to this day. Only minutes old, the date and cause of my death was already known.
F	NURSE	The name? For the certificate.
F	MARIA	Antonio--
M	ANTONIO	--No, Vincent Antonio.
F	MARIA	Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let you out of my sight.
M	JEROME (VO)	I was born Vincent Antonio Luca. And from an early age I came to think of myself as others thought of me - chronically ill. Every skinned knee and runny nose treated as if it were life-threatening.
M	JEROME (VO)	And my parents soon realized that wherever I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me.
M	JEROME (VO)	They put off having any more children until they could afford not to gamble - to bring a child into the world in what has become the "natural" way.
M	JEROME (VO)	It meant selling the beloved Buick.
M	VINCENT (VO)	My father got a good price. After all, the only accident he'd ever had in that car was me.
M	GENETICIST	Put up the dish.
M	GENETICIST	Your extracted eggs... ...Maria, have been fertilized with... Antonio's sperm and we have performed an analysis of the resulting pre-embryos. After screening we're left with two healthy boys and two healthy girls. Naturally, no critical pre-dispositions to any of the major inheritable diseases. All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate.
M	GENETICIST	First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
F	MARIA	We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
M	GENETICIST	You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin. I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
F	MARIA	--We didn't want--diseases, yes.
M	ANTONIO	We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
M	GENETICIST	You want to give your child the best possible start. Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already. Your child doesn't need any additional burdens. And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the best of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
M	ANTONIO	He's right, Maria. That's right.
M	GENETICIST	Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
M	ANTONIO	Er, no...
M	GENETICIST	Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence. Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
M	ANTONIO	I like football.
M	GENETICIST	I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
M	GENETICIST	Anything I've forgotten?
F	MARIA	We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children. We'd like grandchildren.
M	GENETICIST	I understand. That's already been taken care of. Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
F	MARIA	Antonio, the choir...
M	GENETICIST	I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
M	ANTONIO	How much extra?
M	GENETICIST	It would be five thousand more.
M	ANTONIO	I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
M	GENETICIST	Don't worry. You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb. We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
F	MARIA	What will happen to the others?
M	GENETICIST	They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
M	GENETICIST	Smaller than a grain of sand.
M	JEROME (VO)	That's how my brother, Anton, came into the world - a son my father considered worthy of his name.
M	JEROME (VO)	By the time we were playing at blood brothers I understood that there was something very different flowing through my veins.
M	JEROME (VO)	And I'd need an awful lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere.
M	JEROME (VO)	Our favorite game was "chicken". When our parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside the flags, as far out as we dared. It was about who would get scared and turn back first.
M	JEROME (VO)	Of course, it was always me. Anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.
M	JEROME (VO)	My genetic scarlet letter continued to follow me from school to school. When you're told you're prone to learning disabilities, it's sometimes easier not to disappoint anybody.
M	ANTON	How many astronauts are there, anyway?
M	ANTON	I bet I could be one.
M	VINCENT	You're standing on Venus.
M	JEROME (VO)	I was popular enough until it got around that I wasn't a long-term proposition. Those who didn't know already could easily find out for themselves. It was certainly no problem coaxing the information out of me.
M	JEROME (VO)	I didn't blame them. You need to know if a prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage or life insurance or can hold down a decent job.
M	MOTHER	Vincent, you have to be realistic. A heart condition like yours--
M	VINCENT	--I don't care. I'll take the risk.
M	MOTHER	It's not just you they have to be concerned about. Perhaps we could get you one of those new pacemakers. They're not perfect but--
M	FATHER	For God's sake, Vincent, don't you understand. The only way you'll see the inside of a space ship is if you're cleaning it!
M	JEROME (VO)	My father was right. It didn't matter how much I lied on my resum√à, my real C.V. was in my cells. Why should anybody invest all that money to train me, when there are a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile? Of course, it's illegal to discriminate - "genoism" it's called - but no one takes the laws seriously.
M	JEROME (VO)	If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a doorhandle...
M	JEROME (VO)	...or a handshake...
M	JEROME (VO)	...even the saliva off your application form.
M	JEROME (VO)	But for the most part we know who we are. And if all else fails, a legal drug test can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company.
M	JEROME (VO)	I didn't blame Anton for his free ride. You can't blame someone for winning the lottery.
M	ANTON	You sure you want to do this?
M	JEROME (VO)	It was the last time we swam together. Out into the open sea, like always, knowing each stroke towards the horizon was one we had to make back to the shore. Like always, the unspoken contest.
M	ANTONIO	Vincent, you damn fool! You could have killed Anton with your ridiculous contest! Why should he risk his life to save yours?! When are you going to get it through your thick head--you can't compete with your brother! Why try?!
M	ANTON	Why didn't you say anything?
M	VINCENT	Why didn't you? It's okay. It's the way they want it. It confirmed everything in the minds of my parents - that they had taken the right course with my younger brother and the wrong course with me. It would have been so much easier for everyone if I had slipped away that day. I decided to grant them that wish. ethnicities - all members of a genetic underclass that does not
M	JEROME (VO)	Like many others in my situation, I moved around a lot in the next few years, getting work where I could. I must have cleaned half the toilets in the state.
M	CAESAR	When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't clean it too well.
M	VINCENT	What do you mean?
M	CAESAR	You might get ideas.
M	VINCENT	But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier for you to see me when I'm on the other side of it.
M	OWNER	Where's Earl?
M	JEROME	He fell. Lucky it was only the second floor. Of course the best test score in the world wasn't going to get me in the front door unless I had the blood test to go with it.
M	GERMAN	Vincent, I'm German-- That's my name.
M	VINCENT	What do you think?
M	GERMAN	I think I could do something provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
M	GERMAN	You got a photo of yourself?
M	CAESAR	I thought I told you not to get any ideas.
M	GERMAN	Vincent...Vincent...
M	VINCENT	German, is that you?
M	GERMAN	Vincent, come down. I've found him.
M	JEROME (VO)	For the genetically superior, success is easier to attain but is by no means guaranteed. After all, there is no gene for fate. And when, for one reason or another, a member of the elite falls on hard times, their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous. One man's loss is another man's gain.
M	GERMAN	He has the heart of an ox. He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
M	VINCENT	I hope he's not just a body.
M	GERMAN	No problem. Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
M	VINCENT	How do I square the accident?
M	GERMAN	It happened in Australasia. He checked in yesterday. No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck. As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life. Excuse me, your life.
M	VINCENT	Where is he?
M	GERMAN	What did I tell you? Which one's the mirror?
M	VINCENT	That's the hair color in his profile?
M	GERMAN	Yeah.
M	VINCENT	I'd have to bleach my hair.
M	GERMAN	Why are you inventing problems? You two are a couple of goddam clones. You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
M	VINCENT	How tall are you?
M	EUGENE	Four foot six.
M	VINCENT	Okay, how tall did you used to be?
M	EUGENE	Six one.
M	VINCENT	He's too tall.
M	GERMAN	You can wear lifts.
M	VINCENT	Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
M	GERMAN	There's a way.
M	JEROME (VO)	I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued a man who was already dead.
M	VINCENT	You okay, Jerome?
M	EUGENE	Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight?
M	VINCENT	What's wrong with it?
M	EUGENE	I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be you.
M	VINCENT	Suit yourself.
M	EUGENE	Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
M	VINCENT	German.
M	EUGENE	You're both going to a lot of trouble-- Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own. I'm sure you're sincere... ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself. Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it. My point is--how the hell do you expect to pull this off?
M	VINCENT	I don't know exactly, Jerome.
M	EUGENE	At least you're honest. Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
M	JEROME	I have to know where you come from.
M	EUGENE	If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.
M	JEROME	What about this?
M	EUGENE	Wrong color. It's silver. It's not easy living up to this.
M	EUGENE	It needs work.
M	JEROME	You had to be a right-hander.
M	EUGENE	Noone orders southpaws anymore.
M	JEROME (VO)	Myopia is a dead giveaway - one of the earliest and most justifiable of the quality-of-life corrections. Anybody with impaired vision is certain to be suffering from all the other deficiencies of a "nonadvantaged" birth.
M	GERMAN	It's no good. I can see an edge. He may as well walk in there with a cane.
M	EUGENE	You really need that much?
M	JEROME	More than that. You'll get used to it.
M	EUGENE	God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?
M	JEROME	Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home.
M	EUGENE	God, you're serious, aren't you?
M	JEROME	It's not too late to back out.
M	EUGENE	You don't know what a relief it is not to be me. Are you sure you want the job?
M	JEROME	What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
M	EUGENE	Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent.
M	TECHNICIAN	Congratulations.
M	JEROME	What about the interview?
M	TECHNICIAN	That was it.
M	JEROME (VO)	The majority of people are now made-to-order. What began as a means to rid society of inheritable diseases has become a way to design your offspring--the line between health and enhancement blurred forever. Eyes can always be brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body stronger, a life longer. Everyone seeks to give their child the best chance but the most skilled geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.
M	JEROME (VO)	Anyone who is the product of an altered DNA is proudly referred to as a "DAN", "self-made man or woman", "man-child".
M	JEROME (VO)	Those parents who, for moral or, more likely economic reasons, refrain from tampering with their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children to a life of routine discrimination.
M	JEROME (VO)	Officially they are called "In-Valids"*. Also known as "godchildren", "men-of-god", "faith births", "genojunk", "ge-gnomes", "the fucked-up people".
M	JEROME (VO)	They are the "healthy ill". They don't actually have anything yet - they may never. But since few of the pre-conditions can be cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them as if they were already sick.
M	JEROME (VO)	By means of a donor I have cheated the system for the last four years to open doors that would otherwise be closed to me.
M	JEROME (VO)	In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen quickly through the ranks of Gattaca. Only one to discovering my true identity.
M	JEROME (VO)	Strange to think, he may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life.
M	EMPLOYEE 1	Awful.
M	EMPLOYEE 2	Yeah, awful it didn't happen sooner.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	You're lucky to be getting out of this.
M	JEROME	We're still going ahead as planned?
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	The launch window is only open until week's end. Tragic though this event may be, it hasn't stopped the planets turning.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	You'll have to excuse me, Jerome. I have to meet with the authorities--naturally, we're co-operating in any way, although I won't tolerate a major disruption. I wish I was going with you, Jerome.
M	ANNOUNCER (OC)	Thank you for your co-operation. Please return to your work stations immediately.
M	EMPLOYEE 3	What, no counselling?
F	IRENE	Excuse me, Jerome. I'm sorry to bother you.
M	JEROME	No bother.
F	IRENE	I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
M	JEROME	Last night? I was at home.
F	IRENE	Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
M	JEROME	No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.
M	JEROME	Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about you? Where were you last night?
F	IRENE	I was at home.
M	JEROME	Were you alone?
F	IRENE	Yes.
M	JEROME	So we don't know for sure about you, either.
F	IRENE	No.
M	JEROME	Why don't we say we were together?
F	IRENE	Why would we do that?
M	JEROME	I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
M	JEROME	Well, shall we say we spent the evening together?
F	IRENE	To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to know what that was like.
M	EUGENE	You didn't forget the truffles?
M	EUGENE	Who died?
M	JEROME	The Mission Director.
M	EUGENE	You wish.
M	JEROME	They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
M	EUGENE	community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
M	JEROME	He was still warm when they confirmed.
M	EUGENE	This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
M	JEROME	The place is crawling with Hoovers.
M	EUGENE	So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
M	JEROME	That's not the point.
M	EUGENE	Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week-- you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
M	JEROME	You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow.
M	TECHNICIAN	How old?
M	YOUNG WOMAN	Me?
M	TECHNICIAN	The specimen.
M	YOUUNG WOMAN	I kissed him five minutes ago. A real good one.
M	TECHNICIAN	I'll see what I can do.
M	TECHNICIAN	9.4...very nice.
M	MICHAEL	Good evening, gentlemen. Your table is ready. Not long now, sir. You'll be upstairs before you know it. We're going to miss you.
M	JEROME	Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff. I'd like to take one of your chefs with me.
M	WAITRESS	I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
M	EUGENE	Honey, if you'd hurt me, I'd be cured.
M	EUGENE	You want to meet a real-life spaceman?
M	JEROME	Let's get out of here.
M	EUGENE	You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
M	JEROME	You drive.
M	EUGENE	I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!
M	JEROME	Keep going!! Keep going!!
M	EUGENE	You idiot. You could ruin everything with a stunt like that.
M	EUGENE	At least up there your piss will be worth something. You'll all be showering in it, right?
M	JEROME	And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
M	EUGENE	What is that one?
M	JEROME	11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.
M	EUGENE	How long do you stay up there before you go?
M	JEROME	A day or so.
M	EUGENE	I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
M	JEROME	You should be going instead of me.
M	JEROME	Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
M	EUGENE	You know I'm scared of heights.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Let's see what you've got to say for yourself.
M	ASSISTANT	The tongue is male. Mature. Blonse hair. Brown eyes. Light complexion. Between 5'11 and 6'1. Pronounced Caucasian nose. Thin lips. Weak chin. Lobeless ears. Prematurely balding. Slightly bow-legged. Broad shoulders. Barrel chest... Blind.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Blind? The tongue is blind?
M	ASSISTANT	Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man?
M	INVESTIGATOR	Someone who is mindful that the blind still speak.
M	EUGENE	I'm sorry. Did you want it?
M	EUGENE	Let me get it for you.
M	EUGENE	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
M	JEROME	It's okay, Eugene.
M	EUGENE	You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
M	JEROME	--What car?--Go to sleep.
M	EUGENE	--I walked right in front of it. I was never more sober in my life.
M	JEROME	It's all right.
M	EUGENE	I'm proud of you, Vincent.
M	JEROME	You must be drunk to call me Vincent.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir. It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
M	INVESTIGATOR	A man's dead, Detective.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
M	INVESTIGATOR	Grudges?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not... ...universally loved. He was leading the cut-backs in the program. You're looking at a room full of motives.
M	INVESTIGATOR	No, this is your man.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
M	INVESTIGATOR	--What about his profile?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
M	INVESTIGATOR	So there's a 20 percent chance he's not dead.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Even if this Vincent Luca is alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
M	INVESTIGATOR	No. Not likely.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	I take it you're thinking along the lines of a robbery gone sour--a thief disturbed in the act?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found. This was an angry killing.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Who knows with these "deficients"? His profile
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
M	INVESTIGATOR	--I've already run it. There's no record of any living relative.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	What a pity.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found. All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
M	MEDICAL DIRECTOR	Napoleon, you're late for your substance test.
M	JEROME	Director, Napoleon's helping me today.
M	MEDICAL DIRECTOR	Well, you take it for him, Jerome.
M	NAPOLEON	Why did you do that?
M	JEROME	Don't worry about it. cigarette while staring out at the man-made lake. His
F	TRAINER	You're excused, Irene. You may resume your duties.
M	LAMAR	Six miles later it's still beating like a Goddamn metronome. I could play piano by that heartbeat of his.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Director Josef, this is our lead Investigator.
M	INVESTIGATOR	How often do you test, Director?
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Often.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Surely you know what you have.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	We have to be certain. Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
M	LAMAR	I swear if I went to lunch and came back, he'd still be there.
M	INVESTIGATOR	We believe we have a suspect.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	What a relief.
M	INVESTIGATOR	This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	An age enhancement is being prepared as we speak.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Irene will make it available to security.
M	CAESAR	I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow.
M	JEROME	We were looking at each other. You stopped.
F	IRENE	I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.
M	JEROME	We were just looking.
F	IRENE	I know about you.
F	IRENE	Here, take it.
F	IRENE	If you're still interested, let me know.
M	JEROME	Sorry, the wind caught it.
M	JEROME	Have they found our friend?
F	IRENE	Friend?
M	JEROME	It was a mercy-killing after all.
F	IRENE	They found an eyelash.
M	JEROME	Where?
F	IRENE	In the South Wing.
M	JEROME	Does it have a name?
F	IRENE	Just some In-Valid. Vincent-- --somebody.
M	JEROME	Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
F	IRENE	You celebrate, Jerome?
M	EUGENE	--I know what I ordered. I ordered "Honey Dawn" and you sent me "Summer Wheat".
M	JEROME (OC)	Call German.
M	EUGENE	Any particular reason?
M	JEROME	We can't stay here.
M	EUGENE	What are you talking about?
M	JEROME	They think I offed the Director.
M	EUGENE	What makes them think that?
M	JEROME	They found my eyelash.
M	EUGENE	Where?
M	JEROME	In a corridor.
M	EUGENE	Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye.
M	JEROME	Come on--we're taking off.
M	EUGENE	I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
M	JEROME	--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses.
M	EUGENE	Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
M	JEROME	They'll recognize me.
M	EUGENE	How could they recognize you? I don't recognize you. Anyway, you don't have a choice. You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing. This is a minor inconvenience is all it is. We've taken worse heat than this. Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered. You can't quit on me now. I've put too much into this. Besides, this stuff is mine. I had other offers, you know. I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine. You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself? We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
M	EUGENE	And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
M	JEROME	I'm sorry. I think I was crying.
M	EUGENE	Well save those tears.
M	JEROME	You really had other offers?
M	EUGENE	I'm sure I could have.
M	JEROME	Mind if I borrow a tie?
M	EUGENE	So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
M	JEROME	You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
M	EUGENE	Is that all?
M	JEROME	I've got enough on my mind without that.
M	EUGENE	If you say so. The stripe.
M	JEROME	Good choice.
M	JEROME	Not thirsty? We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
M	EUGENE	I don't feel too good. I think I'm still drunk from last night.
M	JEROME	Never stopped you before. And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
M	EUGENE	If I were you I'd worry about myself. Haven't you forgotten something?
M	GERMAN	We still need to overhaul the back-up generator. What's going on, Eugene, I thought he was going away, not you--you going on vacation?
M	EUGENE	You got it, German.
M	GERMAN	You deserve it.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	This is the age enhancement we're working with.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	As you requested, we've kept the parameters wider than usual.
M	INVESTIGATOR	We're in the wrong place. We're wasting time.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	This is the most likely location--
M	INVESTIGATOR	--There's that word again. I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective. Not exactly a slave to probability. Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do you need any more than that?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky.
M	INVESTIGATOR	I don't like anybody this unlucky. Widen the sweep. The West side. Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca. Hoover some of the classier
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
M	INVESTIGATOR	This is a murder investigation. The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
F	IRENE	You didn't know?
M	JEROME	Yes...yes...
F	IRENE	You're angry--
M	JEROME	Why would I be angry? It was beautiful.
M	JOHN	Shit! One of those Hoovers is back.
F	VALERIE	It's alright. He's here to see me.
F	VALERIE	Sonja, I can't see anyone else tonight.
F	VALERIE	I don't understand you, Investigator.
F	VALERIE	You hunt us by day and fuck us by night. Do you only get it up for In-valids?
F	VALERIE	Wouldn't you be happier with one of your made-to-order whores?
M	INVESTIGATOR	You are so beautiful, are you sure you weren't altered? This is not the face, the body, of a Godchild. How could something so lovely be a product of chance?
F	VALERIE	Is that what keeps you coming back? Look at you. Such angry, beautiful, perfect eyes. Do you ever wonder what they would see if they weren't quite so perfect? They will never see what I see.
M	INVESTIGATOR	You have so much wrong with you, you'll be lucky to see next year.
F	VALERIE	Are you so much more alive, Investigator?
M	INVESTIGATOR	I'm not paying you to talk.
M	JEROME	Better not. Don't want to give you a contaminated specimen...if you get my meaning.
M	JEROME	Thanks. You never know where those swabs have been.
F	IRENE	I want to show you something.
F	IRENE	Come on! We'll miss it!
M	JEROME	Come on. We'll miss it.
F	IRENE	What did I tell you?
F	IRENE	I envy you, Jerome.
M	JEROME	You'll be next.
F	IRENE	I don't think so. The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun-- --on this satellite right here.
F	IRENE	--Listen, I don't want to waste your time and I really don't want you to waste mine. I don't know what you're after but I have a feeling I'm not it.
F	IRENE	It's here. My heart. I'm careful--weekly check-ups. I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet-- I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
M	JEROME	What exactly is wrong?
F	IRENE	Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties. But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
F	IRENE	Of course I think about it every day.
M	JEROME	Of course.
M	EUGENE	How was your evening?
M	JEROME	Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.
M	EUGENE	You are a catch. No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up". What's wrong with her?
M	JEROME	You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
M	EUGENE	You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
M	JEROME	Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.
M	EUGENE	She doesn't have to know. She doesn't want to know.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
M	INVESTIGATOR	A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	No. But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	We have to consider the possibility that he's playing somebody else's hand.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Of course. He's a "de-gene-erate". He works at Gattaca. Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom? Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
M	INVESTIGATOR	He was afraid of being exposed. That's why he did it.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. You've seen their security system. They know who works there. Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Don't underestimate these imposters.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
M	INVESTIGATOR	A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you. Intravenous.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	You know their workforce. Two-thirds at least fall into the category. We'll be closing down their operation for days. At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Blood. From the vein.
M	CAESAR	Look like anybody to you?
M	YOUNGER JANITOR	Not to me.
M	CAESAR	Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he?
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	--Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key. Back to the beginning of the book--the life we became. With the original building blocks who knows how far we can take "the godding".
M	MISSION COMMANDER	Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be last year's model by the time we're done.
M	JEROME	I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander.
F	IRENE	Excuse me, Mr Morrow. The investigators have begun their testing.
M	DETECTIVE JOSEF	This is so inconvenient, Irene. They can make an exception for Jerome.
F	IRENE	I'm afraid not.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	I apologize, Jerome.
M	JEROME	It's not yor fault, Director. If your predecessor were still around we may not be going to Gaspra at all. That's what I would call inconvenient.
M	JEROME	What's with the plungers, Lamar? What are you doing, opening a blood bank?
M	LAMAR	The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods may have been compromised.
M	JEROME	Damn!!
M	LAMAR	Jesus--I'm sorry, Jerome.
M	JEROME	You must be out of practise, Lamar.
M	LAMAR	I've got enough here.
M	JEROME	Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
F	IRENE	So you didn't do it after all.
M	JEROME	I guess somebody beat me to it.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	That's the last.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Something's not right.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	He's not here. It's a blind alley.
M	INVESTIGATOR	No, we've missed something. We Hoover again.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	We don't have the manpower.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Get it. From outside, if you have to.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	From what budget?
M	INVESTIGATOR	I'll take it out of your damn pension if you question my authority one more time!
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Would you care to look--in the telescope?
M	INVESTIGATOR	Thank you, no.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
M	INVESTIGATOR	You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Right now, your presence is creating more of a threat. I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be. We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal. So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. shoulders. Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer is amongst us. I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
M	INVESTIGATOR	No, but since there aren't too many live ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep. If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him. I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective. In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
M	INVESTIGATOR	You see, Director, I prefer my microscope.
M	EUGENE	Where are we going?
M	JEROME	I'm sorry. I've got plans.
M	EUGENE	Again?
M	JEROME	She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.
M	EUGENE	I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
M	EUGENE	Where are you taking her?
M	JEROME	Michael's.
M	JEROME	Everybody goes there.
M	EUGENE	You may as well invite her here.
M	JEROME	Will you be okay?
M	EUGENE	Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
M	JEROME	We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
M	EUGENE	How long?
M	JEROME	By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?" Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad. How are you?"
M	EUGENE	I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer. What is this place?
M	JEROME	You've never been here? Let me order for you.
F	IRENE	I'd better not.
M	JEROME	So sure of what you can't do. Do you even know what it tastes like, Irene?
M	MICHAEL	Take the side door.
M	DETECTIVE	Check for lenses, hairpieces--
F	IRENE	Why are we leaving?
M	JEROME	Those checks take forever.
F	IRENE	Jerome!
F	IRENE	What about the car?
M	JEROME	Let's walk.
F	IRENE	Who are they?
M	JEROME	It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here.
F	IRENE	I can't.
M	JEROME	Come on.
F	IRENE	My medication. I left it back there.
M	JEROME	We'll get it later. Irene, please.
M	INVESTIGATOR	You run a clean establishment.
M	MICHAEL	Are you a health inspector?
M	INVESTIGATOR	Do you recognize this man?
M	MICHAEL	My eyes aren't so good.
M	INVESTIGATOR	I bet.
M	HUGO	Sir.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Did he hit you with his fist?
M	DETECTIVE	More like a hammer.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Don't touch your face. Don't swallow. Don't spit. Quick, clean his teeth.
F	IRENE	Are you trying to kill me? Are you?! Don't you understand, I can't do that!
M	JEROME	You just did.
M	INVESTIGATOR (OC)	Vincent! Vincent!
M	INVESTIGATOR	What are you waiting for?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Where do we start?
M	INVESTIGATOR	We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
M	DETECTIVE	We caught them trying to flush these, Sir.
F	IRENE	So sure of what you can't do.
F	IRENE	What happened?
M	JEROME	You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.
F	IRENE	So you're not so smart after all. I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd rather use a donor egg-- --if it came to it.
M	JEROME	But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be?
F	IRENE	You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--what you are? Don't you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
M	JEROME	That's precisely what scaresme--that they won't do anything foolish or courageous or anything--worth a Goddamn.
M	HUGO	My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Why not?
M	HUGO	These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
M	INVESTIGATOR	You worried about the cost?
M	HUGO	Not that.
M	INVESTIGATOR	They said the same thing about myopia and obesity. You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful? Maybe they'd be more human. From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
M	DETECTIVE	Don't touch that. It's evidence.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	Positive saliva match. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
M	INVESTIGATOR	So we have two choices. Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or... ...he is here. We test again. You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act. Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line. I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	Twelve have a mission within the week.
M	INVESTIGATOR	This time I will supervise each test personally.
F	IRENE	What is it?
M	JEROME	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
F	IRENE	I'll miss you.
F	IRENE	--when you go away.
M	JEROME	We could go together one day.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	He's the only absentee.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	A little nausea. Quite common.
M	INVESTIGATOR	At least it's nothing contagious.
M	DIRECTOR JOSEF	I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission. We're already counting backwards.
F	IRENE	I'll call and let him know.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Let's not spoil the surprise. I understand you can show us the way.
M	EUGENE	Hello? How would you like to be yourself for the day?
M	EUGENE	I was never very good at it, remember?
M	INVESTIGATOR	You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?
M	INVESTIGATOR	You think you have problems?
M	EUGENE (OC)	Hello.
F	IRENE	Jerome--?
M	EUGENE	Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.
M	EUGENE	Where's my kiss?
F	IRENE	Good to see you're feeling better.
M	EUGENE	Now you're here. Who are your "friends"?
F	IRENE	It's about the Director.
M	EUGENE	Again?
M	EUGENE	Forgive me for not getting up.
F	IRENE	Couldn't we do this another time?
M	INVESTIGATOR	I don't believe so.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	This won't take a moment.
M	EUGENE	It's okay. Maybe they can find out what I've got.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Mind if I take a leak?
M	EUGENE	As long as you don't do it in my closet. Over there.
M	INVESTIGATOR	May I?
M	EUGENE	Clean the whole house if you want.
F	IRENE	Actually, the kitchen needs doing.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO (OC)	Yes?...Yes...yes...
M	DETECTIVE	Come quickly. We have him.
M	JEROME	How are you, Jerome?
M	EUGENE	Not bad, Jerome.
M	JEROME	How the hell did you get here.
M	EUGENE	I could always walk. I've been faking it.
M	JEROME	Irene.
M	INVESTIGATOR	This can't be him.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night. What more do you want?
M	INVESTIGATOR	Luca could still be an accomplice.
M	MISSION COMMANDER	--Finally, I'd like to welcome Navigator Morrow on his debut mission--if we get lost out there, nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like Jerome.
M	MISSION COMMANDER	I'm gratified that there is no longer a cloud hanging over tomorrow's launch. Now we can put this unpleasantness behind us and concentrate on the task at hand. I don't have to tell you how important this mission is--the Belt could hold the key to the origin of life - why we are what we are. I know many of you have been asking that question about me for long enough. Gaspra--how could something so ugly hold so many beautiful secrets?
M	MISSION COMMANDER	Enjoy your final evening with your families. We'll all be a year older when they see us next. And don't be late tomorrow. You don't want to miss this.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Hugo! I've found him!
M	HUGO	I've found him too.
M	INVESTIGATOR	A fingerprint. There's something to be said for nostalgia. What did you find? not recognize it.
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	It's not exactly him.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Where did you get this?
M	DETECTIVE HUGO	But this man does share some common characteristics with your suspect. Not so many but enough. It appears the eyelash has a brother--of a kind.
M	CAESAR	So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
M	JEROME	Not yet, I'm afraid.
M	CAESAR	No? What's keeping you?
M	JEROME	I guess I'm a slow learner.
M	CAESAR	I guess so. Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
M	JEROME	I'll see what I can do.
M	CAESAR	And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name. You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
M	JEROME	By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
M	CAESAR	I'll take care of it.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Vincent--
M	INVESTIGATOR	Vincent, what are you running from?
M	JEROME	From Vincent.
M	INVESTIGATOR	Has it been so long, you don't remember who I am?
M	JEROME	Maybe it's you who's forgotten. What are you doing here, Anton?
M	ANTON	I could ask you the same question. I have a right to be here, you don't.
M	JEROME	You almost sound like you believe that.
M	ANTON	Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far as you can go.
M	JEROME	There are a few million miles to go yet.
M	ANTON	It's over.
M	JEROME	Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
M	ANTON	It's for the best.
M	JEROME	God, even you want to tell me what I can't do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing. But you did, once.
M	JEROME	Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
M	ANTON	You didn't beat me that day. I beat myself.
M	JEROME	Who are you trying to convince?
M	ANTON	I will prove it to you. Come swim with me now, Vincent. Now--tonight.
F	IRENE	Hello.
M	EUGENE (OC)	Quite something, isn't it?
M	EUGENE	That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
F	IRENE	I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
M	EUGENE	He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
M	EUGENE	Don't be deceived, Irene. These are just the clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
F	IRENE	What's wrong with him?
M	EUGENE	You have more in common than you know.
M	EUGENE	But they say hisis already ten thousand beats overdue. I have my doubts. For all my gifts, they could never engineer me a heart like Vincent's.
M	ANTON	How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done any of this?
M	JEROME	Now is your chance to find out.
M	ANTON	Vincent, where's the shore? We're too far out. We have to go back!
M	JEROME	Too late for that. We're closer to the other side.
M	ANTON	What other side? How far do you want to go?! Do you want to drown us both? How are we going to get back?!
M	JEROME	You wanted to know how I did it. That's how I did it, Anton. I never saved anything for the swim back.
M	JEROME	Here, take it.
M	JEROME	If you're still interested, let me know.
F	IRENE	Sorry, the wind caught it.
M	JEROME	A year is a long time.
F	IRENE	Not so long--just once around the sun.
M	EUGENE	I have your samples ready.
M	JEROME	Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going.
M	EUGENE	No, but you might need them when you get back.
M	EUGENE	Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.
M	EUGENE	There's an extra specimen. I wish I could give it to her myself. But then, you always were better at being me.
M	JEROME	Why have you done this?
M	EUGENE	In case you get back before I do.
M	JEROME	Where are you going?
M	EUGENE	I'm travelling too.
M	JEROME	Thank you.
M	EUGENE	I got the better end of the deal. I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
M	EUGENE	Not until you're upstairs.
M	JEROME	What's this, Lamar?
M	LAMAR	New policy.
M	LAMAR	Flight got you nervous?
M	JEROME	There's a problem, Lamar.
M	LAMAR	Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome? He's a big fan of yours. He wants to apply here.
M	JEROME	Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
M	LAMAR	--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised. But then, who know what he could do.
M	LAMAR	For future reference-- --righthanded men don't hold it with their left. It's just one of those things.
M	LAMAR	Have a safe trip, Vincent.
M	JEROME (VO)	We came from the stars so they say, now it's time to go back. If I was conceived today, I would not get beyond eight cells, and yet here I am. In a way they were right, I don't have the heart for this world. The question is, why am I having so much trouble dying? have completed the Human Genome Project, the mapping of all the genes that make up a human being.
