M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	MR. TURNER	Any word from Doug? The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
F	TRACY	No, but I'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it.
M	TRACY (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	VICK LENNON	He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.
M	VICK	Tracy, it's Vick. Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967 Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.
F	TRACY	Hey Vick!
M	VICK	Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug.
F	TRACY	What?! But we're getting married in like four hours! Vick squints at the rising sun.
M	VICK	Yeah, that's not gonna happen. At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-
M	STU	Dude this is already the best weekend ever!
M	VICK	Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.
M	STU	Oh, did I show you pictures of my kids?!
M	DOUG	No, dude, show `em. Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them
M	STU	Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four! Can you believe it?!
M	DOUG	How cute... Good for you, man. Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.
M	VICK	The one on the left is gonna be a hottie. The other one, not so much. Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:
M	STU	Jesus, dude, those are my children--
M	ALAN	Hey, am I rubbed in? Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over
M	STU	Yeah, you're good.
M	DOUG	Hey so Alan, are you and Becky still together? But before Alan can answer--
M	VICK	Of course they are, Doug. Jesus, Alan's been dating Becky for 14 years. When they first met, Alan had braces and soccer hair, and Becky had a functioning hymen. Asking Alan if he's still with Becky is like asking the sun if it still rises in the east. The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.
M	DOUG	She still pressuring you to get married?
M	ALAN	Enh, we've moved past the pressure stage...it's more like aggravated assault stage now? Like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying. The guys wince, oooo.
M	ALAN (CONT'D)	But we talked, and everything's cool now.
M	STU	Maybe you could wear a helmet to Doug's wedding.
M	ALAN	Great idea, Stu. Thanks. So Vick, how's business going?
M	VICK	Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on bringing the next big dessert craze to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.
M	DOUG	What is it?
M	VICK	Bavarian custard. We ran the numbers, and it's gonna be bigger than fro yo. Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.
M	ALAN	Isn't custard like a trillion calories--? Our plan is to open three stores in the Valley and then franchise it. Shares are selling fast, but I can probably squeeze you guys in...
M	DOUG	Yeah, man, count me in.
M	STU	Me too, man! I love pudding! Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.
M	ALAN	Is this gonna do better than the hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or the topless sushi bar? Or the mobile tattoo parlor--?
M	VICK	Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of it's time, Alan! And don't come crying to me when there's a Custard Cabana on every street corner in America and you didn't buy in--! All right, all right, save it for the party... Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.
M	STU	Dude! I can't believe I get to party all night, and then, tomorrow ...I get to sleep in! It's almost too much! And FYI, if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know, I can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes. No joke. I am a master of stool removal... They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...
M	THE FRONT DESK	A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN waits behind the front desk.
M	FRONT DESK MAN	Welcome to the Mandalay Bay.
M	VICK	Checking in. Lennon comma Victor. The man types into his computer.
M	FRONT DESK MAN	Yes, we have you down for a one night stay in an economy suite-- Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "ATASHIR."
M	VICK	Hold it right there, Atashir. This is my best friend from childhood, Douglas Billings. In two days, he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand? A woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many sons... Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed. My two other childhood friends have travelled great distances, across many deserts, to be here. This isn't a night in a hotel for us, Atashir: this is a family reunion. Perhaps you too have family situated great distances away, in a foreign country with much sand? Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Then I have but one question for you, friend: if they came to town, would you put them in an economy suite?
M	ATASHIR	No, sir.
M	VICK	Well, then. I think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room. Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.
M	ATASHIR	All the deluxe rooms are taken. The Dean Martin suite is available, but I'd have to ask my--
M	VICK	Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case of Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of skinless mangos... Vick turns to the guys:
M	VICK (CONT'D)	You guys want anything? The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen of those duck skewers I like so well. He knows the ones.
M	ATASHIR	And how would you like to pay?
M	VICK	American Express. Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns Dude, give him your AmEx.
M	ALAN	What?
M	VICK	Don't worry, we'll hit you later. Alan stammers.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop being such a Jew. Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.
M	STU	This is bigger than my house. Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.
M	VICK	Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels up in ten. Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan
M	ALAN	I am so not getting paid back.
M	VICK	This is Vick. Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked: He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me! All right, I'll get it. All right. All right--! When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone,
M	VICK (CONT'D)	I said all right, dude! How many more times you want me to say all right?! All right. All right. Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed...
M	ALAN	So, you ready for Sunday?
M	DOUG	Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but I'm actually just really psyched. Alan nods, impressed.
M	ALAN	Tracy's dad still hate you?
M	DOUG	Oh yeah.
M	ALAN	Any closer to figuring out why?
M	DOUG	Enh, I think he wanted more for his girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who makes 45 grand a year, and he's a titan of industry who makes 45 grand a day, you know? I sort of get it... Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm not sure you ever get past that.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	You got floss? Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up,
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	Holy Christ! Alan quickly reaches for the ring--
M	ALAN	Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell anyone about that-- Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE
M	STU	Anyone got any nipple lube--? Jesus would you look at the size of that thing?! Stu grabs the ring from Doug.
M	DOUG	It's Alan's. For Becky.
M	STU	Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?
M	ALAN	Actually, I-I was trying to keep it a secret, so-- Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:
M	VICK	Boy Party in the bathrooooom--! Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K. Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples.
M	STU	Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's finally going to propose!
M	VICK	Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you! Where'd you get the ring?
M	ALAN	Oh, it's a family heirloom. My grandmother smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually. I was going to propose to Beck this weekend. Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him.
M	DOUG	Well: now we have two things to celebrate!
M	STU	Thish is so great! I love you guys!
M	VICK	Check it out, Stu's already wasted. Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.
M	ALAN	We've only had two shots, man!
M	DOUG	Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You used to be able to drink us all under the table!
M	STU	Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time to get plastered anymore! It blows! Am I a bad dad for saying that? What? No!
M	STU	Because my dad was a bad dad.
M	DOUG	That's true, Stuey, but you're different. We've talked about this. Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.
M	STU	Have I showed you guys pictures of my kids yet--?
M	YES!	Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:
M	DOUG	Little toast: to Tracy, the coolest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever met. I can't believe she let me come this weekend -- much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me. I think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part. The guys chuckle, hear-hear. And to being here, with my best friends in the world. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. The guys raise their glasses, touched.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? I'm getting married in 36 hours.
M	ALAN & STU & VICK	No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally, dude. Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.
M	DOUG	I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above the neck -- no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos. I gotta look decent on Sunday.
M	VICK	Jesus, what do you take us for?
M	DOUG	Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows off the night before graduation!
M	STU	Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And remember when I blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker?! That was awesome! What'd you write again?
M	ALAN & DOUG & VICK	"Respect me!" They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic.
M	STU	Ahh, good times, man. Good times...
M	VICK	We'll be good tonight, Doug.
M	ALAN	Seriously, man, we're your friends.
M	STU	Yeah, we've totally grown up since then. Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.
M	DOUG	Well then...to a night we'll never forget. They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and
M	THE NEXT MORNING	Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into
M	THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE	THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it
M	PILE OF NEWSPAPERS	OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus! Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find
M	VICK	Damn, dude, why are you retarded? Both men are ragingly hungover. A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Um, Stuey?
M	STU	Yo.
M	VICK	Why do you have a mullet? Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too
M	STU	What?
M	VICK	You know, business on top, party down the back? Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Your hair, dude. You have a mullet. Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom. Dude...I have a mullet. Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:
M	ALAN (O.S.)	Just give me ten more minutes, Beck... Whoa, did you sleep in the tub? Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom. Check it out: Alan slept in the tub.
M	VICK	Get him up. I'm hungry. Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?! There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat. Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night
M	VICK	Jesus, dude, put away your sack. Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.
M	STU	Yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping, bro. Your bush looks like Yanni. Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.
M	ALAN	What did we do last night?
M	STU	Dude, why is my ass killing me...?
M	MAN	We'll...we'll get the next one. The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.
M	VICK	We might not smell very good. The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.
M	STU	This might be the worst hangover anyone has ever had, ever.
M	ALAN	I can't taste anything.
M	VICK	Please stop talking. If I don't focus on eating I'm going to throw up all over myself. The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:
M	ALAN	Hey... Are we missing something? The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:
M	STU	Yes: I left my hat in the room -- thank you, Alan. They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.
M	ALAN	No. That's not it... There's something else... Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.
M	VICK	You gonna finish that cruller? Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his
M	ALAN	Doug. Guys, where's Doug? The guys look around. Hunh.
M	STU	Yeah. He's not here.
M	VICK	Probably left him in the room. Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	I'll call his cell. Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:
M	STU	Good morning, this is Stu?
M	VICK	It's me, meatdick.
M	STU	It's Vick-- Then Stu realizes. Oh. This is Doug's phone. Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.
M	ALAN	You calling the room? Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then
M	VICK	No answer. Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.
M	ALAN	Ummm...shouldn't we look for him? Check-out is in like ten minutes.
M	STU	Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have Doug back to LA by five. Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:
M	VICK	I'm eabing.
M	ALAN	What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the casino, I'll check the room and the gym. Maybe he's working out or something... Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.
M	ALAN (CONT'D)	And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the buffet, that'd be really helpful. Thanks, man. Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:
M	ALAN	Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man. Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes
M	THE BED IS MISSING	There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.
M	ALAN	That's weird...
M	STU	No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's totally cool...
M	ALAN	I hate you all... Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.
M	GAY MAN	Hey Stu.
M	STU	Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--! Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns He slowly bow-legs himself over.
M	STU	You find Doug?
M	ALAN	No, I assume you didn't either? Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.
M	ATASHIR	There is no Doug Billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations. The guys frown, starting to grow worried.
M	STU	Maybe he went for a jog?
M	ALAN	Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.
M	STU	Or shopping? The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.
M	ALAN	Great. So we've officially lost Doug. His wedding is in what, 22 hours?
M	VICK	Relax, it's Doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. All we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him.
M	ALAN	Okay, so last night... The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.
M	VICK	Well, we started on the roof...
M	ALAN	Right, that was like, 6ish...?
M	VICK	Then...I think...we had steaks at the Palm?
M	ALAN	Yeah. Then...we played craps at the Hard Rock...maybe?
M	VICK	That sounds right... Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.
M	STU	Okay, honestly? I don't even remember going to dinner.
M	VICK	I vaguely recall...doing body shots ....at some point? Is that...maybe?
M	ALAN	I'm pretty much blank after The Hard Rock.
M	VICK	I think we went to the Flamingo after that...? And then, I just remember a lot of blue light...and the overpowering smell of baby oil.
M	ALAN	So that was what, 10ish?
M	VICK	Give or take.
M	STU	Was Doug still with us? Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.
M	VICK	Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I tackled him...for some reason. The guys nod, okay, okay.
M	ALAN	Okay. So we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him. They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets,
M	STU	Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo. A long beat of silence... Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start
M	ALAN	ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37-- For 600 dollars?!
M	VICK	The valet ticket says we returned here at 4:57AM.
M	STU	We drove last night? The guys wince, jesus...
M	ALAN	Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The meal was comped for some reason--
M	VICK	Why do we have a matchbook from The Golden Pony All Male Revue? The guys exchange a look, alarmed.
M	ALAN	Someone could've given that to us.
M	STU	Yeah, totally! There's no way we went there! We're not gay! Hahaha! They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the
M	ALAN	I think we should call Tracy.
M	VICK	Absolutely not.
M	ALAN	What if Doug called her? She might know where he is. Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.
M	STU	Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.
M	VICK	Of course you're with Alan, you're both gutless cowards. But we're not calling Tracy. You never call the bride from the bachelor party. Ever. If my balls were on fire and Tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water, I still wouldn't call her. It's a rule.
M	ALAN	But shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late?
M	VICK	She has a watch, she'll figure it out.
M	ALAN	I think I'm beginning to see why you're always single.
M	VICK	And I think I'm beginning to see why you're always a douche--
M	STU	Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh my God -- like right now. Come on. Jesus, what is it?
M	VICK	I can't believe we're doing this.
M	STU	You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong... Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.
M	ALAN	Sweet mother of mercy...
M	VICK	Who's Roger?
M	STU	I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?!
M	VICK	What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude -- I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man! Stu covers his mouth, horrified!
M	ALAN	I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this...
M	STU	Really?! What?! Alan tries to think of one.
M	ALAN	Yeah, maybe there isn't.
M	VICK	Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man--
M	STU	Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!
M	VICK	Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough.
M	STU	I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids!
M	ALAN	Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay.
M	VICK	But sort of...it does? Stu grows increasingly frantic.
M	STU	And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham!
M	ALAN	So what, he's a great-looking dude--
M	STU	And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?! Everyone stops. Vick most of all.
M	VICK	Um, what?
M	STU	Yeah, that weekend we were all camping -- I told you this.
M	VICK	Yeah, no you didn't.
M	STU	I didn't?
M	VICK	I think I'd remember, dude.
M	ALAN	Yeah, I think we'd all remember.
M	STU	Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away. Vick is just looking at him, stunned.
M	ALAN	Wait -- I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me?
M	VICK	Unbelievable.
M	ALAN	What?! I was a good-looking kid!
M	VICK	Please, you're so not his type!
M	STU	Wait, what? Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room
M	VICK	Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay? A lot of guys test the waters. ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.
M	ALAN	All right, we're scaring the children. Let's go. The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.
M	STU	Wait -- so have either of you tested the waters?
M	VICK	No! We're not gay! Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto
M	THE CASINO FLOOR	The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit.
M	STU	How am I going to tell my wife?
M	VICK	Quickly, and from a great distance.
M	STU	Jesus, what kind of father am I? Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time
M	ALAN	Oh my God.
M	STU	You think Erin will try to take the kids--?
M	ALAN	Oh...my...God.
M	VICK	What now? Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger
M	STU	Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna have a field day with this. Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and
M	VICK	Oh my God... Oh my God...
M	STU	What's the big--? Oh! OH! OH! Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily
M	STU (CONT'D)	Maybe it's not a wedding ring?
M	ALAN	"To My Noble Husband, Alan." The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!
M	STU	This is worse than my underwear! Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:
M	VICK	"Now & Forever Wedding Chapel." They guys exchange a look.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Well, at least it's a lead. Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot
M	VICK	So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we're back in LA before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass. No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.
M	STU	Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the window last night. Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel
M	ALAN	That was us, dude.
M	STU	Really?
M	ALAN	Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's room. Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good reason for doing it. You think they'll charge us for--?
M	ALAN	Yeah, Stu, I really do.
M	VICK	Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be cool... Just then the Valet drives up in
M	VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC	The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-
M	STU	You okay, Vick?
M	VICK	I'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you. Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car... in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS,
M	ALAN	Seriously: what am I gonna tell Becky? For 14 years she's been begging me to get married...
M	VICK	Well, now you did. Just not to her. Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--
M	ALAN	Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt? The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk
M	STU	Naaah.
M	VICK	Yeah, that was a different shirt. Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Left turn. Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so
M	ALAN	What if they don't remember us--? The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE
M	STEVE	How are you, you dumb bastards?! He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it
M	ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!	You here to pick up your wedding photos?! Alan starts to decline, when--
M	VICK	Does the pope wear a funny hat?! Let's do this thing! Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.
M	STEVE	And where is Chastity today? They all sit on white plastic chairs.
M	ALAN	W-Who's...Chastity? Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just breaking my balls! Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts
M	VICK	Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it?
M	STEVE	Hand to God, I've never seen two people more in love!
M	VICK	Sadly, I believe you... The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night Hello, Chastity... Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.
M	ALAN	I am never...ever...drinking again.
M	STU	Jesus, she is stacked.
M	VICK	Stu, please, show some class. That's Alan's wife you're talking about.
M	STU	Sorry. She looks really nice. But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and
M	ALAN	We got a unicorn?!
M	STEVE	Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double Camelot Package. Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.
M	ALAN	A-And how much did that cost?
M	STEVE	7 thousand dollars. Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!
M	STEVE (CONT'D)	Yeah, you didn't want to get it, either, but Vick insisted. Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!
M	ALAN	I'm gonna kill you!
M	VICK	You can't put a pricetag on love, Alan! OW! You just can't! The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA,
M	CARLA	Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts! She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.
M	CARLA (CONT'D)	Good to see you, you stupid mooks! Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick,
M	VICK	It's good to be seen, Carla. It's good to be seen.
M	CARLA	I brought the rest of your package. Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.
M	CARLA (CONT'D)	First: Two dozen commuter mugs... She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo
M	STU	No way! Awesome!
M	STEVE	A hundred DVDs of the ceremony... She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:
M	VICK	For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary... Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.
M	CARLA	The velvet wall hanging... She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of
M	VICK	And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no machine wash, okay?
M	CARLA	And the big finish: Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...
M	STU	I want a shield!
M	VICK	Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a shield?
M	ALAN	I don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you?
M	STEVE	Um...if you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys, and who want two dozen commuter mugs, a wall hanging, and a shield...sure. Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it
M	ALAN	What. We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.
M	ALAN (CONT'D)	Oh, hey Becky! Hi! He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:
M	VICK	That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a minute...
M	BECKY	in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase.
M	BECKY	Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out?!
M	ALAN	No! I-I have no idea--! Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:
M	WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!	Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard.
M	BECKY	"Your best man?!" What's going on there, Alan?!
M	ALAN	Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS
M	BOGART A FEW?!	Alan furiously flips them off, shut up!
M	BECKY	I really don't appreciate being mocked right now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues. You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me.
M	ALAN	I know, baby! I know--
M	BECKY	So you'll call the credit card company and straighten this out?
M	ALAN	Yes. I will. I promise.
M	BECKY	Okay. Okay... Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll see you soon, okay? Love you. But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making
M	BECKY (CONT'D)	Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!
M	ALAN	Yes, no, I love you too! Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable.
M	STU	Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!
M	VICK	Yeah, did she ask about us?! Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we
M	STU	Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue.
M	VICK	Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm. That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that great?
M	ALAN	Amazing.
M	VICK	Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you?
M	STEVE	Well, the Double Camelot Package comes with a five course wedding feast, so I assume you went there.
M	STU	Great -- where was the feast?
M	STEVE	Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.
M	ALAN (V.O.)	I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!
M	VICK	Your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, Alan. You've got to let go of this.
M	ALAN	Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The fact that I married a complete stranger last night? Or that my girlfriend's about to leave me? Or that I'm broke? Which one?!
M	VICK	You're broke? I thought you were
M	ALAN	I know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky, okay? I-I honestly don't know what I'd do without her...I really don't... Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short.
M	VICK	Alan. Honey. Have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do?
M	ALAN	Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, Vick, I've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity!
M	STU	I ain't mad atcha, dude...
M	VICK	Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you.
M	ALAN	I was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass!
M	VICK	All the more reason to freak out. Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick
M	VICK (CONT'D)	I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but you've always had a major pole up your ass. Maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out-
M	ALAN	I swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word to me, I will destroy you.
M	STU	Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words-- A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump!
M	VICK	What the--?! They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian
M	KALOLO FANALUA	Get out of the car, Vick. Stu and Alan recoil in terror.
M	STU	Who are these guys?!
M	VICK	Stu, please. I think there's been some sort of mistake, Mister...?
M	KALOLO FANALUA	I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get The Hell Outta The Car, and this is my associate, Mr. Smash You In The Teeth If You Say Another Word.
M	VICK	Those so aren't their real names.
M	ALAN	Vick, don't be a dick--!
M	VICK	Alan? Relax. These men aren't going to hurt us. They're from Hawaii. Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car!
M	KALOLO FANALUA	We're from Guam, bitch! Now get outta the car!
M	VICK	Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car...? Vick undoes his seatbelt and reaches for his door handle.
M	ALAN	Why'd you do that?! Really?
M	STU	Maybe they just wanted to talk!
M	VICK	I honestly don't know how you two are still alive.
M	ALAN	Do you think we stole something from them last night?!
M	STU	Oh my god I am such a bad dad!
M	ALAN	I'm calling the police. This is getting way out of control--
M	VICK	No! No cops!
M	ALAN	"No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty Cent?!
M	STU	Yeah, Vick, what's going on?
M	VICK	Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing!
M	ALAN	Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza!
M	VICK	Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip.
M	ALAN	They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too!
M	STU	If anything ever happened to my family, Vick...
M	VICK	Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn. Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan
M	VICK	Doug? Doug? Alan quickly checks the room phone.
M	ALAN	No messages.
M	STU	Come on, let's toss the place. Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while
M	STU	Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last night! Vick calls from the other bedroom.
M	VICK (O.S.)	Smart move, man. Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.
M	STU	Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?! Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the
M	VICK	Whoa.
M	STU	You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted?
M	VICK	No. I think she's Alan's wife. Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet-
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy? A second later Alan enters, what's up?
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan. Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor, What...what am I supposed to do?
M	STU	Wake her up, man!
M	ALAN	Why me?!
M	VICK	Because she's your spouse, dude! Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared,
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Pinch her tit. It always works. Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets
M	CHASTITY	Dang, did I sleep in the closet again...? Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles,
M	CHASTITY (CONT'D)	Oh hey, guys! What's up? She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a
M	CHASTITY (CONT'D)	Morning, honey... She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie.
M	STU	She seems really cool.
M	VICK	Yeah, I really like her, man.
M	VICK	So, um, did you take Alan's name?
M	STU	Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish now--?
M	ALAN	Listen to me. Just...did we, or did we not, have sex last night? Alan braces, please say no, please say no... Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...
M	CHASTITY	Well...ya? Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!
M	CHASTITY (CONT'D)	But we waited til we were married. Alan GROANS.
M	VICK	What a responsible, upstanding young Jew. They don't make `em like that anymore, am I right? Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.
M	CHASTITY	I know -- he even wanted to use a rubber. Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.
M	ALAN	Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!
M	CHASTITY	It's cool, I sponge. Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.
M	ALAN	Can someone...please open a window?
M	STU	They don't open.
M	CHASTITY	So you guys don't remember any of last night?
M	VICK	Yeah, not so much.
M	CHASTITY	Hey, been there before, right? Sucks, though. The wedding was really fun. I'm bummed you don't remember it, Alan. She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:
M	STU	Dude, I think your wife's mad at you.
M	VICK	You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you?
M	CHASTITY	Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00? Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00?
M	VICK	It's the All-American love story, isn't it? What happened next?
M	CHASTITY	Well, I had to go back to work. But when I got off at 5:30, I met up with you guys back here.
M	VICK	And was Doug with us then?
M	CHASTITY	No.
M	VICK	Interesting... Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding?
M	CHASTITY	No, but I bet some of my work friends do. You were partying with them pretty hard.
M	STU	Work friends?
M	STRIPPERS	Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles.
M	ALAN	You work here? Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.
M	CHASTITY	Yeah -- and this is the pole where we first met! She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER
M	CHASTITY (CONT'D)	It's always been my lucky pole...
M	ALAN	Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but-- She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING
M	PLATINUM THE STRIPPER	Get it, girl!
M	CHASTITY	Come on, let's go meet my bridesmaids! She hurries off, but Alan can't move.
M	STU	Dude.
M	VICK	I know.
M	ALAN	The Holocaust, man. Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.
M	VICK	Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back. We just gotta go about it in the right way.
M	ALAN	I have besmirched my people.
M	STU	Don't be so hard on yourself, dude-- Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.
M	CHASTITY	These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and Starr!
M	STARR	Hey, boys! Good to see you again!
M	ANASTASIA	Mazel Tov--!
M	ALAN	Please...don't. Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY The DJ puts on Nine Inch Nails' "I Want to Fuck You Like An
M	CHASTITY	Oh my God, he's playing our song! This song was playing when we met, remember?! You kept sliding twenties into my thong and saying "I will always love you. I will always love you." Alan closes his eyes.
M	ALAN	Twenties?
M	CHASTITY	Yeah, it was so sweet...
M	ALAN	Look, I don't know how to say this, but my friends and I were very drunk last night. We would never He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone.
M	ALAN (CONT'D)	Guys?
M	THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM	getting lapdances from STARR and ANASTASIA. The Champagne
M	VICK	You are the best bridesmaids ever.
M	STU	Dude: I might not be gay. Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed. What the hell are you doing?!
M	VICK	Two-for-ones, man.
M	ALAN	We don't have time for this! We gotta find Doug!
M	VICK	What do you think we're doing?
M	ALAN	What?
M	VICK	We're getting into the mindset of last night, to see if it sparks any memories. Now: is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night, Starr? She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Yeah, still no memories. Keep going -- and put your back into it.
M	ALAN	You are so goddamn selfish, Vick. You really are. Stu, let's go.
M	VICK	No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance. Stu looks between them, torn.
M	ALAN	Dude: Doug is missing! We have less than 18 hours til his wedding! We do not have time for this!
M	VICK	I'm trying to save your life here, Alan Mervish.
M	ALAN	Vick--!
M	VICK	I'm not kidding, man! Life is one long series of emergencies, and if you don't learn to stop and have a little fun along the way, you're gonna grow into a joyless old prick like your dad. I'm sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it, but it had to be said. Now yes, we have 18 hours to find Doug -- which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body-artists. So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life. Chastity, honey? When you're ready? Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and
M	ALAN	No, look-- I am like totally against this, morally and politically. Plus Becky specifically asked me not to--
M	STU	I think I know why he married her.
M	VICK	Because if he hadn't, I would've. They continue watching on in silence.
M	STU	Is it weird that we're sitting this close watching?
M	VICK	Not for me. More watching in silence.
M	STU	I really shouldn't be here. I have daughters. Then both of their heads angle the same way.
M	VICK	Not that can do that.
M	STU	How can she do that without dislocating her hip?
M	VICK	Because she's been touched by God. They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Shit. They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!
M	ALAN	Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses-- Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.
M	VICK	Come on, man! We got company! Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here?! Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to
M	CHASTITY	Come on! The guys race after her... Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu
M	CHASTITY	Come on! Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main
M	STU	Did she just do that in heels?!
M	VICK	I'm really starting to like this girl. The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of
M	THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS	
M	CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD	Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder, we've subdued the targets, over.
M	STU	Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen?! I think they killed like four of them! Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.
M	VICK	Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't just a little fun...
M	ALAN	That was...a little fun. Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb,
M	LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN	Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?! Stuart Pryce?! Y-Yes?!
M	LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN	You're coming with us.
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	Where were you last night at 3am?
M	VICK	No idea.
M	OFFICER BLADEN	Okay, how about at 2am?
M	VICK	Ditto. Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	You think this is cute, son?! You think this is a game?!
M	ALAN	Whatever we did, we're so sorry!
M	STU	Honestly, man, I will confess to anything you want!
M	VICK	Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up straight. Officer Merriweather, I've told you twelve times now: we have no memory of last night. Now either charge us with a crime, or let us go. Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	What do you know about Jimmy Lang? Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something.
M	ALAN	Nothing?
M	STU	Who is he?
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang- Xi crime organization, and is wanted in seven states for money laundering, drug smuggling, racketeering and murder.
M	ALAN	Oh my god--
M	STU	Did we kill someone last night--?!
M	VICK	We have no idea who this man is.
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	Is that right?
M	VICK	Yeah, that's right. ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a Birthday To You." When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him Everyone applauds. Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.
M	VICK (ON TAPE)	I love you, Jimmy Lang! Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen.
M	STU	We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we.
M	ALAN	Officers, I swear, we have no memory of that ever occurring--
M	OFFICER BLADEN	Okay. Maybe a night in jail will jostle something loose.
M	STU	Oh no, sir, please don't!
M	ALAN	We have a very important wedding--!
M	VICK	I know Jimmy Lang. Everyone stops, looks at Vick.
M	ALAN	You do?!
M	VICK	Jimmy and I tried to raise capital for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween-age girls, but it never got off the ground. It was an entirely legitimate enterprise -- I had no idea he was a criminal. We must've bumped into him last night, and he must've invited us to join his birthday celebration. No crime in that, is there, Officers? Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense.
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	You actually expect me to believe that dung? Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	If I find out you're lying to me, son, I will take all of you down, is that clear?
M	OFFICER BLADEN	You boys wouldn't last three hours in prison.
M	VICK	Stu might. Stu shakes his head, unbelievable. Now: are you gonna charge us with something, or are we free to go? The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat.
M	OFFICER BLADEN	Get outta here. Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door.
M	ALAN	Oh, thank you, Officers!
M	STU	It was really nice meeting you--!
M	OFFICER MERRIWEATHER	If you know what's good for you, you'll get the hell out of Vegas.
M	ALAN	Did you have to be such a dick?!
M	VICK	We got out, didn't we?
M	ALAN	Yeah, four hours later! If we'd just cooperated with them--
M	VICK	If we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, Alan. They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab. What are we gonna do now? We've got zero leads on where Doug is!
M	STU	Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30. The guys shake their heads, I don't know. Do you think he's okay--?
M	VICK	Stu, don't. Doug is fine.
M	STU	I mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man! They kill people for looking at `em weird--!
M	VICK	Stu: Doug is fine.
M	STU	Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank--?!
M	VICK	Stu! Enough! I knew I shouldn't have come...
M	VICK	What did you just say?
M	ALAN	I said I knew I shouldn't have come this weekend, Vick!
M	VICK	Is that right?
M	ALAN	Yeah, that's right. I only came because Doug insisted. Vick steps towards Alan, heated.
M	VICK	Why do think you're so much better than us, dude?!
M	ALAN	I don't -- I just think I'm better than you, Vick! And trust me, it's not that hard! You haven't changed one bit since high school! Jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops?! Really?!
M	VICK	You're out of your depth, Alan--
M	ALAN	And you're still the one getting us in trouble! Only then it was hiding your weed in our locker, and now you've got us partying with wanted felons! It's not cute anymore, man! We're too old for this! Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...
M	ALAN (CONT'D)	And all your stupid get-rich-quick schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?! In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!
M	STU	Okay, let's all take a breath--
M	ALAN	When's the last time you had a real job, man?! When's the last time you had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the last time you picked up the check?!
M	VICK	What's so great about any of those things?!
M	ALAN	Those "things," Vick, are what grown men do! Vick swallows, furious.
M	STU	Look, we're all tired and hungry--
M	VICK	None of us ever liked you, Alan! We only hung out with you because Doug made us! Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.
M	ALAN	Stu...? Is that true? Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I
M	VICK	Why would anyone like you, dude? Have you ever thought about that? You're uptight, you're judgemental, you're cheap, and yet somehow you think you're sweeter than everyone else! Well look around, man: no one wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu than you!
M	STU	Wait, what--? Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn!
M	ALAN	I've...always...hated you...
M	VICK	You punch like...your sister... Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.
M	STU	Hey, no! Time out! We all need a time out--! THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down.
M	A CAR HORN SOUNDS	And all three of them look up to see Vick'S BEAT-UP CADILLAC
M	CHASTITY	That might not be like, the smartest place to fight? Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE
M	STU	Good call on happy hour, Chastity. These tacos kick ass.
M	CHASTITY	Yeah, I always come here when I get out of jail. The guys exchange a quick look.
M	ALAN	Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?
M	CHASTITY	Oh, my daddy taught me how to hotwire almost anything.
M	VICK	That's funny, because Alan's daddy taught him tax law. Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:
M	ALAN	And Vick's daddy taught him how to get really drunk at his kid's soccer games and then piss himself.
M	VICK	It's a disease, dude--!
M	STU	Guys, come on! For Doug? Alan and Vick angrily continue eating their tacos. Then Stu's
M	STU (CONT'D)	"Number blocked."
M	VINCE ALAN	Don't answer it. Answer it.
M	ALAN	What if it's Doug?
M	VICK	What if it's Tracy?!
M	STU	Good evening, this is Stu!
F	TRACY	Stu, it's Tracy! His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses:
M	STU	It's Tracy! Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit.
M	STU (CONT'D)	Why is she calling me?!
M	VICK	Because she knows you're the most easily tricked.
M	ALAN	We have tell her we lost Doug.
M	VICK	No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu! Stu turns back to the phone, rattled.
M	STU	Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?
F	TRACY	Oh, nothing, just here with my family...
M	STU	Wow, that sounds amazing!
F	TRACY	Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen to know where Doug is, would you? He said he'd be home by 5 for this dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I tried his cell, but he didn't answer...
M	STU	Ummmm........Hang on. She wants to know where Doug is!
M	VICK	I'm working on it! Buy us some time!
M	ALAN	No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always the best policy!
M	VICK	What are you, retarded?! Honesty is never the best policy! Especially not with brides!
M	STU	Um, what'd you say? I asked if you knew where Doug was.
M	STU	Yeah, um, hang on. She still wants to know!
M	VICK	Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours, but that we'll be back in time for the wedding.
M	ALAN	Why do I have to be the one that fell over drunk?!
M	VICK	It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get over yourself! Stu: tell her!
M	STU (TO PHONE)	Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a
M	VICK	Fell over drunk.
M	STU	H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a different doctor, not the one he fell on -- he said we couldn't move him until the wedding--
M	VICK	For a few hours! We'll be home before the wedding!
M	STU	But we're going to have the wedding at your home-- Tracy just looks really confused. Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu.
M	VICK	Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?
F	TRACY	Vick, what is going on?
M	VICK	Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay?
F	TRACY	Oh God, is Alan all right?
M	VICK	Yes, luckily he had a steel rod surgically implanted up his ass at birth, so the doctors anticipate a complete and swift recovery. Alan flips him the bird.
F	TRACY	Can I talk to Doug?
M	VICK	What? No! No, you can't actually, Doug...Doug is out.
F	TRACY	Where is he?
M	VICK	Where is he? He's aaaat...the pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's medications. Listen, Trace, I'm losing you, but we'll see you tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--! Vick hangs up and nods confidently. She bought it.
F	TRACY	They've done something stupid. Her stern father is standing there, frowning.
M	MR. TURNER	No surprise there.
M	MR. TURNER	I'm just saying, what kind of man stands up his fiancée the night before their wedding?
F	TRACY	Dad, I don't want to hear it. I trust Doug absolutely. Mr. Turner backs off. Tracy, however, looks a bit rattled...
M	ALAN	Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd have Doug home in 13 hours, and we still have no idea where he is... They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a
M	DOORMAN	Handstamp for re-entry? Handstamp for re-entry? Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why
M	VICK	Maybe we should go back to the hotel and--
M	STU	Oh my God, guys! Look! Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV
M	ALAN	It's like a map of last night! The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!
M	STU	Where do you want to start?!
M	VICK	At the top! We hit every club we went to til someone remembers what we did with Doug!
M	ALAN	Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe we're actually gonna pull this off! Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.
M	STU	Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's hat?! The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car
M	VICK	Naaah, couldn't be.
M	ALAN	Lots of people have hats like that. Stu nods, yeah, I guess... The first bar written on it is "GhostBar."
M	STU	All right, this is the last place we went, "Chaps." Vick rolls to a stop in front of...
M	CHAPS NIGHTCLUB	It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in
M	STU	You sure we came here...? Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF
M	ALAN	The Golden Pony. That's us.
M	STU	Maybe I'll just wait in the car-- But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.
M	VICK	You think we would've remembered this...
M	STU	Yeah, I don't think we came here...
M	ALAN	Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall? The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed
M	STU	Those could be anybody's. Thousands of people go to Colorado State--
M	ALAN	Oh my God, are they autographed? "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I Chaps!"
M	STU	I am so gay... Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.
M	WAITER	Hey, guys! Roger is backstage! The guys look at each other, eyes wide.
M	STU	R-Roger?
M	ALAN	Stay very close to me. She smiles and dances through the crowd.
M	BOUNCER	How are Haylee and Kaitlin?
M	STU	Oh. G-Good, thanks...?
M	VICK	We're going to love you either way, Stu... Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.
M	ALAN	Some of my best friends are gay.
M	STU	Is that true?
M	ALAN	Not...not really? I live in Connecticut, man, we don't even have black people yet. Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters... Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake,
M	VICK	Excuse me, friend, can you tell me where Roger is?
M	BEEFCAKE COWBOY	Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there. He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky
M	VICK	He's cute...I guess...? Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees
M	ROGER	Oh! Hey guys! He hugs all of them. The guys make sure to keep their asses
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	I'm surprised you're even walking yet, Stu.
M	STU	Oh my god.
M	VICK	Listen, man, we don't really remember what happened last night, can you fill us in?
M	ROGER	Really? No memory? Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared...
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little hurt.
M	STU	Did we...you know...do anything?
M	ROGER	Well, duh? Yeah? The guys all freeze. A beat. Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder,
M	STU	Was I...the boy or the girl?
M	ROGER	Oh, honey, you were everything. Stu WHIMPERS. Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit!
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	But you were nothing like Vick.
M	VICK	Wait-- what?!
M	ROGER	I know, I'm sort of over group stuff too, but Alan insisted. Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned.
M	VICK	You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!
M	ALAN	I don't know! I don't know why I insisted!
M	ROGER	Actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender. The guys look at each other, nauseous.
M	STU	I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore... Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.
M	CHASTITY	Guys: he's kidding. Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The
M	VICK	Not cool, Roger. Not cool.
M	ALAN	So what did happen last night?
M	ROGER	Oh, well, you guys came in near the end of our last set, like 2ish. Doug pretty much dragged you in.
M	ALAN	Really? Doug did?
M	ROGER	Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug. Black guy, shaved head? The guys look at each other, confused.
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	He's a cake designer, he said he met you guys at some sort of birthday party at the Rio?
M	VICK	The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance video. The guys nod, right.
M	ROGER	Anyway, for the big finale of our show, we always bring someone on stage, and, well, Stu, you volunteered pretty aggressively. Hey Dallas, do we have the video of last night's show?
M	STU	No! That's cool, I don't need to see it--
M	VICK	We must see that video.
M	DALLAS	It's in the machine. Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting
M	ROGER	You were pretty mellow at first, Stu, but once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive-- oh, here it is.
M	STU	I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym as much as I'd like...
M	ROGER	You even taught us The Pony, which we'd never even heard of before... ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly
M	ROGER (CONT'D)	And then, of course, the pièce de resistance: the Ride of the Valkyries. ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride
M	STU	Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain.
M	ROGER	After the show, we split a couple pitchers of flirtinis, you had our stylist cut your hair like mine, and then you split.
M	VICK	And what time was all this?
M	ROGER	4:30 in the morning? 4:45?
M	ALAN	And our Doug was with us?
M	ROGER	Yeah, he had passed out by then, but you carried him out. It was all very Officer And A Gentleman. The guys look at each other, confused.
M	ALAN	Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us?
M	STU	That doesn't make any sense.
M	VICK	Did we lose him along the way?
M	STU	He was passed out, how far could he have gone--? Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads
M	VICK	Hello?
M	ATASHIR	Mr. Lennon?
M	VICK	Atashir, many greetings to you.
M	ATASHIR	I thought you might like to know that one of our maids just found your friend, Douglas, passed out in your room. Vick's jaw drops.
M	VICK	What?! Are you sure it's him?!
M	ATASHIR	I saw him with my own eyes. He is unconscious but breathing nicely.
M	VICK	Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a man of great honor! A thousand blessings upon your ancestors! Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Doug is in the room! A maid just found him! He's passed out, but he's okay!
M	STU	They're sure it's him?!
M	VICK	Atashir swears it is! The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted.
M	STU	Oh thank God he's okay...
M	ALAN	After all this?! He's in the room?! They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even
M	VICK	I don't even care! Hug me, you big shiny homosexual!
M	ALAN	That was cool of Roger to give you all the tapes of your performance.
M	STU	I know, if I actually was gay, I'd totally date Roger first. What a gentle soul. They get into Vick's clunker.
M	VICK	How we doing on time?
M	ALAN	
M	VICK	We'll be in LA by dawn. I told you bitches this would all work out... They drive off into the night, grins all around.
M	ALAN	This has officially been the craziest weekend of my life. Thanks for all your help. You were awesome.
M	CHASTITY	Anything for my hubby. Alan's smile flickers slightly.
M	CHASTITY (CONT'D)	I'm kidding, Alan. I know last night wasn't, you know, real... She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.
M	ALAN	I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.
M	CHASTITY	Jennifer.
M	ALAN	Beg pardon?
M	CHASTITY	My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly. Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.
M	ALAN	Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.
M	CHASTITY	Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the first flaky decision I've ever made in my life. I mean, I am a stripper. Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.
M	ALAN	Where you from?
M	CHASTITY	LA. Tarzana.
M	ALAN	Oh yeah?
M	CHASTITY	Yeah. I work here on the weekends.
M	ALAN	You fly out every week?
M	CHASTITY	Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a great school.
M	ALAN	Kid?
M	VICK	They always have kids.
M	CHASTITY	I have a little girl, Sarah. She's... Well, she's everything. Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute What about you?
M	ALAN	No kids. Same girlfriend for 14 years. Becky. Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.
M	CHASTITY	Wow, she's stunning. Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:
M	STU	We like you way better. Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.
M	ALAN (CONT'D)	Becky is great.
M	STU	Becky collects teapots.
M	VICK	Yeah, she's a total canwego.
M	CHASTITY	A what?
M	VICK	You know, she's the girl at the party who's always like "Can we go? Can we go?" Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.
M	ALAN	She has low blood sugar.
M	STU	She has low fun sugar.
M	ALAN	Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm going to marry! If, you know...she forgives me for cheating on her...
M	VICK	Wait: you're going to tell her?
M	ALAN	Of course I'm going to tell her! I could never keep something like that from her.
M	VICK	Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me for scratching her Queensryche CD in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever gonna forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas.
M	ALAN	Well, then that's just the price I'm going to have to pay. Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.
M	CHASTITY	Good for you. She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her
M	VICK	She's gonna cut your dick off, dude.
M	VICK	Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be right back.
M	VICK	Doug! Wake up, man!
M	KALOLO FANALUA	Aloha, assholes. The guys freeze.
M	STU	Uh-oh. The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see
M	STU (CONT'D)	Not good. Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a
M	JIMMY LANG	Oh, hello. Good to see you again.
M	VICK	Where is Doug?
M	ALAN	Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did last night, we are incredibly sorry-
M	JIMMY LANG	These your rich friends you were telling me about, Vick? Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused.
M	JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)	Oh, you haven't told them yet? Really, that's low. Even for you.
M	ALAN	What's going on, Vick? Vick stammers, trying to find the words...
M	JIMMY LANG	Six months ago, your friend Vick borrowed some money from me at what can only be described as a very unfavorable interest rate. When the loan came due, he failed to pay me back, but he promised me that he could get the money from you guys this weekend. Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt.
M	ALAN	Jesus, Vick...
M	STU	How could you do this to us, man? We're your best friends... Vick looks away, ashamed.
M	VICK	They were gonna hurt me, man...
M	JIMMY LANG	Well, Vick, it looks like you and your friends have some issues to discuss. In the meantime... He draws a huge, red-plated .357 MAGNUM.
M	JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)	I need my goddamn money. The guys jump back, whoa! Vick holds up his hands:
M	VICK	I can get it! I can! I just--
M	JIMMY LANG	I've heard that before, Vick, including last night, when you so rudely skipped out on my birthday party. That's why I've taken some collateral to ensure your payment. His name is Doug. The guys all look sick.
M	VICK	You have Doug?
M	STU	Oh my God...
M	JIMMY LANG	If you want your friend to live, meet me at mile marker 26 off Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the money. Are we clear?
M	VICK	Yes! Yes. Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.
M	ALAN	M-M-Mr. Lang?
M	JIMMY LANG	Yes, Mr. Mervish?
M	ALAN	H-How much does Vick owe? 200 thousand dollars?!
M	ALAN	How the hell could you blow that kind of money?!
M	STU	Was it for the custard store?
M	ALAN	Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no custard store! Vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back Jimmy Lang!
M	STU	Is that true, Vick? Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it.
M	STU (CONT'D)	Were any of your deals...real? Some. Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned...
M	STU	Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that money meant something to me... Vick spins around, furious:
M	VICK	Do you really think I wanted my life to turn out like this, Stu?! Do you really think I don't know that I'm a massive loser?! Jesus, you guys got out of high school and you just knew what to do, you went to college and got good jobs and found cool wives and made beautiful children -- what do I have to show for the last decade of my life?! Nothing! Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only thing I really have...the only thing I really have is you guys.
M	STU	Come on, Vick--
M	VICK	No, man, it's true! I put on a good show, but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man. I-I don't know how much longer I can keep this scam going. And now I've gone and ruined the one good thing I had... Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry.
M	VICK (CONT'D)	Just...please don't give up on me, okay? I-I don't know what I'd do without you guys. I really don't... Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky
M	STU	Come on, man, we've been bro's since third grade, it's gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship. Vick looks down, deeply touched... What I don't understand is why you didn't just ask me for the money. I would've given you every last cent I had, man... Tears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a
M	STU (CONT'D)	I love you, man.
M	VICK	Love you too, bro. Love you too. They hug tight. For a while.
M	STU	Also, I banged your sister sophomore year. Vick pulls away.
M	VICK	What?!
M	STU	Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell you. Vick stammers at Stu, speechless.
M	STU (CONT'D)	She had just broken up with that guy from Central, we were playing "I Never" at Tim Donahee's pool, one thing lead to another--
M	VICK	No! No. That's...that's plenty. Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan
M	ALAN	Look, I'm glad we're all sharing, but we've got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else... The guys nod, frowning, back on point.
M	ALAN (CONT'D)	I'd offer to take a loan out, but it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm pretty sure my bank is closed.
M	STU	I think I can get a 20 grand cash advance on my credit card... So that just leaves 180 grand... The guys frown at each other.
M	CHASTITY	Well, it is Vegas... The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...?
M	STU	Time check!
M	VICK	12 minutes.
M	STU	Chip check! Alan quickly counts the chips... Faster! Come on chip check!
M	VICK	Dude, how many Red Bulls have you had?
M	STU	I stopped counting at six! I can hear my heart beating in my head! Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.
M	ALAN	Just over 100 grand. The guys wince, damn.
M	VICK	There's only one thing left to do. They all exchange a knowing look...
M	STU	You sure we don't want red?! What if the ball lands on red--!
M	VICK	Shut up, Stu.
M	ROULETTE CROUPIER	Betting is closed. The Croupier drops the ball into the wheel. It bounces, hops,
M	STU	I can't watch! My heart's gonna explode! Can your heart even explode?! Because I think my heart is gonna explode! I can't watch! The ball lands. Dead silence. It's red, isn't it?! I knew it! Tell me it's not red!
M	ALAN	It's not red... Stu turns, ecstatic-- It's green. The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his
M	CHASTITY	Would you like me to come with?
M	ALAN	No...It might get a little dangerous. I wouldn't want... He trails off. Chastity nods.
M	CHASTITY	I'm so sorry...about everything.
M	ALAN	Thanks for all your help. Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.
M	CHASTITY	There's no sense...in exchanging numbers or anything...right?
M	ALAN	Yeah, probably not... Alan looks genuinely sad.
M	CHASTITY	Well...I'll always remember you as a great first husband, then. They both smile weakly. You can just send the divorce papers to the Crazy Horse or whatever... Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.
M	CHASTITY (CONT'D)	Thanks for reminding me that there are still some really good guys out there, Alan. I don't...I don't get to meet too many of them. She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks Then Vick fires up the car next to him.
M	VICK	We gotta go, man. Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...
M	ALAN	Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong...? The guys all frown.
M	STU	So what's our plan?
M	ALAN	I think we should tell Mr. Lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar--
M	VICK	We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab Doug, and make a run for it.
M	ALAN	Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!
M	VICK	Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back! Left turn! Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road.
M	THE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN	streaking across Venice Beach.
F	TRACY	Any word from Doug?
M	MR. TURNER	Nope. I know you don't want to hear it, Trace, but you deserve better. Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress.
F	TRACY	I'm sure everything's fine. They're all smart, capable adults...
M	VICK	This all the cash we got? The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to
M	ALAN	This is the dumbest plan ever.
M	VICK	Alan I need you positive please.
M	STU	Here they come. They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far
M	VICK	Stuart?
M	STU	Yeah?
M	VICK	There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out please. Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He
M	ALAN	I can't believe this is how we're going to die... The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves.
M	JIMMY LANG	Let's see the money! Vick gently holds up his duffel bag.
M	VICK	Let's see Doug! Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the
M	ALAN	Jesus, what'd they do to him?
M	VICK	Pull off the Ralph's bag! Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal
M	IT'S NOT DOUG	It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused.
M	VICK	Who the hell is that?! This is Doug! He pushes the guy forward.
M	ALAN	Oh my God: it's the other Doug! Roger's friend, the cake designer!
M	BLACK DOUG	I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland! I barely even know these guys!
M	VICK	Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man! Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated.
M	JIMMY LANG	You sure?!
M	VICK	Yeah, man, our Doug is white!
M	JIMMY LANG	But you were partying with this guy at my birthday thing!
M	VICK	I don't know what to tell you, bro, this isn't the Doug we requested!
M	JIMMY LANG	Well. I apologize for the mix-up... But I'm still gonna need my money. Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.
M	ALAN	Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...
M	JIMMY LANG	Don't move, Vick. Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from
M	JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)	Now please. Give me my money. All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand...
M	JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)	Don't be stupid, son. You-- Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in
M	NOTHING HAPPENS	Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy
M	VICK	Christ that hurts! Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the
M	BACK BY THE YUKON	The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult
M	ON BLACK DOUG	He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his
M	BY THE CADDILAC	Alan looks around, what should I do?! What should I do?! Then Bullets pound into the Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified,
M	ALAN	I'm being shot at! I'm being shot at!
M	UP AHEAD	Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun,
M	JIMMY LANG	I really didn't want to kill anyone Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph! The guys freeze, shocked. The Guamians freeze, shocked.
M	ALAN	Oh my god, is he okay?!
M	VICK	Who cares! Go go! Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in!
M	BULLETS IMPACT ALL ALL OVER CAR	taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests.
M	STU	I can't believe you just saved my life!
M	VICK	I can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang! Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.
M	STU	He's gonna be really upset!
M	ALAN	Yeah, I was just thinking that!
M	BACK ON JIMMY LANG	The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two
M	KIKIOLANI	Boss, Boss, you okay?! Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.
M	JIMMY LANG	Find Vick... And kill him.
M	ALAN	Now can we call Tracy?
M	VICK	Yeah. It's probably time.
M	ALAN	Who wants to make the call? Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and
M	STU	That was you!
M	ALAN	What?! No! I beat you by a mile!
M	STU	Vick, who won?! Actually...I should do it. This weekend was mostly my fault. I need to Man Up. Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound
M	ALAN	Well, I'll be damned... Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.
M	VICK	I still can't believe Stu banged my sister. Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the
M	MR. TURNER	Any word from Doug? The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
F	TRACY	No, but I'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it.
M	TRACY (CONT'D)	Hello?
M	VICK	In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted
M	VICK	Tracy, it's Vick.
F	TRACY	Hey Vick!
M	VICK	Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug.
F	TRACY	What?! But we're getting married in like four hours!
M	VICK	Yeah, that's not gonna happen...
M	BACK IN THE CAR	Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes,
M	BACK TO VICK	on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite.
M	VICK	Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This is all my fault-- Suddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver What the--?! Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing.
M	ALAN	Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just joking around! We've got Doug right here! Vick looks like: what?! What kind of joke is that?!
M	ALAN	I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll see you at the wedding! Bye! Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows.
M	VICK	What are you doing?
M	ALAN	I know where Doug is!
M	ALAN	Remember when we saw Doug's bed impaled on the griffin thing?!
M	STU	Yeah, we threw it out the window.
M	ALAN	No: the windows don't open, remember?!
M	VICK	So how did--? Oh my God.
M	STU	I don't get it.
M	ALAN	And that's why we've been seeing Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He was trying to signal someone!
M	VICK	I don't believe it...
M	STU	I-I still don't get it--
M	ALAN	And it totally jives with the timeline, right?! We brought Doug back to the hotel at 5:00, he was passed out...
M	VICK	It's so obvious!
M	STU	Not...to me...so much?
M	VICK	How'd you figure it out?!
M	ALAN	The Patron, man! It reminded me of our first drink of the night!
M	VICK	Honestly, dude, you're a genius.
M	VICK	He's on the roof! Stu looks confused, the roof?
M	ALAN	After Doug passed out, we must've taken him up there in his bed as a prank, so he'd wake up on the roof or whatever? Then we forgot him.
M	VICK	And all day he's been throwing his crap off the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down!
M	STU	You think he's still up there?!
M	ALAN	Only one way to find out... But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair...
M	IS DOUG!	And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!
M	STU	Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay! Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and
M	DOUG	Don't...even...talk to me. The guys stop short.
M	VICK	Okay, no, that's cool!
M	STU	Yeah, you have every right to be upset! We validate your anger!
M	VICK	Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?! Why did you betray us?!
M	ATASHIR	Because they paid me. And also because you're kind of racist.
M	VICK	Fair enough! See you next time, you beautiful Judas! They blow out of the hotel...
M	ALAN	No flights to LA with empty seats!
M	STU	Well, we can't drive! It's 350 miles to LA and the wedding starts at 10, which is in-- --three hours! Beat. Then Vick, Stu and Alan exchange a look...a smile
M	VICK	Look, Doug, I think I speak for everyone in the car when I say I'm really sorry about locking you on the roof of the hotel.
M	STU	You gotta admit, it's a pretty funny prank... I mean, up until the part when we forgot all about you. Doug just stares out at the desert in stony silence.
M	STU (CONT'D)	He's still not talking to us.
M	ALAN	Totally understandable, man. Whenever you're ready... The driver gives Vick a thumbs up, and heads off. Alan rips TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 10:19AM"
M	MR. TURNER	I'm sorry, honey, but I think you need to seriously consider that Doug might not be coming... Tracy stops short, speechless.
M	MR. TURNER (CONT'D)	Some men just aren't cut out for this kind of commitment. I'm so sorry that this is how you had to find out-- Just then, we hear a car SQUEALING UP outside...
M	VICK, ALAN, STU, AND DOUG	stride inside! Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a
M	VICK	Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy route. We ready to do this thing? The bridesmaids sit up, stunned.
M	TRACY AND HER FATHER	walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays. Tracy
M	IN THE AUDIENCE	Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos...
M	AT THE ALTAR	The groomsmen smile as well. Vick whispers to Doug:
M	VICK	She looks beautiful, man. Doug still doesn't speak to him. That's cool. I get it.
F	TRACY	reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His face is a mess
F	TRACY	I love you, Daddy.
M	MR. TURNER	I love you too, pumpkin. Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him,
F	TRACY	Where were you? And why are you pink?
M	DOUG	It's a long story. All I can say is I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as long as we're married, I will never ever put you through something like this again. Can... Can you forgive me? Tracy studies his face, searching... All the guests wait with bated breath... The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on...
M	MINISTER	We, um, we traditionally wait til the end for the kiss...? But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing...
M	DOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING	at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding.
M	CHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED	and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn,
M	VICK	We did it, fellahs. We pulled it off.
M	ALAN	I never had a doubt. They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen
M	STU	You think Doug's ever going to talk to us again?
M	VICK	Give him time.
M	ALAN	Yeah. Like a decade or two-- Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.
M	STU	Uh-oh. The guys all look over to see
M	BECKY	Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate.
M	VICK	Hey Beck--!
M	BECKY	Shut up, Vick! Alan, where the hell have you been?! I've been calling and calling! What, you don't answer your phone anymore?! Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend.
M	ALAN	I-I'm so sorry, I can explain-- Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Alan? They all turn to see
M	CHASTITY	standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her
M	VICK	This just got complicated...
M	ALAN	Jennifer? Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.
M	CHASTITY	I-I know I wasn't invited, but I just had to return this... She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky
M	BECKY	Okay: who the hell is this chick, and why the hell does she have your Grandmother's wedding ring?! Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity...
M	BECKY (CONT'D)	Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just like your mother! Talk! Who's the ho wearing my ring?! And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns:
M	ALAN	She's my wife. Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick We don't make each other happy anymore, Beck. And we can keep not making each other happy for another 14 years -- hell, maybe even another 50 years -- but let's not. Let's find people who make our hearts race. Let's be excited and fun and alive again... Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.
M	BECKY	Are you fucking kidding me? Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.
M	ALAN	I'm sorry, Beck. I really am. Can I buy you a free drink? Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together
M	CHASTITY	We're not...actually...still married, are we?
M	ALAN	Let's start with dinner, and see where it goes...?
M	CHASTITY	I'd like that.
M	BACK ON BECKY	She finally recovers enough to speak:
M	BECKY	Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back here this second! Don't you walk away from me, you stupid little clown! I own you! GET
M	BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY!	But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.
M	STAY WITH STU	as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he
M	VOICE	Daddy?! Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses
M	STU	Oh, I missed you guys so much!
M	HAYLEE	We missed you too, daddy!
M	KAITLIN	You're the best dad ever! Beat. And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere.
F	ERIN	Jesus, are you still drunk? Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her
M	VICK	Okay, okay, I'll go with you. Just...don't ruin the wedding. Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.
M	JIMMY LANG	I really didn't want it to end like this, Vick. Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy Good luck.
M	VICK	Um, what...?
M	JIMMY LANG	Your friend Alan just paid your marker. Took out a second mortgage on his house. The full 200 grand, plus medical expenses, which I thought was a classy touch. Vick looks blown away.
M	JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)	Without our friends, we are nothing, Vick. Remember that. The three injured mobsters exit. Vick remains standing there, standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in
M	VICK	I will pay you back, you know.
M	ALAN	Damn straight you will! They all LAUGH.
M	VOICE BEHIND THEM	Okay, so what the hell happened this weekend? The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling. They grin as
M	VICK	Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu went gay, and I learned a very important life lesson from an obese hoodlum.
M	STU	We'll tell you the whole story when you get back from your honeymoon.
M	ALAN	We really are sorry, man. Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail.
M	VICK	To Doug and Tracy.
M	STU	To Doug and Tracy.
M	ALAN	To Doug and Tracy.
M	DOUG	To me and Tracy -- and to being here, with my three former best friends in the world... The guys LAUGH.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now. They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.
M	DOUG (CONT'D)	That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? I'm going on my honeymoon in 24 hours... The guys all nod reassuringly.
M	THE GUYS	No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally, dude. The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then
