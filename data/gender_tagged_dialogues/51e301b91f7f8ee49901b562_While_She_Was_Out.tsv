M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	KENNETH	Yes!
M	KENNETH (CONT'D)	Damn! DELLA!
F	DELLA	SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's favorite doll.
M	KENNETH	You should just swear properly and get it over with. Do you think the kids don't know what you mean?
M	KENNETH (CONT'D)	Going out again? What is it tonight? Auto Mechanics for Dummies? The bored housewives' reading group?
M	KENNETH (CONT'D)	I got a new one for you. Group therapy for women who always have the curse. There's a Tuesday night class at the Pleasant Valley Episcopalian.
F	DELLA	I'm going to the mall for wrapping paper.
M	KENNETH	What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this?
M	KENNETH (CONT'D)	I mean it's not like you're at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other men's wives.
M	KENNETH (CONT'D)	The last time I saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party. God, Della, you used to be hot!
F	DELLA	Put the twins to bed by eight. Give them a chocolate cookie with their milk.
M	KENNETH	Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm sorry.
F	TAMMI	Mommy can I get an American Girl for Christmas?
M	TERRI	I want a raptor dinosaur, Mommy.
F	DELLA	You better leave Santa a note. It's only three days until Christmas.
F	TAMMI	Where are you going, Mommy?
F	DELLA	The Mall. One chocolate cookie each and then Daddy will read you a bedtime story.
F	TAMMI	Daddy's stories are lame. I want you to read us a story.
M	TERRI	Yeah Mommy, the one about the pirates.
F	TAMMI	No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and Slingshot Kitty.
F	DELLA	Tomorrow night I'll read you the best bedtime story in the whole world. I promise.
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	I'll check in on you both when I get back. To make sure you're sleeping.
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	Thank you, Tammi, it's wonderful.
F	DELLA	Frick! C'MON...
F	DELLA	I'll get right on that Kenneth honey. AFTER you stop drinking.
F	DELLA	Hello?
M	MARY (V.O.)	Della, it's Mary Messina.
F	DELLA	Oh, hey. You okay sweetie?
F	DELLA	Sure. How are you? I'm well.
F	DELLA	How'd you get my cell number?
M	MARY (V.O.)	I called Kenneth at the house.
F	DELLA	And how'd that go? Did he give you an earful for disturbing his ninety ninth viewing of Lethal Weapon Four?
M	MARY (V.O.)	Oh Della. Kenneth is always charming. At least to me.
F	DELLA	Well, with the way you flaunt your double D boob job at the free fun PTA events that's hardly a surprise. What was that?
F	DELLA	Oh nothing, Mary. You got lucky with that one. Patricia Ellis says he's the best looking guy in Pleasant Valley.
F	DELLA	Well that wouldn't be hard. Mary, do you need something? Cause I gotta go. Yes, are you going to Tool School tomorrow? TOOL SCHOOL?, Ouch, Mary. Do It Yourself Mechanics is without a doubt the most interesting thing in my life right now. I carry my beloved toolbox in the trunk at all times.
M	MARY (V.O.)	I'm just joking, Della. You know me. I pre-paid ten classes and only made it to two. If you are going I could use a ride. I'd hate to miss another class.
F	DELLA	Sorry, Mary, I'm skipping this week. Kenneth's parents are coming to stay for Christmas. You know how it is.
M	MARY (V.O.)	Oh that's too bad. Maybe Patricia Ellis will be going.
F	DELLA	You check with her, Mary.
M	MARY (V.O.)	Merry Christmas. God bless you and your family.
F	DELLA	You too. Bah Humbug.
M	MARY (V.O.)	Pardon?
F	DELLA	Bye, Mary.
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	Cellular 411 connect. How may I direct your call?
F	DELLA	The Learning Academy. Spring Street.
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	Please hold for that number.
M	Scene 20Page 12	Press your pound key now to connect with your request.
M	MEGHAN (V.O.)	Learning Academy, this is Meghan.
F	DELLA	Hi Meghan. It's Della Myers. Oh hey. You calling about Spanish for Beginners? You know that Tom cancelled 'cause of New Year's.
F	DELLA	Yes I knew. Can you hold, I have another call?
F	DELLA	Okay.
M	LOCAL AD	Pleasant Valley Dream Homes. The lowest crime rate in the US. Call 1- 800-SAFE. Sorry Della ...
F	DELLA	Can you leave word for Mike. I'm going to miss tomorrow's Mechanic's class. It's just the one time.
M	MEGHAN (V.O.)	Everyone misses that class at least once.
F	DELLA	I guess some people find it boring.
M	MEGHAN (V.O.)	We'll see you the first week in January then?
F	DELLA	Yes you will...unless I run off and become an outlaw or something.
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	I have to go.
M	MEGHAN	Merry Christmas You too.
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	Hello? Hi Della... it's Cassie.
F	DELLA	Where are you? Grand Central Station?
M	CASSIE	Hold on, I'll take the phone outside.
F	DELLA	FRICK!
M	Scene 21Page 14	Just a minute, Della.
F	DELLA	I almost rear-ended a car. Cassie?
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	What's up, Cassie? I'm over at Southeast Plaza. What was it we need to get for Pilates?
F	DELLA	Huh? One of those rubber balls, I think. I'm headed over there now. Ran out of Christmas wrapping paper. Would you believe it? It's hell here tonight. Everyone and their uncle is at the mall.
F	DELLA	Aw shoot. My cell battery's dying.
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	Damn, I must have left the charger in the other car. You want me to pick up something for you while I'm here?
F	DELLA	No....I'm just. I mean I'm. Oh nothing.
M	CASSIE (V.O.)	Your phone's breaking up Della. I'm not joking when I say it's packed over here.
F	DELLA	It can't be that bad?
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	Why don't we meet somewhere for a drink? Sure, but a latte's about the best they can do in this mall.
F	DELLA	A latte's fine. Let's meet at the fountain opposite Victoria's Secret.
M	CASSIE (V.O.)	Sounds good.
F	DELLA	My battery's going. I'm a block away. See you in five minutes.
M	CASSIE (V.O.)	Okay but I won't be able to wait very ....
F	DELLA	Okay, okay!
M	MOTHER	Watch where you're going!
F	DELLA	Sorry!
F	DELLA	Lucky son of a .....
M	ANGRY DRIVER	If you think you're gonna steal my spot, think again, asshole!
F	DELLA	Hello?
M	RENT-A-COP	Can I help you?
F	DELLA	Do you know where I can definitely find parking?
M	RENT-A-COP	There's nothing close by. Even the valet's backed up. You might want to try further out.
M	RENT-A-COP (CONT'D)	But be willing to walk.
F	DELLA	Yes!
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	Unbelievable!
F	DELLA	GREAT!
M	PERFUME SALES LADY	It's a classic revival of Chanel No.5. We have a wonderful Christmas Special on offer at Macy's.
F	DELLA	Thanks.
M	VS SALES ASSISTANT	It's pure silk, the last one in our classic black label collection. Would you like me to fix you a changing room?
F	DELLA	No thanks. Not my size.
M	Scene 39Page 22	
F	DELLA	A latte please?
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	And a chocolate biscotti.
M	OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT	Bitter or Milk chocolate?
F	DELLA	Forget it, just the coffee.
M	OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT	Name?
F	DELLA	Della, two L's.
M	OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT	Four dollars and seventy nine cents.
M	Scene 40Page 23	
M	LYNN (O.S.)	Della, is that you?
F	DELLA	Lynn Monroe!
F	LYNN	I knew it was you, Della. I haven't seen you since college. You left to marry some handsome jock and we never heard from you again.
F	DELLA	Something like that. Do you live around here now?
F	LYNN	David and I just bought this divine house in Pleasant Valley. Do you know it? Great for the kids.
M	LYNN (CONT'D)	It's the first time I've left the doors unlocked since I was a child growing up in the Midwest. David's been promoted to VP of United Motors so it's all happening for us. But enough of me. How are you?
F	DELLA	Oh, we have two kids. Twins, Tammi and Terri.
F	LYNN	Why that's fantastic. Listen Della, it's been great talking to you but I have to go get my hair done! David and I are going out tomorrow night for a romantic dinner. I just bought this gorgeous teddy from Victoria's Secret.
M	LYNN (CONT'D)	Hope we bump into each other again soon, sweetie. Merry Christmas
F	DELLA	It's a pity they don't have any "To a bastard at Christmas" cards.
M	PH SALES ASSISTANT	Perfect timing!
F	DELLA	God planned it for Christmas Day just to tick me off.
M	PH SALES ASSISTANT	Thirty dollars and sixty nine cents
F	DELLA	Thanks.
M	PH SALES ASSISTANT	Merry Christmas.
F	DELLA	How come the ladies' bathroom is out of order on a night like this?
M	CLEANING LADY	The one at the other side of the mall is open, Ma'am.
M	Scene 43Page 26	
M	CAROL SINGERS	Silent Night. Holy Night. All is calm. All is bright.

Then, you go slipping an incendiary note up under my windscreen wipers. CH be an invitation to war to me and my ghetto soldiers.

M	Scene 67Page 38	
F	DELLA	Huh!

M	TOMAS (O.S.)	Keep hitting on the gas and you gonna dig them wheels into a dirt grave.
M	CHUCKIE (O.S.)	Save yo talk and get out and push.
M	TOMAS	Hell, no.
M	HUEY	Shit! What's aggravating you now?
M	HUEY	Our new sneakers are stuck up in the dirt like they was last years.
M	CHUCKIE	Soon as we taken care o' Mrs. Podunk you and the Spanish dancer can hit the next mall. But first you fakers best haul this rider out of the filth.
M	VINH	Stupid ass car got nowhere else to go. There's nothing but trees up ahead.
M	TOMAS	Screw the car, Chuckie. Case you forgot we got a witness on the loose! I ain't want to end up in the clink as some chimp's prison pillow.
M	CHUCKIE	Trust me dog, hoe's going down execution style before we see the other side o' them bars.
M	TOMAS	Yo talk a real mob threat, Chuckie. But what if she gone already?
M	CHUCKIE	She ain't gone.
M	CHUCKIE	Won't be long before we find her now. This baby could spot a needle in a haystack!
M	HUEY	We caught up in this bitch's life like a soap opera. We could just bail, blast out of town like we was never here.
M	CHUCKIE	This boy loves weed so much he tried to marry Juana.
M	HUEY	Ain't no one cares about the Rent-a- Pig. He just collateral damage to the peeps at the mall.
M	CHUCKIE	Listen up skippy: SHE THE ONLY WITNESS.
M	HUEY	But if we hit the road now we'll be five hundred miles away before they find him....we could be drinking cold beer and swimmin' in the Atlantic....just like you promised.
M	CHUCKIE	We gotta take care of her. When she gone. The problem gone. Right? We'll head off then, Huey, just like I said.
M	HUEY	We ain't gonna make it, are we Chuckie? I ain't never gonna see it. It's over for that, isn't it Chuckie? Just say it.
M	HUEY (CONT'D)	She was just some stupid housewife mouthin' off.
M	CHUCKIE	GET REAL Huey! And shut the fuck up about the stupid ocean.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	I ever break a promise to you? I ever let you down?
M	HUEY	No Chuckie, you ain't.

M	HUEY	Someone call her mama tell her to lay out her black dress.
M	TOMAS	Is she dead already?
M	VINH	Musta gone been thrown through the windshield.

M	Scene 96Page 50	You a window shopper little brother. You ain't never even done the old in and out before.
M	HUEY	Imma just a young playa tryin' to put my bid in.
M	TOMAS	Don't worry, when we done wit you we send yo back in yo trunk to Mr. Podunk. Don't want to play nice? Puta!
M	Scene 96Page 51	
M	CHUCKIE	Back off five minutes, my Ghetto brother.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	What's with the man size crast?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	You running with the family jewels?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	You rob a bank this morning, Della?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Least yo learned something tonight Della honey?
M	VINH	Yeah, like how to quit mouthing if you wanna avoid drama.
M	CHUCKIE	You must be wondering how we come to know your name.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	You screwed up Della Myers. Left your purse in the Ford.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	What a shitty photo!
M	Scene 96Page 52	Guess you won't be needing it no more.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	So what's in the box?
M	HUEY	Yo think she carrying the big notes, maybe some ice?
M	CHUCKIE	Nah, it ain't about to rain diamonds, Huey. But maybe she cashed in her life savings. Planned to take off, start a new life.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	That right Della?
M	TOMAS	You got enough scratch in there to grease us up with?
M	CHUCKIE	Open it.
M	Scene 96Page 53	Open the box else we put you in trauma.

M	TOMAS	Mamacita! Madre de Dios!
M	CHUCKIE	You tread on my boy's face. YOU KILLED HIM.
M	TOMAS	I didn't kill him. I didn't kill no one.
M	TOMAS (CONT'D)	She did it. She killed him.
M	TOMAS (CONT'D)	I'm gonna cross that bitch out.
M	CHUCKIE	DELLA!
F	DELLA	Shit! Oh Shit!
M	CHUCKIE	What the fuck you doing? I asked you what your deal is, sand dancer?
M	VINH	It's a tribute. A gesture.
M	CHUCKIE	A what?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Your brain even smaller than 'em slits for eyes? Keep on banging out that ghetto ass shit and you'll alert every cop in Podunk county.
M	VINH	It's for Huey. Our dead homie.
M	CHUCKIE	You checked out, right?
M	VINH	He loved that track.
M	CHUCKIE	Get a grip, skippy.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Huey's DEAD. And ain't no requiem gonna resurrect his ass. He down under the ground now with the real men of respect.
M	TOMAS	I didn't mean it. I didn't do it. I didn't mean to kill him.
M	CHUCKIE	Well he dead. That's it for him. OVER. But we still here. Hell, yeah. Payback's gonna be a real bitch for a real bitch.
M	VINH	She probably gone by now.

M	TOMAS	I can smell her Bulgari.
M	CHUCKIE	She was right here. Must a saw your dumb ass tribute and everything.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Bulgari? She looks more like she rocks that number five shit.
M	TOMAS	It Bulgari, dude. My Dad's bitch bathes in it.
M	CHUCKIE	There more of her footprints.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	What you waiting on? Jackie Chan?
M	VINH (O.S.)	SHIT!
M	TOMAS (O.S.)	What now, cabron? Fell in a frozen ass stream.
M	CHUCKIE	Zipperhead!
M	VINH	Kon'aro Kusotare.
M	CHUCKIE	You know we don't speak the Chinky.
M	VINH	What's your game, Chuckie? We left stumbling around in the dark while you hog the flashlight.
M	CHUCKIE	I stole it. I get to use it. That's how it works. That right Tomas?
M	TOMAS	Right on, dog.
M	VINH	What if I steal it from you?
M	CHUCKIE	There you go, bro. April Fool. Naw, wait a minute, it ain't April. Must be Christmas fool.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Her footprints disappear at the big rock.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Head on up and search the slope. I'll guide your way with the flashlight.
M	TOMAS	We gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch!
M	TOMAS (CONT'D)	You going home in a casket tonight.
M	CHUCKIE	THERE SHE IS, TOP OF THE GULCH!
M	TOMAS	AHHHHHEEEEEEHHHHH!

M	VINH (CONT'D)	I saw Huey, there in the brush.
M	CHUCKIE	What?
M	VINH	I saw him.
M	CHUCKIE	Sure you did, bro.
M	Scene 104Page 67	
M	TOMAS	CONEJO! AIN'T NUTHIN' CAN SAVE YO ASS NOW.
F	DELLA	Awwwrgh!
M	TOMAS	Unnh! Unnh! Unnh! Unnh! TOMAS!
M	CHUCKIE (O.S.)	Curb the squealing. You a gangsta or a boy scout?
M	VINH (O.S.)	Tomas's gone, Chuckie. I can feel it.
M	CHUCKIE	Tomas is one hard son of a bitch. He got her strung up from a tree by now and you know it.
M	VINH	There's something over here.
M	VINH (CONT'D)	It looks like a body.
M	CHUCKIE	It's a big old tree trunk, you paranoid gook.
M	VINH	Tomas.....IYAH!
M	VINH (CONT'D)	She gonna kill you and me next. We're all gonna die here. God knows what other tools she got in that box.
M	CHUCKIE	It was a stupid ass accident killed Huey. You know that. And Tomas....
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	I promise you this.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	This baby's gonna cancel her Christmas.
M	VINH (O.S.)	Ain't no gun can kill a ghost gone bad. You in America now, dude, where the ghosts bleed.
F	DELLA	I'm sorry.
M	DELLA (CONT'D)	I'm so sorry! Where are you, God?
M	Scene 106Page 73	Please, I just want to see my babies again.
M	VINH	Aaaarrhh.
M	Scene 109Page 76	
M	VINH	I don't feel good, Chuckie. You think I got the hypothermia?
M	CHUCKIE	Nah, yo got the yellow fever.
M	VINH	I'm telling you, it ain't natural how she gets away every time.
M	CHUCKIE	She got to be hiding up on the slope? You head up first and I'll follow with the flashlight.
M	VINH	I ain't going up there without the gun. End of story.
M	CHUCKIE	Never would've pegged you as a pussy, Vinh. Even when Huey and Tomas called it, I always defended your ass.
M	VINH	Ain't no one never said I was a pussy.
M	CHUCKIE	She a skinny ass bitch, too. Can't be weighing in at more than one twenty. Tomas an Huey never called me a pussy.
M	CHUCKIE	I ain't speaking ill o' the dead.
M	VINH	You already did.
M	CHUCKIE	Anyways, when you ever shot a gun? Probably miss and shoot yourself in the foot.
M	CHUCKIE	That's the spirit gangsta. Holler if you see her and I'll shoot.
M	VINH	Faito!
M	VINH (CONT'D)	CHUUUCCKKKKIEEE!
M	CHUCKIE (O.S.)	Vinh? VINH?
M	CHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Della?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Delllaaa?
M	CHUCKIE	There's only you and me, now.
M	Scene 111Page 81	I saw a little trail of your blood back there. You must be hurt. I'm hurting too. I think you busted up my collarbone.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	I know you can hear me, Della.
M	CHUCKIE?	I can smell your blood, your sweat. I know you're close.
M	CHUCKIE	After what went down tonight, we got a special bond.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	May as well come out now, Della.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	I'll save one for you, for when you decide to come out.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	You're one tough bitch.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	And that's hot, hell yeah.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	And they're really cute.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Twins huh? Terri and Tammi.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	I bet you could use that cigarette now Della honey? A woman's purse can tell her whole life story!
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Now I know where they are living, I'm thinking I may stop by after and say hello.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	They wouldn't know a damn thing about what happened to Mommy while she was out, would they, Della?
F	DELLA	I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.
M	CHUCKIE	I figured that would help you find your voice!
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Don't worry. I would never touch them. It's wrong to hurt kids! Right, Della?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	The game's over.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	You won! You took him from me...He was only seventeen years old. And all he ever wanted to do was see the ocean. And he never saw it. No, he never got to go.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	They're all gone now. You know the movie "Clockwork Orange"?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Well, they were my droogies, Della.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Chances are they would of turned on me anyway, just like in the movie.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	None of them was real ass outlaw. No, not in the way you are. You're the real deal, lady.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	I was already thinking about cutting some of em loose, getting a new style posse together.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	How's about it, you and me?
F	DELLA	Give me a break.
M	CHUCKIE	Monday night mechanics. Tuesday Pilates. Wednesday Spanish. Thursday, I wish.... Face it, Della. You ain't no suburban housewife.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	So you bought into the big lie, even tried to live it. Who could blame you? Husband, kids, security, every woman's dream, but not yours, Della. You know there ain't no such thing as security. But I'm betting you didn't really know who you were until tonight. I reckon I know what you've been dreaming about though, what you've been aching for, through all these lonely, wasted years. Blasting out of Podunk without never looking back. Feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers. Doing all the things they told you you ain't supposed to do. Taking what YOU want from life. And wasting anyone who stands in your way. Right, Della?
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Don't say you ain't thought about it. If it's in your blood, it's in your blood for all time.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	You had yourself fooled, Della.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Shit, lady, you took my whole crew out with nothing but a bunch of them tools. You can't go back to your old life. No way. It's all over for that. Kaboom.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	Hooking up with me's about the best chance you got. I bet you're on the outs with your old man.
M	CHUCKIE (CONT'D)	When we pick up your kids, we can waste him if you like.
