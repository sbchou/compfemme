M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	OLD SALIERI	Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me! Forgive your assassin! Mozart!
M	OLD SALIERI	Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg you! Show mercy to a guilty man!
M	VALET	Open the door, Signore! Please! Be good now! We've brought you something special. Something you're going to love.
M	VALET	Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come now. Be good!
M	OLD SALIERI	Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen! I confess!
M	OLD SALIERI	Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any longer! I confess! I confess what I did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir I confess! I killed you!
M	OLD SALIERI	Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your assassin! Pietˆ! Pietˆ! Forgive your assassin! Forgive me! Forgive! Forgive!
M	VALET	That's all right, Signore! He heard you! He forgave you! He wants you to go inside now and shut the window!
M	VALET	Come on, Signore! Look what I have for you! I can't give it to you from down here, can I?
M	BYSTANDER	Who is that?
M	VALET	No one, sir. He'll be all right. Poor man. He's a little unhappy, you know.
M	VALET	Did he open?
M	VALET	Here I am, Signore. Now open the door.
M	VALET	Mmmm - this is good! This is the most delicious thing I ever ate, believe me! Signore, you don't know what you're missing! Mmmm!
M	VALET	Now that's enough, Signore! Open!
M	VALET	If you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything. There'll be nothing left for you. And I'm not going to bring you anything more.
M	DOCTOR GULDEN	He's going to live. It's much harder to cut your throat than most people imagine.
M	DOCTOR GULDEN	Here we are. Do you wish me to come in with you?
M	VOGLER	No, Doctor. Thank you.
M	VOGLER	Herr Salieri?
M	OLD SALIERI	What do you want?
M	VOGLER	I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
M	OLD SALIERI	About what?
M	VOGLER	You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
M	OLD SALIERI	So?
M	VOGLER	In the sight of God that is a sin.
M	OLD SALIERI	What do you want?
M	VOGLER	Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
M	OLD SALIERI	Leave me alone.
M	VOGLER	I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
M	OLD SALIERI	Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
M	VOGLER	That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
M	OLD SALIERI	Are they?
M	VOGLER	Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
M	OLD SALIERI	I do not seek forgiveness.
M	VOGLER	My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
M	OLD SALIERI	How well are you trained in music?
M	VOGLER	I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
M	OLD SALIERI	Where?
M	VOGLER	Here in Vienna.
M	OLD SALIERI	Then you must know this.
M	VOGLER	I can't say I do. What is it?
M	OLD SALIERI	I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
M	OLD SALIERI	This one brought down the house when we played it first.
M	OLD SALIERI	Well?
M	VOGLER	I regret it is not too familiar.
M	OLD SALIERI	Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
M	VOGLER	Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that.
M	OLD SALIERI	I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
M	VOGLER	Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
M	OLD SALIERI	Ah - you've heard that?
M	VOGLER	All Vienna has heard that.
M	OLD SALIERI	And do they believe it?
M	VOGLER	Is it true?
M	OLD SALIERI	Do you believe it?
M	VOGLER	Should I?
M	VOGLER	For God's sake, my son, if you have anything to confess, do it now! Give yourself some peace!
M	VOGLER	Do you hear me?
M	OLD SALIERI	He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
M	VOGLER	Yes? Did you do it?
M	OLD SALIERI	He was my idol! I can't remember a time when I didn't know his name! When I was only fourteen he was already famous. Even in Legnago - the tiniest town in Italy - I knew of him.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	I was still playing childish games when he was playing music for kings and emperors. Even the Pope in Rome!
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	I admit I was jealous when I heard the tales they told about him. Not of the brilliant little prodigy himself, but of his father, who had taught him everything.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	My father did not care for music. He wanted me only to be a merchant, like himself. As anonymous as he was. When I told how I wished I could be like Mozart, he would say, Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey? Would you like me to drag you around Europe doing tricks like a circus freak? How could I tell him what music meant to me?
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	Even then a spray of sounded notes could make me dizzy, almost to falling. Whilst my father prayed earnestly to God to protect commerce, I would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of. Lord, make me a great composer! Let me celebrate your glory through music - and be celebrated myself! Make me famous through the world, dear God! Make me immortal! After I die let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote! In return I vow I will give you my chastity - my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life. And I will help my fellow man all I can. Amen and amen!
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	And do you know what happened? A miracle!
M	OLD SALIERI	Suddenly he was dead. Just like that! And my life changed forever. My mother said, Go. Study music if you really want to. Off with you! And off I went as quick as I could and never saw Italy again. Of course, I knew God had arranged it all; that was obvious. One moment I was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town. The next I was here, in Vienna, city of musicians, sixteen years old and studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father. Do you know who he was? The greatest composer of his time. And he loved me! That was the wonder. He taught me everything he knew. And when I was ready, introduced me personally to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the musical king! Within a few years I was his court composer. Wasn't that incredible? Imperial Composer to His Majesty! Actually the man had no ear at all, but what did it matter? He adored my music, that was enough. Night after night I sat right next to the Emperor of Austria, playing duets with him, correcting the royal sight-reading. Tell me, if you had been me, wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow? And believe me, I honoured it. I was a model of virtue. I kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians - work and work and work, that was all my life. And it was wonderful! Everybody liked me. I liked myself. I was the most successful musician in Vienna. And the happiest. Till he came. Mozart. One day he came to Vienna to play some of his music at the residence of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Eagerly I went there to seek him out. That night changed my life.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	As I went through the salon, I played a game with myself. This man had written his first concerto at the age of four; his first symphony at seven; a full-scale opera at twelve. Did it show? Is talent like that written on the face?
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	Which one of them could he be?
M	ARCO	Mozart is not here.
M	COLLOREDO	Where is he?
M	ARCO	They're looking for him, Your Grace.
M	COLLOREDO	We'll start without him.
F	MOZART	Miaouw! Miaouw! Mouse-wouse? It's Puss-wuss, fangs-wangs. Paws-claws. Pounce-bounce!
F	CONSTANZE	Stop it. Stop it!
F	CONSTANZE	Stop it!
F	MOZART	I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
F	CONSTANZE	No! No! No!
F	MOZART	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
F	CONSTANZE	Where?
F	MOZART	We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
F	CONSTANZE	Fartsbishop!
F	CONSTANZE	Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
F	MOZART	Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
F	CONSTANZE	Why not?
F	MOZART	Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
F	CONSTANZE	That's stupid.
F	MOZART	Why? People fart backwards.
F	CONSTANZE	Do you think that's funny?
F	MOZART	Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
F	CONSTANZE	Oh, ha, ha, ha.
F	MOZART	Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
F	CONSTANZE	Yes, you are. You're very sick.
F	MOZART	No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
F	CONSTANZE	Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
F	MOZART	Em iram! Em iram!
F	CONSTANZE	No, I'm not playing this game.
F	MOZART	No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
F	CONSTANZE	No!
F	MOZART	Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram!
F	CONSTANZE	Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
F	MOZART	Ui-vol-i-tub!
F	CONSTANZE	Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
F	MOZART	Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
F	CONSTANZE	What?
F	MOZART	Tish-I'm-tee.
F	CONSTANZE	Eat
F	MOZART	Yes.
F	CONSTANZE	Eat my - ah!
F	MOZART	My music! They've started! They've started without me!
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	So that was he! That giggling, dirty- minded creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor. Mozart. The phenomenon whose legend had haunted my youth. Impossible.
M	ARCO	Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
F	MOZART	Certainly!
F	MOZART	Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
M	ARCO	Indeed.
F	MOZART	These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
M	ARCO	His Grace is very angry with you.
F	MOZART	What do you mean?
M	ARCO	You are to come in here and ask his pardon.
M	ARCO	Your Grace.
M	COLLOREDO	Ah, Mozart. Why?
F	MOZART	Why what, sir?
M	COLLOREDO	Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
F	MOZART	Humiliated?
M	COLLOREDO	How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
F	MOZART	If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
M	COLLOREDO	I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
F	MOZART	No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
M	COLLOREDO	Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now. Extraordinary! On the page it looked nothing. The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox. Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God.
F	MOZART	Excuse me! But why?
M	OLD SALIERI	Why? Would God choose an obscene child to be His instrument? It was not to be believed! This piece had to be an accident. It had to be!
M	JOSEPH	How good is he, this Mozart?
M	VON SWIETEN	He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month. Idomeneo, King of Crete.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	That? A most tiresome piece. I heard it, too.
M	VON SWIETEN	Tiresome?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities. Too much spice. Too many notes.
M	VON SWIETEN	Majesty, I thought it the most promising work I've heard in years.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
M	VON STRACK	I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
M	JOSEPH	Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
M	VON SWIETEN	Excellent, sire!
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	But not German, I beg your Majesty! Italian is the proper language for opera. All educated people agree on that.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
M	VON STRACK	In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Kapellmeister?
M	BONNO	Majesty, I must agree with Herr Dirretore. Opera is an Italian art, solamente. German is - scusate - too bruta for singing, too rough.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Court Composer, what do you say?
M	SALIERI	I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
M	JOSEPH	You are cattivo, Court Composer. I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
M	VON STRACK	Yes, sir.
M	JOSEPH	Well. There it is.
M	SALIERI	Si.
M	SALIERI	Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
M	LORL	Good morning, sir.
M	SALIERI	What have you got for me today? Let me see.
M	SALIERI	Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
M	LORL	I will, sir.
M	SALIERI	Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
M	LORL	Yes, thank you, sir.
M	SALIERI	Bene! Bene!
M	SALIERI	Grazie, Signore.
F	MOZART	And the other one?
F	MOZART	And the other one?
F	MOZART	Oh, they're both so beautiful, I can't decide. Why don't I have two heads?
M	JOSEPH	Good, good, good.
M	JOSEPH	Good morning, gentlemen.
M	JOSEPH	Well, what do you have for me today?
M	VON STRACK	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
M	JOSEPH	Yes, what about him?
M	VON STRACK	He's here.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
M	SALIERI	Majesty, I hope you won't think it improper, but I have written a little March of Welcome in his honour.
M	JOSEPH	What a charming idea. May I see?
M	SALIERI	It's just a trifle, of course.
M	JOSEPH	May I try it?
M	SALIERI	Majesty.
M	JOSEPH	Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
M	SALIERI	You do me too much honour, Sire.
M	JOSEPH	Let's have some fun. Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
M	SALIERI	A-flat, Majesty.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha!
M	MAJORDOMO	Herr Mozart.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Bravo, Your Majesty!
M	VON STRACK	Well done, Sire!
M	JOSEPH	Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less enthusiasm, I beg you. Ah, Mozart.
F	MOZART	Your Majesty!
M	JOSEPH	No, no, please! It is not a holy relic. You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old. He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
M	JOSEPH	You know all these gentlemen, I'm sure.
M	JOSEPH	The Baron Von Swieten.
M	VON SWIETEN	I'm a great admirer of yours, young man. Welcome.
F	MOZART	Oh, thank you.
M	JOSEPH	The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
F	MOZART	Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
M	JOSEPH	And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
M	SALIERI	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
F	MOZART	I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
M	SALIERI	Really?
F	MOZART	Mio caro Adone.
M	SALIERI	Ah!
F	MOZART	A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
M	JOSEPH	And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
F	MOZART	Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
M	SALIERI	My pleasure.
M	JOSEPH	Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
F	MOZART	Majesty!
M	JOSEPH	Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
M	VON STRACK	Did we?
M	VON SWIETEN	I don't think it was really decided, Director.
F	MOZART	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
M	JOSEPH	Why so?
F	MOZART	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Oh? Have I seen it?
F	MOZART	I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	I think you'd better.
M	JOSEPH	Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
F	MOZART	It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a -
M	JOSEPH	Yes, where?
F	MOZART	In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You mean in Turkey?
F	MOZART	Exactly.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Then why especially does it have to be in German?
F	MOZART	Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
M	VON SWIETEN	My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
F	MOZART	Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent! It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
M	JOSEPH	Well, I'm glad to hear that.
M	SALIERI	Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
M	JOSEPH	Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
F	MOZART	Love, Sire!
M	SALIERI	Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
F	MOZART	No, I don't think you do. I mean watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching. Stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about! That's not love - it's just rubbish.
F	MOZART	Majesty, you choose the language. It will be my task to set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.
M	JOSEPH	Well, there it is. Let it be German.
M	JOSEPH	Ah, this is yours.
F	MOZART	Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
M	JOSEPH	What? On one hearing only?
F	MOZART	I think so, Sire, yes.
M	JOSEPH	Show me.
F	MOZART	The rest is just the same, isn't it?
F	MOZART	That really doesn't work, does it?
F	MOZART	Did you try this? Wouldn't it be just a little more -?
F	MOZART	Or this - yes, this! Better.
M	SALIERI	Grazie, Signore.
M	SALIERI	Yes?
M	LORL	Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
M	SALIERI	Bene.
M	CAVALIERI	Maestro.
M	SALIERI	Good morning.
M	CAVALIERI	Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
M	SALIERI	Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
M	CAVALIERI	Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
M	SALIERI	Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
M	CAVALIERI	And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
M	SALIERI	Yes.
M	CAVALIERI	Is there a part for me?
M	SALIERI	No.
M	CAVALIERI	How do you know?
M	SALIERI	Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
M	CAVALIERI	Why not?
M	SALIERI	Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
M	CAVALIERI	Where?
M	SALIERI	In a harem.
M	CAVALIERI	What's that?
M	SALIERI	A brothel.
M	CAVALIERI	Oh!
M	SALIERI	A Turkish brothel.
M	CAVALIERI	Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
M	SALIERI	My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
M	CAVALIERI	Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
M	SALIERI	Perhaps.
M	CAVALIERI	What does he look like?
M	SALIERI	You might be disappointed.
M	CAVALIERI	Why?
M	SALIERI	Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
M	CAVALIERI	Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
M	CAVALIERI	Since you are determined, Since you are determined, Calmly, with no ferment, Welcome - every pain and woe. Bind me then - compel me! Bind me then - compel me! Hurt me. Break me! Kill me! At last I shall be freed by death! There she was. I had no idea where they met - or how - yet there she stood on stage for all to see. Showing off like the greedy songbird she was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios, whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.
M	CAVALIERI	Be freed at last by death! Be freed at last by death! At last I shall be freed By! Death!
M	OLD SALIERI	Understand, I was in love with the girl. Or at least in lust. I wasn't a saint. It took me the most tremendous effort to be faithful to my vow. I swear to you I never laid a finger on her. All the same, I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her - least of all the Creature.
M	CAST OF SERAGLIO	Pasha Selim May he Live forever! Ever, ever, ever, ever! Honour to his regal name! Honour to his regal name! May his noble brow emblazon Glory, fortune, joy and fame! Honour be to Pasha Selim Honour to his regal name! Honour to his regal name!
M	JOSEPH	Bravo, Madame. You are an ornament to our stage.
M	CAVALIERI	Majesty.
M	JOSEPH	And to you, Court Composer. Your pupil has done you great credit.
M	MADAME WEBER	Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
M	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
M	MADAME WEBER	Do you know who I am? This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
M	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
M	MADAME WEBER	Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
F	CONSTANZE	Mother, please!
M	MADAME WEBER	Go ahead, Constanze. Just ignore this fellow. Go ahead, dear!
M	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
M	MADAME WEBER	Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
M	JOSEPH	Well, Herr Mozart! A good effort. Decidedly that. An excellent effort! You've shown us something quite new today.
F	MOZART	It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
M	JOSEPH	Yes, indeed.
F	MOZART	And German?
M	JOSEPH	Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
F	MOZART	So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
M	JOSEPH	Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
F	MOZART	What do you mean, Sire?
M	JOSEPH	Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? How shall one say, Director?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Too many notes, Your Majesty?
M	JOSEPH	Exactly. Very well put. Too many notes.
F	MOZART	I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
M	JOSEPH	My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
M	SALIERI	Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, Majesty.
F	MOZART	But this is absurd!
M	JOSEPH	My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
F	MOZART	Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
M	JOSEPH	Well. There it is.
M	MADAME WEBER	Wolfi! Wolfi, my dear!
M	MADAME WEBER	Oh!
F	MOZART	Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
M	JOSEPH	Enchanted, Madame.
M	MADAME WEBER	Oh, Sire! such an honour! And, and, and these are my dear daughters. This is Constanze. She is the fiancee of Herr Mozart.
M	JOSEPH	Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
F	MOZART	Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
M	JOSEPH	Excuse me, but how old are you?
F	MOZART	Twenty-six.
M	JOSEPH	Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
M	MADAME WEBER	You see? You see? I've told him that, Your Majesty, but he won't listen to me.
M	MADAME WEBER	Oh, Your Majesty, you give such wonderful - such impeccable - such royal advice. I - I - May I?
M	JOSEPH	Well. There it is. Strack.
F	CONSTANZE	Get some water!
F	MOZART	Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
M	CAVALIERI	Don't bother!
F	MOZART	What?
M	CAVALIERI	Don't bother.
F	MOZART	I'll be right back.
F	CONSTANZE	Are you all right?
M	MADAME WEBER	Ah, what an evening! What a wise man we have for an Emperor. Oh, my children! Now I want you to write your father exactly what His Majesty said.
F	MOZART	You should really go home now, Frau Weber. Your carriage must be waiting.
M	MADAME WEBER	But aren't you taking us?
F	MOZART	I have to talk to the singers.
M	MADAME WEBER	That's all right; we'll wait for you. Just don't take all night.
M	CAVALIERI	Did you know? Had you heard?
M	SALIERI	What?
M	CAVALIERI	The marriage!
M	SALIERI	Well, what does it matter to you?
M	CAVALIERI	Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
M	CAVALIERI	How was I? Tell me honestly.
M	SALIERI	You were sublime.
M	CAVALIERI	What did you think of the music?
M	SALIERI	Extremely clever.
M	CAVALIERI	Meaning you didn't like it.
F	MOZART	Oh - excuse me!
M	CAVALIERI	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
F	MOZART	No, she's fine.
M	CAVALIERI	I'm so relieved.
M	SALIERI	Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
F	MOZART	Did you like it, then?
M	SALIERI	How could I not?
F	MOZART	It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
M	CAVALIERI	Is she a good fuck?
F	MOZART	What??
M	CAVALIERI	I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
M	CAVALIERI	Come in!
F	CONSTANZE	Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
F	MOZART	Of course.
M	CAVALIERI	No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
F	MOZART	Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
M	CAVALIERI	You really are full of surprises, aren't you? You are quite extraordinary, you little shit!
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	At that moment I knew beyond any doubt. He'd had her. The Creature had had my darling girl.
M	OLD SALIERI	It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
M	VOGLER	Did you try?
M	OLD SALIERI	Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
M	SALIERI	Please! Please! Send him away, back to Salzburg. For his sake as well as mine.
M	COLLOREDO	No! I won't have him back. But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
M	COLLOREDO	Hardly.
M	LEOPOLD	Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
M	COLLOREDO	I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
M	LEOPOLD	Sir -
M	COLLOREDO	Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
M	LEOPOLD	Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
M	COLLOREDO	And how will you make him keep it?
M	LEOPOLD	Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
M	COLLOREDO	You have leave to try.
M	LEOPOLD	Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
M	LEOPOLD (V.O.)	My dear son.
M	LEOPOLD (V.O.)	I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
F	MOZART	I will.
M	PRIEST	And will you, Constanze Weber, take this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful husband?
F	CONSTANZE	I will.
M	PRIEST	I now pronounce you man and wife.
M	MOZART (V.O.)	Most beloved father, it is done. Do not blame me that I did not wait to see your dear face. I knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and I could not have borne it. Your every word is precious to me. Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians. To conquer here is to conquer Europe! With my wife I can do it. I vow I will become regular in my habits and productive as never before. She is wonderful, Papa, and I know that you will love her. And one day soon when I am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy. I long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times.
M	JOSEPH	Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
M	SALIERI	Your Highness.
M	JOSEPH	She has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor. I think I've come up with an excellent idea.
M	SALIERI	Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
M	JOSEPH	I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
M	SALIERI	An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
M	JOSEPH	Yes?
M	SALIERI	You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
M	JOSEPH	And the result satisfies.
M	SALIERI	Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
M	SALIERI	I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
M	JOSEPH	You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
M	SALIERI	Sire.
M	JOSEPH	Well. There it is.
F	MOZART	What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
M	VON STRACK	What is what?
F	MOZART	Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
M	VON STRACK	Because His Majesty wishes it.
F	MOZART	Is the Emperor angry with me?
M	VON STRACK	On the contrary.
F	MOZART	Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
M	VON STRACK	Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
F	MOZART	No, but I'm the best.
M	VON STRACK	A little modesty would suit you better.
F	MOZART	Who is on this committee?
M	VON STRACK	Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
F	MOZART	Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
M	VON STRACK	Mozart -
F	MOZART	They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
M	VON STRACK	Mozart -
F	MOZART	Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
M	VON STRACK	Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
F	MOZART	Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
F	CONSTANZE	I think you're mad! You're really mad!
F	MOZART	Oh, leave me alone.
F	CONSTANZE	One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
F	MOZART	They'll come anyway. They love me here.
F	CONSTANZE	No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
F	MOZART	Oh yes? You always know everything.
F	CONSTANZE	Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
F	MOZART	You borrowed money from your mother?
F	CONSTANZE	Yes!
F	MOZART	Well, don't do that again!
F	CONSTANZE	How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
F	MOZART	Don't be stupid.
F	CONSTANZE	All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
F	MOZART	Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
F	CONSTANZE	This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
M	SALIERI	Yes.
M	SERVANT	Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
M	SALIERI	Who is she?
M	SERVANT	She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
M	SALIERI	Excuse me, my dear.
F	CONSTANZE	Excellency!
M	SALIERI	Madame. How can I help you?
M	SALIERI	Frau Mozart?
F	CONSTANZE	That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
M	SALIERI	How charming. But why did he not come himself?
F	CONSTANZE	He's terribly busy, sir.
M	SALIERI	I understand.
M	SALIERI	I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
F	CONSTANZE	Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
M	SALIERI	I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
F	CONSTANZE	I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
M	SALIERI	Really?
F	CONSTANZE	My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
M	SALIERI	Then he didn't send you?
F	CONSTANZE	No, sir. This is my own idea.
M	SALIERI	I see.
F	CONSTANZE	Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
M	SALIERI	Let me offer you some refreshment. Do you know what these are?
M	SALIERI	Cappezzoli di Venere. Nipples of Venus. Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. Won't you try one? They're quite surprising.
F	CONSTANZE	Oh! They're wonderful.
F	CONSTANZE	Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
M	SALIERI	Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
M	SALIERI	Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
F	CONSTANZE	That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
M	SALIERI	Originals?
F	CONSTANZE	Yes.
M	SALIERI	These are originals?
F	CONSTANZE	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
M	OLD SALIERI	Astounding! It was actually beyond belief. These were first and only drafts of music yet they showed no corrections of any kind. Not one. Do you realize what that meant?
M	OLD SALIERI	He'd simply put down music already finished in his head. Page after page of it, as if he was just taking dictation. And music finished as no music is ever finished.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall. It was clear to me. That sound I had heard in the Archbishop's palace had been no accident. Here again was the very voice of God! I was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink- strokes at an absolute, inimitable beauty.
F	CONSTANZE	Is it no good?
M	SALIERI	It is miraculous.
F	CONSTANZE	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
F	CONSTANZE	So, will you help him?
M	SALIERI	Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
F	CONSTANZE	Oh, thank you, sir!
M	SALIERI	Come back tonight.
F	CONSTANZE	Tonight?
M	SALIERI	Alone.
F	CONSTANZE	What for?
M	SALIERI	Some service deserves service in return. No?
F	CONSTANZE	What do you mean?
M	SALIERI	Isn't it obvious?
M	SALIERI	It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
F	CONSTANZE	But! I'm a married woman!
M	SALIERI	Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
M	SALIERI	Yes.
M	OLD SALIERI	Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
M	VOGLER	You cannot say that!
M	OLD SALIERI	No? Was Mozart a good man?
M	VOGLER	God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
M	OLD SALIERI	All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
M	VOGLER	My son, no one can speak for God.
M	OLD SALIERI	Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
M	VOGLER	I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
M	OLD SALIERI	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers! There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	Evening came to that room. I sat there not knowing whether the girl would return or not. I prayed as I'd never prayed before.
M	SALIERI	Dear God, enter me now. Fill me with one piece of true music. One piece with your breath in it, so I know that you love me. Please. Just one. Show me one sign of your favour, and I will show mine to Mozart and his wife. I will get him the royal position, and if she comes, I'll receive her with all respect and send her home in joy. Enter me! Enter me! Please! Te imploro.
M	SERVANT	That lady is back, sir.
M	SALIERI	Show her in. Then go to bed.
F	CONSTANZE	Well, I'm here. My husband has gone to a concert. He didn't think I would enjoy it.
F	CONSTANZE	I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
M	SALIERI	What?
F	CONSTANZE	Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfgang was given some candlesticks by King George in England, but they were only wood. Oh, excuse me. Let's not talk about him. What do you think of this? It's real lace. Brussels.
F	CONSTANZE	Well, it's much too good for every day. I keep saying to Wolfi, don't be so extravagant. Presents are lovely, but we can't afford them. It doesn't do any good. The more I tell him, the more he spends. Oh, excuse me! There I go again.
F	CONSTANZE	Do you still want to look at this? Or don't we need to bother anymore? I imagine we don't, really.
M	SALIERI	Go! Go! Go!
M	SALIERI	Show this woman out!
F	CONSTANZE	You shit! You shit! You rotten shit!
F	CONSTANZE	What are you staring at?
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	From now on, we are enemies, You and I!
M	OLD SALIERI	Because You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You! I swear it! I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able. I will ruin Your Incarnation.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	What use after all is Man, if not to teach God His lessons?
F	MOZART	Stanzi! Stanzi! Stanzi-Manzi!
F	MOZART	Sssh!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
F	MOZART	Sssh! Stay here.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Sssh! You're dishgrashful!
F	MOZART	Stanzi? How's my mouse? Mouse-wouse? I'm back - puss-wuss is back!
F	MOZART	Stanzi!
F	MOZART	What's the matter? What is it? Stanzi!
F	MOZART	Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
F	CONSTANZE	Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
F	MOZART	What's the matter with you?
F	CONSTANZE	Tell them to go!
F	MOZART	Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
F	CONSTANZE	No!
F	MOZART	Yes!
F	CONSTANZE	I love you! I love you!
F	CONSTANZE	I love you. Please stay with me. I'm frightened.
M	JOSEPH	I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
M	SALIERI	Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
M	JOSEPH	Why not?
M	SALIERI	Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
M	JOSEPH	Oh?
M	SALIERI	Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
M	JOSEPH	Of course not.
M	SALIERI	I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
M	JOSEPH	Really?
M	SALIERI	As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
M	JOSEPH	Yes?
M	SALIERI	Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well. There it is.
M	SERVANT	Sir, there is a Herr Mozart waiting for you in the salon.
M	SALIERI	What does he want?
M	SERVANT	He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
M	SALIERI	Come with me. And stay in the room.
M	SALIERI	Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
F	MOZART	Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
M	SALIERI	So you are. How is your pretty wife?
F	MOZART	She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
M	SALIERI	I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
F	MOZART	So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
M	SALIERI	Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
F	MOZART	Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
M	SALIERI	I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
F	MOZART	Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
M	SALIERI	My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
F	MOZART	Whom did they choose?
M	SALIERI	Herr Sommer.
F	MOZART	Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
M	SALIERI	No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
F	MOZART	But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
M	SALIERI	An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
F	MOZART	Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
M	SALIERI	You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
F	MOZART	No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
M	SALIERI	It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
F	MOZART	How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
M	SALIERI	How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
F	MOZART	They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
M	SALIERI	Of course not.
F	MOZART	Do you have a daughter?
M	SALIERI	I'm afraid not.
F	MOZART	Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
M	SALIERI	Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
F	MOZART	I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
M	SALIERI	Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
F	MOZART	Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
M	SALIERI	Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
F	MOZART	Ah. Italian?
M	SALIERI	Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
F	MOZART	Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
M	SALIERI	What exactly are you working on?
F	MOZART	I can't say. Really
M	SALIERI	I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
M	SCHLUMBERG	Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you. Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
F	MOZART	And which one of them do you want me to teach?
M	SCHLUMBERG	What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow. Hannah! Come this way.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Hannah!
M	SCHLUMBERG	You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
F	MOZART	Madame.
M	SCHLUMBERG	This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Upstairs.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Gertrude!
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	You can't be Herr Mozart!
F	MOZART	I'm afraid I am.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Gertrude!
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
M	SCHLUMBERG	People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
F	MOZART	Really?
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Ah, now! Here she comes.
F	MOZART	Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
F	MOZART	I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Wine? Quite right. He's going to need it. Klaus! A bottle of wine. Prestissimo! Now let's go to it. I've been waiting all day for this.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Now sit down all of you and behave. Zeman, Mandi, absolutely quiet! Especially you, Dudelsachs - not one sound from you.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Come on, then. Up and at it!
F	MOZART	Now, please play me something. Just to give me an idea. Anything will do.
F	GERTRUDE	I don't want you to stay.
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	That's all right, dear. Just go ahead, as if we weren't here.
F	GERTRUDE	But you are here.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
F	MOZART	Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Just one year.
F	MOZART	Who was your teacher?
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
F	MOZART	Thank you, Madame. Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
F	MOZART	Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone. I think we're both a little shy.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Nonsense. Strudel's not shy. She's just willful! You give into her now, you'll be sorry later. Strudel - play.
M	SCHLUMBERG	I said play!
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Michael!
F	MOZART	Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein. Why don't you let me try the instrument? All right?
M	SCHLUMBERG	Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at once! Don't let him disturb you. He'll be all right. He's just a little willful too. Please, please - play. I beg you.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Stop it! STOP!
M	SCHLUMBERG	No, not you. I was talking to the dog. You keep playing. It's most important. He always howls when he hears music. We've got to break them of the habit. Play, please. Please!
M	SCHLUMBERG	That's it. Now keep going, just keep going. Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, you stop it this instant! This instant, do you hear me? Keep going, Herr Mozart, that's it. Go on, go on!
M	SCHLUMBERG	Good, good, good! Very good dog! Very, very good Dudelsachs. Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Now guess who's going to get a nice reward? Clever, clever Dudi.
M	SCHLUMBERG	It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
F	MOZART	Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
M	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	What a strange young man.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Yes. He is a little strange.
F	MOZART	Papa! PAPA!
F	MOZART	Why are you here?
M	LEOPOLD	Am I not welcome?
F	MOZART	Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
M	LEOPOLD	You're very thin. Does she not feed you, this wife of yours?
F	MOZART	Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
M	LEOPOLD	Is she not here?
F	MOZART	I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
M	LEOPOLD	Do you always live like this?
F	MOZART	Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
F	MOZART	Oh! I didn't know you were home. Stanzi, this is my father.
F	MOZART	We'll wait, we'll wait. Why don't you get up now, darling?
F	MOZART	She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
M	LEOPOLD	Don't you have a maid?
F	MOZART	Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
M	LEOPOLD	How is your financial situation?
F	MOZART	It couldn't be better.
M	LEOPOLD	That's not what I hear.
F	MOZART	What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
M	LEOPOLD	They say you're in debt.
F	MOZART	Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
M	LEOPOLD	How many pupils do you have?
F	MOZART	Pupils?
M	LEOPOLD	Yes.
F	MOZART	Yes.
M	LEOPOLD	How many?
F	MOZART	I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
M	LEOPOLD	Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
F	MOZART	This one will.
M	LEOPOLD	What's that?
F	MOZART	Oh, let's not talk about it.
M	LEOPOLD	Why not?
F	MOZART	It's a secret.
M	LEOPOLD	You don't have secrets from me.
F	MOZART	It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
F	MOZART	My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
F	CONSTANZE	Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
F	MOZART	He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
M	LEOPOLD	I see that you're expecting.
F	CONSTANZE	Oh, yes.
M	LEOPOLD	When, may I ask?
F	CONSTANZE	In three months! Papa.
F	MOZART	Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
M	LEOPOLD	Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
F	MOZART	Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
F	CONSTANZE	May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
F	MOZART	Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi!
F	MOZART	What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
M	LEOPOLD	Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
F	MOZART	Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
M	SCHIKANEDER	No, no! You both lost. You both lost. You both have to forfeit. And the penalty is you must exchange your wigs.
M	LEOPOLD	No, please! This is ridiculous! No, please!
M	LEOPOLD	No, really!
F	MOZART	This is just a game, Papa.
F	CONSTANZE	This is just a game, Papa!
M	BYSTANDERS	This is just a game, Papa!
F	MOZART	Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the fun. Come on. Here, take mine.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty?
F	MOZART	Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
M	LEOPOLD	I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
M	SCHIKANEDER	What did he say? What did he say?
F	MOZART	Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
M	LEOPOLD	I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
F	MOZART	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
M	SCHIKANEDER	I've got a good one. I've got the perfect one for you. Come over here.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Now, I want you to play our tune - sitting backwards.
F	MOZART	Oh, that's really too easy. Any child can do that.
M	SCHIKANEDER	And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach.
M	GUESTS	Another! Do another! Someone else.
F	MOZART	Give me a name. Who shall I do? Give me a name.
M	GUESTS	Gluck! Haydn! Frederic Handel!
F	CONSTANZE	Salieri! Do Salieri!
F	MOZART	Now that's hard. That's very hard. For Salieri one has to face the right way around.
M	OLD SALIERI	Go on. Mock me. Laugh, laugh!
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	That was not Mozart laughing, Father. That was God. That was God! God laughing at me through that obscene giggle. Go on, Signore. Laugh. Rub my nose in it. Show my mediocrity for all to see. You wait! I will laugh at You! Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at You! Amen!
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi! Wolfgang!
F	MOZART	What is it?
F	CONSTANZE	There's a young girl to see you.
F	MOZART	What does she want?
F	CONSTANZE	I don't know.
F	MOZART	Well, ask her!
F	CONSTANZE	She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
F	MOZART	Oh, damn!
F	MOZART	Yes?
M	LORL	Are you Herr Mozart?
F	MOZART	That's right.
M	LORL	My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
F	MOZART	What?
M	LORL	They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
F	CONSTANZE	What do you mean? What admirer?
M	LORL	I can't tell you that, ma'am.
F	MOZART	Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
M	LORL	Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
F	MOZART	Papa, is this your idea?
M	LEOPOLD	Mine?
F	MOZART	Are you playing a trick on me?
M	LEOPOLD	I never saw this girl in my life. Is this a kind of joke?
M	LORL	Not at all, sir. And I was told to wait for an answer.
M	LEOPOLD	Young woman, this won't do at all. My son can't possibly accept such an offer, no matter how generous, unless he knows who is behind it.
M	LORL	But I really can't tell you, sir.
M	LEOPOLD	Oh, this is ridiculous.
F	CONSTANZE	What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
M	LEOPOLD	But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
F	CONSTANZE	Well, this is none of your business. Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
M	LORL	That's right, ma'am.
M	LEOPOLD	So now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house?
F	CONSTANZE	Who is we? Who is letting who? Could you please wait outside?
M	LORL	Yes, ma'am.
F	CONSTANZE	Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
F	MOZART	Stanzi!
F	CONSTANZE	No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
M	LEOPOLD	Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
F	MOZART	Papa!
M	LEOPOLD	Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
F	MOZART	No one calls you that.
M	LEOPOLD	She does. She says I sleep all day.
F	CONSTANZE	And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
M	LEOPOLD	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
F	CONSTANZE	Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
M	LEOPOLD	So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
F	CONSTANZE	Do you hear him? Do you?
F	CONSTANZE	When can you start?
M	LORL	Right away, ma'am.
F	CONSTANZE	Good! Come in. You'll start with that room there. It's filthy!
M	LEOPOLD	Sorry, sorry! I'm sorry I spoke! I'm just a provincial from Salzburg. What do I know about smart Vienna? Parties all night, every night. Dancing and drinking like idiot children!
M	LEOPOLD (O.S.)	Dinner at eight! Dinner at ten! Dinner when anyone feels like it! If anyone feels like it!
M	LORL	They're out every night, sir. Till all hours.
M	LORL	Oh, thank you, sir.
M	SALIERI	Do any pupils come to the house?
M	LORL	Not that I've seen.
M	SALIERI	Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
M	LORL	Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
M	SALIERI	Really? What is it he's writing?
M	LORL	Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
M	SALIERI	Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
M	LORL	Oh, thank you, sir!
M	LORL	I think I've found out about the money, sir.
M	SALIERI	Yes what?
M	LORL	He kept seven snuff boxes in here. I could swear they were all gold. And now look there's only one left. And inside, sir, look - I counted them - tickets from the pawnshop. Six of them.
M	SALIERI	Where does he work?
M	LORL	In there, sir.
M	JOSEPH	Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
F	MOZART	Thank you, Sire!
M	VON SWIETEN	Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
F	MOZART	Baron!
F	MOZART	Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
M	JOSEPH	What is it?
F	MOZART	May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
M	JOSEPH	Ah! By all means.
M	LEOPOLD	Your Majesty.
M	JOSEPH	Good evening. We have met before, Herr Mozart.
M	LEOPOLD	That's right, Your Majesty. Twenty years ago. No, twenty-two! twenty- three! And I remember word for word what you said to me. You said - you said --
M	JOSEPH	Bravo?
M	LEOPOLD	No! Yes, 'bravo,' of course 'bravo'! Everybody always says 'bravo' when Wolfi plays. Like the King of England. When we played for the King of England, he got up at the end and said, 'Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!' three times. Three bravo's. And the Pope four! Four bravo's from the Holy Father, and one 'bellissimo.'
F	MOZART	Father -
M	LEOPOLD	Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
M	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well. There it is.
M	SALIERI	I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Yes?
M	SALIERI	Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Italian?
M	BONNO	Aie!
M	SALIERI	And that's not all. He has chosen for his subject, Figaro. The Marriage of Figaro.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You mean that play?
M	SALIERI	Exactly.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	He's setting that play to music?
M	SALIERI	Yes.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You must be mad.
M	BONNO	What is this Marriage of Figaro?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	It's a French play, Kapellmeister. It has been banned by the Emperor.
M	BONNO	Hah!
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Are you absolutely sure?
M	SALIERI	I've seen the manuscript.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Where?
M	SALIERI	Never mind.
M	VON STRACK	I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
M	VON STRACK	Oh yes, yes. And that was?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
M	VON STRACK	Ah.
M	LACKEY	Herr Mozart.
M	JOSEPH	Sit down, gentlemen, please.
M	JOSEPH	Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? Yes, Sire.
M	JOSEPH	Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
F	MOZART	Who told you this, Majesty?
M	JOSEPH	It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
F	MOZART	Well, yes, I admit it is.
M	JOSEPH	Would you tell me why?
F	MOZART	Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
F	MOZART	But, Your Majesty -
M	JOSEPH	Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
F	MOZART	Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
M	JOSEPH	I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
F	MOZART	But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
M	JOSEPH	Ah, love again.
F	MOZART	But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on. On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
M	JOSEPH	I have no idea.
F	MOZART	Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
M	JOSEPH	Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
F	MOZART	Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
M	VON SWIETEN	Mozart -
F	MOZART	Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
M	VON SWIETEN	Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish? Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
F	MOZART	Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
M	VON SWIETEN	Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
M	BONNO	Bello! Bello, Barone. Veramente.
F	MOZART	Oh, bello, bello, bello! Come on now, be honest. Wouldn't you all rather listen to your hairdressers than Hercules? Or Horatius? Or Orpheus? All those old bores! people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble!
M	VON SWIETEN	What?
M	VON STRACK	Govern your tongue, sir! How dare you?
F	MOZART	Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
M	JOSEPH	You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
F	MOZART	Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
M	BONNO	His Majesty has been more than patient, Signore.
F	MOZART	How can I persuade you if you won't let me show it?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	That will do, Herr Mozart!
F	MOZART	Just let me tell you how it begins.
M	VON STRACK	Herr Mozart -
F	MOZART	May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
M	JOSEPH	Please.
F	MOZART	Look! There's a servant, down on his knees. Do you know why? Not from any oppression. No, he's simply measuring a space. Do you know what for? His bed. His wedding bed to see if it will fit.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
M	SALIERI	Incredible.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	The Emperor has given him permission.
M	BONNO	Si, si! Veramente.
M	SALIERI	Well, gentlemen, so be it. In that case I think we should help Mozart all we can and do our best to protect him against the Emperor's anger.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	What anger?
M	SALIERI	About the ballet.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Ballet? What ballet?
M	SALIERI	Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
M	SALIERI	Yes, in the third act.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
F	MOZART	Certainly, Herr Director.
F	MOZART	Five minutes, please!
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
F	MOZART	Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Exactly. A dance.
F	MOZART	But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story. It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Thank you.
F	MOZART	What are you doing?
F	MOZART	What are you doing, Herr Director?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Taking out what you should never have put in.
M	SERVANT	Herr Mozart.
F	MOZART	Please! Please. I've no one else to turn to. Please!
M	SALIERI	Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
F	MOZART	It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
M	SALIERI	Really? Why?
F	MOZART	I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
M	SALIERI	Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
F	MOZART	Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
M	SALIERI	You burned the score?
F	MOZART	Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
M	SALIERI	How fortunate.
F	MOZART	It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
M	SALIERI	But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
F	MOZART	Oh, Excellency, would you?
M	SALIERI	With all my heart, Mozart.
F	MOZART	Thank you! Oh, thank you.
M	SALIERI	No, no, no, Herr Mozart, please. It's not a holy relic.
M	OLD SALIERI	I'm sure I don't need to tell you I said nothing whatever to the Emperor. I went to the theatre ready to tell Mozart that His Majesty had flown into a rage when I mentioned the ballet, when suddenly, to my astonishment, in the middle of the third act, the Emperor - who never attended rehearsals - suddenly appeared.
M	JOSEPH	What is this? I don't understand. Is it modern?
M	BONNO	Majesty, the Herr Director, he has removed a balleto that would have occurred at this place.
M	JOSEPH	Why?
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	It is your regulation, Sire. No ballet in your opera.
M	JOSEPH	Do you like this, Salieri?
M	SALIERI	It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
M	JOSEPH	Well, look at them.
M	JOSEPH	No, no, no! This is nonsense. Let me hear the scene with the music.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	But, Sire -
M	JOSEPH	Oblige me.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Yes, Majesty.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
F	MOZART	Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
F	MOZART	Ladies and gentlemen, we're going from where we stopped. The Count: Anches so. Right away, please!
M	JOSEPH	What I hoped by that edict, Director, was simply to prevent hours of dancing like in French opera. There it is endless, as you know.
M	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Quite so, Majesty.
M	OLD SALIERI	So Figaro was produced in spite of me. And in spite of me, a wonder was revealed. One of the true wonders of art. The restored third act was bold and brilliant. The fourth was a miracle.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	I saw a woman disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first tender words he has offered her in years, only because he thinks she is someone else. I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre, conferring on all who sat there a perfect absolution. God was singing through this little man to all the world - unstoppable - making my defeat more bitter with each passing bar.
M	OLD SALIERI	And then suddenly - a miracle!
M	OLD SALIERI	Father, did you know what that meant? With that yawn I saw my defeat turn into a victory. And Mozart was lucky the Emperor only yawned once. Three yawns and the opera would fail the same night; two yawns, within a week at most. With one yawn the composer could still get -
F	MOZART	Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
M	SALIERI	I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
F	MOZART	But what is it they don't like?
M	SALIERI	Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
F	MOZART	What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
M	SALIERI	I think it's marvelous. Truly.
F	MOZART	It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
M	SALIERI	I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
F	MOZART	I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
M	SALIERI	I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
F	MOZART	Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
M	SALIERI	Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
F	MOZART	Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	What was this? I never saw him excited before by any music but his own. Could he mean it?
M	OLD SALIERI	Would he actually tell me my music had moved him? Was I really going to hear that from his own lips? I found myself actually hurrying the tempo of the finale.
F	MOZART	Well?
M	SCHIKANEDER	Sublime! Utterly sublime!
F	MOZART	That kind of music should be punishable by death.
M	JOSEPH	I believe that is the best opera yet written, my friends. Salieri, you are the brightest star in the musical firmament. You do honour to Vienna and to me.
M	SALIERI	Mozart. It was good of you to come.
F	MOZART	How could I not?
M	SALIERI	Did my work please you?
F	MOZART	How could it not, Excellency?
M	SALIERI	Yes?
F	MOZART	I never knew that music like that was possible.
M	SALIERI	You flatter me.
F	MOZART	Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
F	MOZART	Oh. Everybody's here! We've got guests. Good. I've brought some more.
F	MOZART	We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl.
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi.
F	MOZART	Yes, my love?
F	CONSTANZE	These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
F	MOZART	Salzburg. We were just talking about Salzburg. If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi! Your father is dead.
F	MOZART	What?
F	CONSTANZE	Your father is dead.
M	THE COMMENDATORE	Don Giovanni!
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	So rose the dreadful ghost in his next and blackest opera. There on the stage stood the figure of a dead commander calling out 'Repent! Repent!'
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	And I knew - only I understood - that the horrifying apparition was Leopold, raised from the dead. Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world. It was terrifying and wonderful to watch.
M	OLD SALIERI	Now a madness began in me. The madness of a man splitting in half. Through my influence I saw to it Don Giovanni was played only five times in Vienna. But in secret I went to every one of those five - all alone - unable to help myself, worshipping sound I alone seemed to hear.
M	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	And hour after hour, as I stood there, understanding even more clearly how that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son from beyond the grave, I began to see a way - a terrible way - I could finally triumph over God, my torturer.
M	EMMANUEL SCHIKANEDER	Impresario de luxe PRESENTS The Celebrated SCHIKANEDER TROUPE OF PLAYERS IN PARODY Music! Mirth! Magic! ALL SONGS AND SPEECHES WRITTEN BY EMMANUEL SCHIKANEDER who personally will appear in every scene!

M	THREE LADIES	Don't hesitate a second. Just answer yes and neigh.
M	COMMENDATORE	Stop it. What are you doing? Remember who you are! You're a horse and they are whores.

M	SCHIKANEDER	Shut up. Women, women, women! I'm sick to death of them.
M	SOPRANO	Dash me! Bash me! Lash me! Flay me! Slay me! At last I will be freed by death!
M	COMMENDATORE	Shut up.
M	SOPRANO	Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! At last I shall be freed by death. At last I shall be freed by dea -
M	EIGHT DWARVES	We're going to make a soprano stew! We're going to make a soprano stew! And when you make a soprano stew! Any stupid soprano will do! Any stew- stew-stew-stew-stew! Any stewpid soprano will do!
M	FIRST LADY	Behold!
M	SECOND LADY	Behold!
M	THIRD LADY	Behold!
M	COMMENDATORE	How long does it take to cook a soprano?
M	DWARVES	Five hours, five minutes, five seconds.
M	COMMENDATORE	I can't wait that long. I'm starving!
M	OTTAVIO	So am I.
M	SCHIKANEDER	In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
M	COMMENDATORE	Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
M	THE THREE GIRLS	Give me your hoof, my darling, and I'll give you my heart.
M	COMMENDATORE	Shut up. I'm sick of that one too.
M	COMMENDATORE	And that one, too!
M	SOPRANO	Oil me! Broil me! Boil me!
M	SOPRANO	Soil me! Foil me! Spoil me!
M	HORSE	I can't eat her. Sopranos give me hiccups. I want some hay!
M	FIRST LADY	Hey!
M	SECOND LADY	Hey!
M	THIRD LADY	Hey!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Hey what?
M	ALL THREE LADIES	Give him some hay, my darling, and I'll give you my heart!
M	COMMENDATORE	Shut up.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Leporello! We want some hay - prestissimo! Leporello - where are you?
M	FIRST LADY	Behold!
M	SECOND LADY	Behold!
M	THIRD LADY	Behold!
M	COMMENDATORE	Hey! Hey! Watch out!
M	COMMENDATORE	Whoa! Whoa, Ottavio! Whoa!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Well, how do you like that?
F	MOZART	Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
M	SCHIKANEDER	Yes, well, it's all good fun.
F	MOZART	I liked the horse.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
F	MOZART	I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
M	SCHIKANEDER	'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
F	MOZART	Animals?
M	SCHIKANEDER	I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
M	SCHIKANEDER	I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
F	MOZART	German!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
F	MOZART	No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
M	SCHIKANEDER	So there you are. What do you say?
F	CONSTANZE	How much will you pay him?
M	SCHIKANEDER	Ah. Well. Ah, I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
F	MOZART	Half the receipts! Stanzi!
F	CONSTANZE	I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
M	SCHIKANEDER	Down payment? Who do you think I am? The Emperor? Whoops, I have to go.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Stay where you are. You're going to like this next one. We'll speak again. Triumph-de-luxe, my boy!
F	CONSTANZE	You're not going to do this?
F	MOZART	Why not? Half the house!
F	CONSTANZE	pays now, or you don't do it.
F	MOZART	Oh, Stanzi.
F	CONSTANZE	I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
F	MOZART	Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
F	CONSTANZE	Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
F	MOZART	Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
F	CONSTANZE	Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
F	MOZART	Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
M	SCHLUMBERG	Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
F	MOZART	Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
M	SCHLUMBERG	What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
F	MOZART	Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
M	SCHLUMBERG	What for?
F	MOZART	If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
M	SCHLUMBERG	Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
F	MOZART	No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
M	SCHLUMBERG	I'm sorry. No.
F	MOZART	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
M	SCHLUMBERG	My answer is no, Mozart.
F	MOZART	Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please.
M	VON SWIETEN	This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
M	SALIERI	I agree, Baron.
M	VON SWIETEN	Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
M	SALIERI	No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
M	VON SWIETEN	How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
M	SALIERI	Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
M	SALIERI	Herr Mozart?
M	SALIERI	I have come to commission work from you.
F	MOZART	What work?
M	SALIERI	A Mass for the dead.
F	MOZART	What dead? Who is dead?
M	SALIERI	A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
F	MOZART	Who are you?
M	SALIERI	I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
F	MOZART	How much?
M	SALIERI	Fifty ducats. Another fifty when I have the Mass. Do you accept?
F	MOZART	How long will you give me?
M	SALIERI	Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi? Wolfi!
F	CONSTANZE	Who was that?
F	MOZART	No one.
F	CONSTANZE	I heard voices.
F	CONSTANZE	What's the matter?
F	CONSTANZE	What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
F	MOZART	I'm not telling you.
F	CONSTANZE	Why not?
F	MOZART	You'd think I was mad.
M	OLD SALIERI	My plan was so simple, it terrified me. First I must get the Death Mass and then achieve the death.
M	VOGLER	What?
M	OLD SALIERI	His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
M	VOGLER	Yes.
M	OLD SALIERI	The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi. Wolfi!
F	MOZART	No. Don't answer it!
F	CONSTANZE	Why?
F	MOZART	Tell him I'm not here. Tell him I'm working on it. Come back later.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Am I interrupting something?
F	CONSTANZE	Not at all.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Where's our friend?
F	CONSTANZE	He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
M	SCHIKANEDER	I hope so. I need it immediately.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Is he happy with it?
M	SCHIKANEDER	Is this it?
M	SCHIKANEDER	What the devil is this? Requiem Mass? Does he think I'm in the funeral business?
F	MOZART	Leave that alone!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Wolfi!
F	MOZART	Put it down!
M	SCHIKANEDER	What is this?
F	MOZART	Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
F	MOZART	What?
M	SCHIKANEDER	What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
F	MOZART	Yes.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Can I see it?
F	MOZART	No.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Why not?
F	MOZART	Because there's nothing to see.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
F	MOZART	Well, we can.
M	SCHIKANEDER	So let me see it. Where is it?
F	MOZART	Here. It's all right here, in my noodle. The rest is just scribbling. Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling and scribbling. Would you like a drink?
M	SCHIKANEDER	Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
F	CONSTANZE	Leave him alone!
M	SCHIKANEDER	I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
F	CONSTANZE	He's doing his best.
M	SCHIKANEDER	I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
F	CONSTANZE	You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
F	CONSTANZE	Money! Money!
M	SCHIKANEDER	You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
F	CONSTANZE	Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you?
M	SCHIKANEDER	Listen, Wolfi. Write it. Please. Just write it down. On paper. It's no good to anyone in your head. And fuck the Death Mass.
M	SALIERI	Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
M	LORL	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
M	SALIERI	Why? What has happened?
M	LORL	You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
M	SALIERI	What medicine?
M	LORL	I don't know. He has pains.
M	SALIERI	Where?
M	LORL	Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
M	SALIERI	Is he working?
M	LORL	I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
M	SALIERI	Is he working?
M	LORL	I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
M	SALIERI	Opera? Opera!
M	LORL	Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
M	SALIERI	Are you sure it's an opera?
F	MOZART	I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
M	SALIERI	Are you neglecting my request?
F	MOZART	No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
F	MOZART	This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
F	CONSTANZE	Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
F	MOZART	Give me two more weeks. Please.
M	SALIERI	The sooner you finish, the better your reward. Work!
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi, I think you really are going mad. You work like a slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny and here. This is not a ghost! This is a real man who puts down real money. Why on earth don't you finish it?
F	CONSTANZE	Give me one reason I can understand.
F	MOZART	I can't write it!
F	CONSTANZE	Why not?
F	MOZART	It's killing me.
F	CONSTANZE	No, this is really awful. You're drunk, aren't you? Be honest - tell me - you've been drinking. And I'm so stupid I stay here and listen to you!
F	CONSTANZE	It's not fair! I worry about you all the time. I try to help you all I can and you just drink and talk nonsense and - and frighten me! It's not fair!
F	MOZART	Go back to bed.
F	CONSTANZE	Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
F	MOZART	Stanzi? Stanzi-marini-bini?
M	FRAU WEBER	She's not coming back, you know. She's gone for good. I did it and I'm proud of it. 'Leave,' I said. 'Right away! Take he child and go, just go. Here's the money! Go to the Spa and get your health back - that's if you can.' I was shocked. Shocked to my foundation. Is that my girl? Can that be my Stanzi? The happy little moppet I brought up, that poor trembling thing? Oh, you monster! No one exists but you, do they? You and your music! Do you know how often she's sat in that very chair, weeping her eyes out of her head because of you? I warned her. 'Choose a man, not a baby,' I said. But would she listen? Who listens? 'He's just a silly boy,' she says. Silly, my arse. Selfish - that's all you are. Selfish! Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish.
M	QUEEN OF THE NIGHT	A hellish wrath within my heart is seething! Death and destruction Flame around my throne! If not by thee Sarastro's light be extinguished. Then be thou mine own daughter never more! Rejected be forever! So sundered be forever All the bonds of kin and blood! Hear! Hear! Hear God of Vengeance! Hear thy Mother's vow!

M	VOICE	Go back!
M	PAPAGENO	Merciful Gods! If only I knew by which door I came in. Which was it? Was it this one? Come on, tell me!
M	VOICE	Go back!
M	PAPAGENO	Now, I can't go forward and I can't go back. Oh, this is awful!
M	FIRST PRIEST	Man, thou hast deserved to wander forever in the darkest chasms of the earth. The gentle Gods have remitted thy punishment, but yet thou shalt never feel the Divine Content of the consecrated ones.
M	PAPAGENO	Oh well, I'm not alone in that. Just give me a decent glass of wine - that's divine content enough for me. instrument himself.
M	FIRST PRIEST	Man, hast thou no other desire on earth, but just to eat and drink?
M	PAPAGENO	Well!
M	PAPAGENO	Well, actually I do have a rather weird feeling in my heart. Perhaps it's just indigestion. But you know, I really would like - I really do want - something even nicer than food and drink. Now what on earth could that be?
M	ANDANTE	A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
M	ALLEGRO	Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
M	ANDANTE	A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
M	ALLEGRO	I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
M	ANDANTE	A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
M	ALLEGRO	At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
M	SALIERI	I'll take care of him.
M	SALIERI	I have a carriage. Excuse me.
M	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Here I am, my angel.
M	PAPAGENO	What? Who the devil are you?
M	UGLY OLD WOMAN	I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
M	PAPAGENO	Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
M	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
M	PAPAGENO	I can't wait.
M	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Well, promise then.
M	PAPAGENO	What do you mean - now?
M	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
M	PAPAGENO	Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
M	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
F	MOZART	What happened? Is it over?
M	SALIERI	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
F	MOZART	No, no. I have to get back. I have -
M	SALIERI	Thank you. Go.
F	MOZART	Papa! Papa!
M	SALIERI	Come now.
M	SALIERI	Where is your wife?
F	MOZART	Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
M	SALIERI	You mean she's not coming back?
F	MOZART	You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
M	SALIERI	No, please.
F	MOZART	I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
M	SALIERI	I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
F	MOZART	This is only a vaudeville.
M	SALIERI	Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
F	MOZART	Do you mean that?
M	SALIERI	I do.
F	MOZART	I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
M	SALIERI	Are you ill?
F	MOZART	The doctor thinks I am. But -
M	SALIERI	What?
F	MOZART	I'm too young to be so sick.
M	SALIERI	Shall I answer it?
F	MOZART	No! No, it's him!
M	SALIERI	Who?
F	MOZART	The man. He's here.
M	SALIERI	What man?
F	MOZART	Tell him to go away. Tell him I'm still working on it. Don't let him in!
F	MOZART	Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
M	SALIERI	Finish what?
F	MOZART	He knows. He knows!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Herr Salieri.
M	SALIERI	Yes, I am looking after him.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Can we come in?
M	SALIERI	Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
M	SCHIKANEDER	But he's all right?
M	SALIERI	Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
M	SCHIKANEDER	Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
M	SALIERI	Of course.
M	SCHIKANEDER	And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
M	SALIERI	Bene.
M	SCHIKANEDER	I'll call tomorrow.
M	SALIERI	Yes. And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
M	ACTRESSES	Thank you! Thank you, Excellency!
M	SCHIKANEDER	Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
M	SALIERI	Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
M	ACTRESSES	Goodnight, Your Excellency. Goodnight!
F	MOZART	What happened?
M	SALIERI	He said to give you this. And if you finish the work by tomorrow night, he will pay you another hundred ducats.
F	MOZART	Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
M	SALIERI	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
F	MOZART	Would you? Actually, you could.
M	SALIERI	My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
F	MOZART	But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
M	SALIERI	Of course.
F	MOZART	You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
M	SALIERI	Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
F	MOZART	A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
M	OFFICER	What is it?
F	CONSTANZE	I want to go!
M	OFFICER	Where?
F	CONSTANZE	I want to go back to Vienna.
M	OFFICER	Now?
F	CONSTANZE	Yes!
M	OFFICER	Why?
F	CONSTANZE	I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
M	OFFICER	What are you talking about?
F	MOZART	Where did I stop?
M	SALIERI	The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
F	MOZART	So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
M	SALIERI	Consigned to flames of woe.
F	MOZART	Do you believe in it?
M	SALIERI	What?
F	MOZART	A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
M	SALIERI	Oh, yes.
F	MOZART	Strange!
M	SALIERI	Come. Let's begin.
M	SALIERI	Confutatis Maledictis.
F	MOZART	We ended in F Major?
M	SALIERI	Yes.
F	MOZART	So now - A minor. Suddenly.
F	MOZART	The Fire.
M	SALIERI	What time?
F	MOZART	Common time.
F	MOZART	Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, second beat. Ma-le-dic-tis. G-sharp, of course.
M	SALIERI	Yes.
F	MOZART	Third measure, second beat starting on E. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. Do you have that?
M	SALIERI	I think so.
F	MOZART	Sing it back.
F	MOZART	Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
M	SALIERI	Yes.
F	MOZART	Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
F	MOZART	Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
M	SALIERI	Please! Just one moment.
F	MOZART	It couldn't be simpler.
M	SALIERI	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
F	MOZART	With the tenors.
M	SALIERI	Also identical?
F	MOZART	Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
M	SALIERI	And that's all?
F	MOZART	Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
F	MOZART	Second measure on B.
F	MOZART	Do you have me?
M	SALIERI	I think so.
F	MOZART	Show me.
F	MOZART	Good, good - yes! Put it down. And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord. Do you see?
M	SALIERI	That's wonderful!
F	MOZART	Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
F	MOZART	C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
M	SALIERI	Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
F	MOZART	Yes, and on 'dictis'.
M	SALIERI	Yes!
F	MOZART	And underneath, just violins - arpeggio.
F	MOZART	The descending scale in eighth notes, and then back suddenly to the fire again.
F	MOZART	And that's it. Do you have it?
M	SALIERI	You go fast!
F	MOZART	Do you have it?
M	SALIERI	Yes.
F	MOZART	Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
F	MOZART	Do you want to rest a bit?
M	SALIERI	Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
F	MOZART	We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
M	SALIERI	I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
F	MOZART	Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
M	SALIERI	I'm not leaving you.
F	MOZART	I am so ashamed.
M	SALIERI	What for?
F	MOZART	I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
F	CONSTANZE	What are you doing here?
M	SALIERI	Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
F	CONSTANZE	Why you?
M	SALIERI	I was at hand.
F	CONSTANZE	Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
M	SALIERI	He needs me, ma'am.
F	CONSTANZE	No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
M	SALIERI	He asked me to stay.
F	CONSTANZE	And I'm asking you -
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi, I'm back. I'm still very angry with you, but I missed you so much.
F	CONSTANZE	I'll never leave you again. If you'll just try a little harder to be nice to me. And I'll try to do better, too. We must. We must! This was just silly and stupid.
F	CONSTANZE	What is this?
F	CONSTANZE	Oh no, not this. Not this, Wolfi! You're not to work on this ever again! I've decided.
F	CONSTANZE	This is not his handwriting.
M	SALIERI	No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
F	CONSTANZE	He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
F	CONSTANZE	Please.
F	CONSTANZE	Thank you.
M	SALIERI	But - but - but -
F	CONSTANZE	Good night.
F	CONSTANZE	I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
M	SALIERI	Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
F	CONSTANZE	Wolfi? Wolfi?
M	VOGLER	Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
M	OLD SALIERI	I did.
M	VOGLER	No, you didn't!
M	OLD SALIERI	I poisoned his life.
M	VOGLER	But not his body.
M	OLD SALIERI	What difference does that make?
M	VOGLER	My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
M	OLD SALIERI	No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
M	VOGLER	Oh my son, my poor son!
M	OLD SALIERI	Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
M	LOCAL PRIEST	The Lord giveth. The Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
M	OLD SALIERI	Why did He do it? Why didn't He kill me? I had no value. What was the use, keeping me alive for thirty-two years of torture? Thirty-two years of honours and awards.
M	OLD SALIERI	Being bowed to and saluted, called 'distinguished - distinguished Salieri' - by men incapable of distinguishing! Thirty-two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room, watching myself become extinct. My music growing fainter, all the time fainter, until no one plays it at all. And his growing louder, filling the world with wonder. And everyone who loves my sacred art crying, Mozart! Bless you, Mozart.
M	ATTENDANT	Good morning, Professor! Time for the water closet. And then we've got your favourite breakfast for you - sugar-rolls. He loves those. Fresh sugar-rolls.
M	OLD SALIERI	Goodbye, Father. I'll speak for you. I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint. On their behalf I deny Him, your God of no mercy. Your God who tortures men with longings they can never fulfill. He may forgive me: I shall never forgive Him.
M	OLD SALIERI	Mediocrities everywhere, now and to come: I absolve you all! Amen! Amen! Amen!
