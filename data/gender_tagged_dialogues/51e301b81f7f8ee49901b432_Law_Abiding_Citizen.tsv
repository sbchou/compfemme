M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	911 OPERATOR	911 operator, what is your emergency?
M	OPERATOR (V.O.)	Hello? Can you hear me? Can you speak?
F	CLYDE	...eyes... What? Can you speak up?
F	CLYDE	...her...eyes... Sir, what is the nature of your emergency? Sir? Are you injured? Do you need medical attention?
F	CLYDE	...her eyes...she can't...
F	CLYDE	She can't...close her eyes.
M	COP #1	Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s, need full response, 11-41.
M	CLYDE (V.O.)	Her eyes. That's how they were. Open like that. You see?
F	CLYDE	When I found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open. The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life. Can you understand that?
M	NICK (O.S.)	Yes. Yes, I can.
F	CLYDE	Can you? Really? You? Mr. Clyde. I don't see this helping.
F	CLYDE	No? You married? Children?
M	CANTRELL	Divorced. I have a son and daughter. Both in college.
F	CLYDE	My daughter was ten. I married late in life.
F	CLYDE	You, Mr. Price? Married? Kids?
F	NICK	I've seen the crime scene photos, Mr. Clyde. Many times. They're horrifying. But they don't alter the facts of the case.
F	CLYDE	Facts? Those men are guilty. Both of them. You know they are.
F	NICK	This isn't about what we know. It's about what we can prove in court.
M	CANTRELL	Things have gone against us. Tainted crime scene, evidence thrown out...
F	CLYDE	Maybe you just haven't tried hard * enough.
F	NICK	Look. We've had only one real break in this case. The fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole.
F	CLYDE	In return for immunity. So he gets away with it.
M	CANTRELL	The other man doesn't. He'll go down for the crime. That has to count for something.
F	CLYDE	Yes. It counts for half. Don't reward one of the men who murdered my family. Please.
F	NICK	Mr. Clyde. I can't claim to know what it's like to be in your position. Losing your wife and child. But please try to grasp how limited our options are. This is how the justice system works.
F	CLYDE	Ah. I see my mistake. I came for justice. Instead I got a system.
F	CLYDE	Sorry. My fault.
F	SARAH	It's okay.
F	SARAH	You're due upstairs in three minutes! You're gonna be late!
F	NICK	Thank you, voice of doom.
F	NICK	We doing the right thing?
M	REYNOLDS *	You even doubt it? C'mon, you didn't just tumble off the fucking truck. Do the math...
F	NICK	It's your office.
M	CANTRELL	It's your decision.
F	NICK	What do you think?
M	REYNOLDS *	What are you asking her for? She's * just an intern. *
F	SARAH	I am just an intern. *
F	NICK	You were top of your class at Yale, don't give me that shit.
M	CANTRELL	Young lady. Someday you might have our jobs. You know the issues of * the case before the court. Speak.
F	SARAH	Okay. Um. You can take both men to trial, spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars, and probably lose. Or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on death row. It's a no-brainer. * You make the deal. *
M	REYNOLDS *	Duh. *
M	CANTRELL	When the day comes that you argue a real case in court, you might refrain from summing up with "duh."
M	SARAH *	I'll avoid that. *
M	JUDGE BURCH *	The agreement has been vetted by both sides? Satisfactory to all?
M	REYNOLDS	Yes, your Honor. Defense approves.
M	CANTRELL	State also approves, your Honor.
F	NICK	Clarence Darby. This document guarantees that you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which you were both accused. In return, you will be
M	NICK (CONT'D)	shielded from further prosecution for those capital crimes. But you will plead guilty to the lesser charge of breaking and entering.
M	REYNOLDS	You'll do a maximum of five years. With good behavior, you could be out in three.
M	JUDGE BURCH	That also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation.
M	DARBY	Your Honor need not worry on my account. I assure the court that I am aware of the opportunity I've been given. And I am deeply grateful to all concerned.
M	DARBY	If I may. It has come to my attention that Rupert Ames has been spreading * lies about me to the tabloid press. * About certain alleged activities of * which I have no knowledge. Sexual and otherwise. Libel and slander...yes?
F	NICK	You can always sue him.
M	DARBY	Well, no matter. My tongue will wag in court, under oath. His tongue will wag in hell.
M	DARBY	He'll get the chair?
F	NICK	We don't do chair. We do needle.
F	NICK	Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow. *
M	CANTRELL	I'm not blind. Yet. I'll do it.
F	NICK	You're shitty on stairs. At least let me take the leash so the dog doesn't pull you down.
M	CANTRELL	No. She needs to imprint on me. Not you, not somebody else.
M	CANTRELL	That's the whole point of this phase. She needs to get the idea that she and I are partners. Then the real training can begin. Unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life.
F	NICK	I'll pass.
M	DARBY	...it was a burglary gone wrong. We thought the house was empty. Rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy. I was stoned and in fear of my own life, so I fled...
M	CANTRELL	Bill! You let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps?
M	REYNOLDS	Hellooo, kettle to pot. Since when do you shy away from publicity?
F	NICK	Since everything in this case has gone sideways so far. Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom.
M	REYNOLDS	He's your boy too now. You tell him.
F	NICK	Asshole.
M	REYNOLDS	Dickwad.
M	CANTRELL	Fuckface.
M	DARBY	...and may I say for the record how very sorry I am that I failed to prevent Rupert Ames from committing those terrible crimes...
F	NICK	You good here?
M	CANTRELL	Long as nobody bumps into me.
M	DARBY	...been given a chance to put the drugs and foul living behind me. To atone for my past failings and weakness of character. It is a gift given me by God's grace...
M	DARBY	...and the grace and wisdom of this court. I cannot thank you enough, sir. I cannot.
F	NICK	Marshal, escort your man, please! Mr. Darby is done here!
M	KELL	Shit day?
F	NICK	Shit day. Better now. How's she doing?
M	KELL	Fine. She drove me a little crazy today.
F	NICK	She was busy?
M	KELL	In overdrive. Here. Feel.
M	KELL	Of course she stops kicking the moment you get home.
F	NICK	I had to say some things to a man today I didn't want to say. And I did something I didn't want to do.
M	KELL	You didn't lie to him. Or bullshit him. Or shine him on.
F	NICK	None of those things.
M	KELL	So you had your reasons. You did what you had to. It's not your fault the world sucks.
F	NICK	You in there. Listen up. Your mother just said the world sucks. You may wanna rethink this whole thing. My advice? If you're asking? Just stay in there. I promise you, nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now...
M	KELL	What is wrong with you?
F	NICK	...plus there's shit you don't need to know about. Rap. Internet porn. Madonna's entire back catalog.
M	KELL	Did someone drop you on your head? Seriously. I have swollen ankles and all I do is pee. That baby's coming out.
F	NICK	Okay. I'm sure you heard that. Then again there are the Beatles. 70's funk. Louie. Ella. Be a shame to miss those. All right, kid. Bring it on. But when you're old enough for the world to disappoint you, I hope you won't blame your old man for bringing you into this mess. Give me that at least.
M	EMMA	Dad?
F	NICK	Huh? Wha--?
M	EMMA	You know what it is?
F	NICK	What?
M	EMMA	IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!
M	EMMA	IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!
M	EMMA	I'M SO COOL IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAY!
M	KELL	Glad it's once a year.
M	EMMA	Why can't you be here?
F	NICK	It's a work thing. Grownup stuff. You know that happens sometimes.
M	EMMA	But it's... ...MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!
F	NICK	I believe we've established that. I let go, you'll stop reminding me? We'll celebrate this weekend. Tonight is all about your friends. Knock * yourselves out, don't give mom any * grief. I'll try to be home in time to tuck you in, okay?
M	EMMA	Okay. But what are you doing tonight that is more important than...
M	EMMA	...my birthdaaaaay.
M	KELL	Something he'd get out of if he could. Here. Take lunch. Grab * backpack. We go. *
F	NICK	Nice evasion. Thanks.
F	NICK	How long she have to wear this stupid thing?
M	CANTRELL	Till the stitches heal. Week or two.
F	NICK	Poor honey. Sucks, doesn't it? But you're very pretty. Yes, you are. Even with a radar dish on your head.
F	SARAH	There they are. Like clockwork.
M	WARDEN IGER	Rupert Ames. Do you have anything to say?
M	RUPERT	I'm here. Clarence Darby ain't. And that ain't right. 'Cause that man is evil, ain't no other way to say it. All them things he done, and him turn witness against me for it.
M	RUPERT	I did wrong too. I guess I'll pay up. But it was always him sayin' jump and how high, and I just went along. Now he's killin' me and he got you people to do it. And that's a shame. A goddamn shame. And... ...and I guess that's all.
M	RUPERT	Ah...ah...AH!
M	RUPERT	Ah--ah--Jesus, don't that HURT!
M	RUPERT	OH FUCK, OH FUCK, THAT HUUUURTS!
F	SARAH	Oh, Jesus.
M	CANTRELL	What's going on? Nick?
M	CANTRELL	Nick, goddamn it, what?
F	NICK	I don't know!
F	NICK	WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON? DO SOMETHING!
M	IGER	We're still trying to sort through this thing.
M	CANTRELL	Gentlemen, we face a terrible shitstorm of scrutiny in the days to come. We need answers. Start with what we know.
M	IGER	Lethal injection is a series of drugs given in a specific order. Somebody had to have replaced one or more of those ingredients with something else. Industrial solvent? Acid?
M	DUNNIGAN	Let's not guess, let forensics do its job.
M	CANTRELL *	How could the chemicals be switched? We're in a goddamn prison! *
M	NICK *	I'll ask because somebody has to. * Is there any chance, no matter how remote, that this was an accident? A mix-up? Weird shit happens?
F	SARAH	Show them. The bad part.
M	DUNNIGAN *	Some kind of bypass on the phone * lines.
M	DUNNIGAN *	Twenty minutes before the execution, * the prison stopped receiving incoming calls and emails. Cell service went * dark too. Signal was probably jammed.
M	SARAH *	The bad part. I was just on with the Governor's office. He commuted Rupert Ames' sentence. They were trying to call us to stop the execution. They couldn't get through.
M	DUNNIGAN	The Governor's incoming number triggered this device and shut out any further calls.
M	CANTRELL	Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.
M	DUNNIGAN *	One more thing. *
M	DUNNIGAN	This mean anything to you? *
F	NICK	Clarence Darby. That's what he said when he agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight.
M	DUNNIGAN	"His tongue will wag in hell." Those very words? It was ten years ago.
F	SARAH	I remember it too. Some things stick in your head.
F	NICK	Check the court transcripts, they're public record.
M	GARZA *	I know this prick. I'm pretty sure * he's one of our C.I.s.
M	DUNNIGAN	You think, or you know?
M	GARZA	That's not the name he uses now. * But I'm pretty sure he's one of Bernstein's informants.
M	DUNNIGAN	Okay, raise Bernstein, I want everything he's got, including an address. We roll with tactical.
F	NICK	How about I ride-along? Give you a fast, accurate ID on this guy?
M	CANTRELL	Is that necessary?
F	NICK	You said yourself we should move fast. This thing'll be all over the morning news cycle. We'd all look a lot better if we have the right man in custody by then.
M	GARZA	That's him. "Wayne Dunlap."
M	DUNNIGAN	Is that Clarence Darby?
F	NICK	I think so. Hard to tell.
M	DUNNIGAN	Jesus, look at this. No wonder Bernstein loves him.
M	GARZA	We scored a lot of good intel off this fuckhead through the years. Almost a shame to bag the guy.
F	NICK	A shame?
M	GARZA	He's helped us put a lot of bad people behind bars. Look. Arrests, convictions...
F	NICK	I can read a C.I. profile. What I see is an asshole dirty up to his ears in the drug trade. So you cops look the other way? He gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you convictions?
M	DUNNIGAN	Isn't that what you did ten years ago? Give this guy a free pass in return for a conviction? Maybe we played this asshole to our advantage on the street, but you're the one who put him there. So, no offense, but you might wanna go fuck yourself a little.
M	DARBY	Wait...wait...
M	DARBY	Almost. Almost.
M	LISA	This shit makes you soft, baby.
M	DARBY	Thank you...for stating the obvious...you...bitch...
M	NEWSCASTER (V.O.) *	...rumors the execution did not go well due to technical flaws, but that has yet to be confirmed...
M	DARBY	"Did not go well." Way to go, Rupert. You even fucked up dying.
M	LISA	You know that guy?
M	DARBY	Knew. Past tense.
M	VOICE	Wayne?
M	DARBY	Depends. Who's this?
M	VOICE	Somebody who doesn't want to see you in jail. Look out your window. Argue later. Do it now.
M	VOICE	There's a world of shit coming your way. I'd get out the back. Now.
M	LISA	What?
M	LISA	Are those fucking cops?
M	LISA	You ain't leaving me here!
M	DARBY	OFF'A ME!
M	COP VOICE	You! Freeze right there!
M	DUNNIGAN	STAY DOWN!
M	VOICE	Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints.
M	DARBY	Kiss my ass.
M	VOICE	I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring extra ammo?
M	VOICE	You shot at cops. That's attempted murder if they find the gun on you. You're in deep enough without that.
M	VOICE	You'll need my help getting out.
M	DARBY	What'll it cost me?
M	VOICE	We'll discuss terms later. Go south, across 10th. Past the El tracks. Alley behind the clinic.
M	DARBY	What's there?
M	VOICE	A cop. Take his ride, he won't give * you any trouble.
M	DARBY	How do you know?
M	VOICE	'Cause I tasered his ass. You gonna keep asking questions?
M	DUNNIGAN	No way he's getting out of this neighborhood.
M	DARBY	Drive.
M	DARBY	Drive, fucker! I'll put your brains on the dash!
M	COP	Don't shoot! Don't hurt me, okay?
M	DARBY	Depends on you. Go.
M	COP VOICE	...air unit three...see no sign of suspect...think we lost him...
M	DUNNIGAN	Keep sweeping the area, unit three. Go house-to-house. Check everything. * Garages, dumpsters, storm drains... *
M	NICK *	You gotta be kidding me. *
M	NICK *	How could we lose him? *
M	DARBY	In the ditch.
M	COP	...please...don't kill me...
M	DARBY	Knees. Let's go.
M	COP	I'll never see my wife and little girl again. I'll never see them.
M	DARBY	It's fucked up.
M	DARBY	This my guardian angel? Hello?
M	COP	I see you got out okay.
M	COP	You know why I'll never see my wife and daughter again?
M	BENSON CLYDE	You took them from me.
F	CLYDE	Can't speak?
F	CLYDE	Tetrototoxin. Fascinating stuff. It paralyzes you, but leaves all other neurological functions intact.
F	CLYDE	That means you can't move. Or talk. But you can see. Hear. Feel. That last one's important. Feel. You can feel everything. Got some other items here. Drugs to revive you in case you pass out. Stuff like that.
F	CLYDE	Wearing off a little. No worries.
F	CLYDE	Oh. These. Don't want you bleeding out. This will take a while.
F	CLYDE	Teeth. Balls. Fingers. Maybe toes. Eyelids. In case you insist on shutting your eyes.
F	CLYDE	Earlier on the phone? I said I'd get you out? You asked me what it would cost? Well.
F	CLYDE	We'll start with an arm and a leg. Go from there.
F	CLYDE	I've been waiting to say that line * for years. But it wasn't very funny, was it? No. Played much better in my head. Maybe it's my delivery.
F	CLYDE	Gosh. My heart's beating. You? *
M	FEMALE VOICE	...unit twenty one, come in...unit twenty one, please respond...report your location...
M	EMMA	...and while we were singing karaoke, Ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face...
M	KELL	I saw it coming.
M	EMMA	...and suddenly she just went barf. Total puke moment. And we were all like, ewwww gross! It was so funny...
M	KELL	Funny for her. I cleaned it up.
F	NICK	I had my "ewwww gross" moment last night too.
M	KELL	Hey. I had a house full of shrieking ten year-old girls.
F	NICK	Hey. I saw a guy's veins dissolve.
M	KELL	Honey. It's not a competition. Okay, you win.
M	EMMA	...so Tara says that's what you get for eating too much cake and that almost made Ashley puke again...
M	KELL	Delivery.
M	EMMA	I'll get it!
F	NICK	Oh, shit. We've gone national.
M	EMMA	Thank you!
M	SERGEANT	...the suspect who tasered you last * night...was it the same person who * let you out of the trunk this morning?
M	HILTS	I never saw a face...either time...he wore a thing, a face shield...
M	VOICE	Sergeant! Sergeant!
M	YOUNG COP	Come quick! You gotta see this!
M	EMMA	Daddy?
M	KELL	Oh my God!
M	KELL	What the hell is this? Jesus Christ, Nick! Turn it off! Turn it off! It's okay, baby, I'm here...
M	SERGEANT	Oh my Lord.
F	NICK	My daughter is traumatized! She's * only ten! It's a goddamn snuff film! * In my home! *
M	GARZA	Price got a video of it happening delivered to his house...
M	DUNNIGAN	Yeah, we know. Nick, we know. The body's been found. The pieces, anyway. Call just came in. In some old shed on a farm outside * the city. About a hundred and fifty acre piece of property.
F	NICK	Belonging to who?
M	SWAT TROOPS	DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER-- DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS--
M	SWAT CAPTAIN	ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW!
M	DUNNIGAN	Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain silent...
M	DUNNIGAN	...understand your rights as I have explained them?
F	CLYDE	Yes.
M	GARZA (O.S.)	Check this shit out.
M	DUNNIGAN	CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF, PLEASE?
F	SARAH	He says he'll only talk to you.
F	CLYDE	Counselor.
F	NICK	Mr. Clyde.
F	CLYDE	Why so formal? We go way back. Call me Benson. Or Ben.
F	NICK	Well. I'm here. So?
F	CLYDE	So. Maybe you can explain what this is all about.
F	NICK	I think that's obvious.
M	DUNNIGAN	You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby.
F	CLYDE	Detective...?
M	DUNNIGAN	Dunnigan.
F	CLYDE	Dunnigan. I thought I'd made it clear I would only speak to the gentleman across the table from me.
F	NICK	You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby.
F	CLYDE	Darby? I knew about Ames, of course. I've been following the news about his horribly botched execution. But Darby too? Quite a coincidence.
M	DUNNIGAN	Cut the shit. We know you did it. Save everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess.
F	CLYDE	Are you going to continue to insist on being part of this conversation?
M	DUNNIGAN	Yes.
F	CLYDE	Fine. Far be it from me to be rude.
F	NICK	Clarence Darby was found on your property. Old abandoned shed? *
F	CLYDE	I didn't know I had one. It's 150 acres, uncultivated. The other day I found a creek I never knew I had. Hunters trespass all the time. You going to try to pin the dead deer on me too?
F	SARAH	I don't believe this guy.
M	CANTRELL	That man is frosty. It occurs to me that an even moderately clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply by killing him on my property. One of Darby's drug rivals? That's an unsavory world. A jury would have to weigh that possibility. What else you got?
F	NICK	How about video of you dismembering Darby while he was still alive?
F	CLYDE	That's odd. See, if I were to do such a thing, I'd probably wear something so I couldn't be identified. Some kind of mask maybe. But you say it's actually me on the video? Did the camera capture my good side? *
F	NICK	You sick fuck, you sent it to my house! My daughter saw that video! It fucking traumatized her! She couldn't stop sobbing!
M	DUNNIGAN	Whoa-whoa, Nick, ease off!
F	CLYDE	No trouble here, Detective, we're fine. Thank you, though.
F	CLYDE	Your daughter is, what, ten now? That's a wonderful age. My daughter was always so busy at that age, so interested, so into everything. Jumping around. I called her "Bean," she jumped around so much.
F	CLYDE	I am sorry, Nick, that your daughter experienced that. You're right. That video should not have arrived that way. The person who sent it should have thought twice.
M	DUNNIGAN	Okay, enough.
F	CLYDE	Unless there's hard evidence tying me to these crimes -- forensic or otherwise -- why am I here? Why are we having this conversation?
F	NICK	We know you did it.
F	CLYDE	It's not about what you know. It's about what you can prove in court. Your words. Like when you called it a justice system. You know the thing about a system, Nick? Any system can be played.
F	NICK	You think you can play us? You gonna take me on?
F	CLYDE	Clarence Darby did. And I'm much smarter than he was. Or you.
F	NICK	I'm gonna bury you, fucker!
F	CLYDE	That's it, that's what I want! That fire in the belly! That's what I wanted ten years ago! Do it, Nick! Bury me!
M	DUNNIGAN	Sit down! Sit the fuck down!
F	CLYDE	Or. Set me free.
F	NICK	What?
F	CLYDE	Did I stutter? Make your case. Or. Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way. I'll even make it easy on you. I will confess, how's that?
F	NICK	You're gonna confess.
F	CLYDE	Let's start tomorrow after a good night's sleep. We'll all be fresh and rested.
M	SARAH *	Ten years he's been planning this? * Patient people make me nervous. This? This freaks me out. *
M	DUNNIGAN *	Is he serious about confessing? * What's his deal, is he crazy?
F	NICK	Confession or not, we're gonna nail him on two counts of first-degree.
M	CANTRELL	Agreed, but softly. Nothing hard- ass, no grand-standing. Kid gloves.
F	NICK	Kid gloves? He's a psycho with a power saw.
M	CANTRELL	Depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child. Public sympathy is to be respected and feared. This could blow up in our faces if we're not careful. We can't look like we're pissed off or have an ax to grind. Are we pissed off? Do we have an ax to grind?
F	NICK	No.
M	CANTRELL	Then stop acting like it.
F	NICK	Okay. He got under my skin a little. That's done.
F	NICK	...background check's gotta be thorough, I want to know everything there is to know about this son of a bitch. Get all the ADAs on it, tell 'em I better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals...
F	SARAH	How about outside help? That P.I. who helped us on the Jacovitz case?
F	NICK	Yeah, he was good. And Hanson's * always reliable. But try to limit their hours, okay?
M	KELL	Well, hello there beauty!
F	SARAH	Hey Kell! Hey Emma, how's my dynamo?
M	EMMA	Hi, Sarah!
M	KELL	We haven't seen you in so long it's ridiculous. When are you gonna come by for a visit? Who needs a life, right? Talk to your husband, maybe he'll give us a day off one of these years.
M	KELL	Soon, huh? Seriously, we miss you.
F	NICK	Fuck.
F	NICK	I saw her bed empty. Scared the shit out of me. Don't know why.
M	KELL	She had a bad dream. She wanted to sleep with us tonight.
F	NICK	Jesus.
M	EMMA	Daddy...?
M	EMMA	I had a nightmare. That man. *
F	NICK	I know. Shhh. We're all good. You're safe. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
M	KELL	Especially not that man. Daddy's gonna put him in jail forever. That's what daddy does. He makes sure the bad people stay locked away.
F	CLYDE	I admit I expected something more modern. That jail downtown? *
F	NICK	Filled to capacity. It has been for years. They had to re-open this for the overflow. Part of it anyway. *
M	GARZA	Welcome to the county jail annex. * All new inmates come here. It was * in the papers.
F	CLYDE	Right. Prison crowding. It's a problem.
F	NICK	For the record: You've waived legal counsel. You've offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames. Yes?
F	CLYDE	We'll get to that. First, what I'd really like to talk about is the cot in my cell. It's lumpy. Hardly any padding? Steel springs? Very uncomfortable?
F	NICK	I know what lumpy means. Sorry to hear it. But we're not here to talk about prison conditions, we're here to talk about things you've done.
F	CLYDE	Start with things I haven't done. Like get any sleep last night. I said let's begin today fresh and * rested. You recall my words? * What do you want from me?
F	CLYDE	A bed in my cell.
F	NICK	A bed. In your cell.
F	CLYDE	Yes, please. One of those Sleep- Matic adjustables. Those are best. *
F	NICK	You want the variable temperature control too?
F	CLYDE	That would be nice.
F	NICK	Anybody?
M	DUNNIGAN	It's a steel cot! It's bolted to * the wall! *
F	CLYDE	I'm sure they have a wrench. *
M	IGER	We also have rules prohibiting * personal items such as beds. *
F	CLYDE	Let me get this straight. You're going to let a bed prevent this confession from taking place.
F	NICK	You looking to deal? All right, how's this? How about I don't kick your fucking teeth down your throat?
M	CANTRELL	Nick.
F	NICK	Sorry, Jonas. Okay, kid gloves. My daughter slept in our bed last night. She hasn't done that since she was six. You gave her nightmares. So excuse me if I don't feel like cutting any little deals today.
F	CLYDE	My daughter can't have nightmares, because she died with Clarence * Darby's breath in her face. You * gave him a reduced sentence and his * freedom. All I want is a good night's sleep.
F	NICK	This is bullshit. He's jerking our chain big-time...
M	CANTRELL	I can justify the expense. *
M	IGER	It's not just a bed. Every inmate * here will be on the phone to their * lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment. Can you justify that? *
M	SARAH *	We give him a bed, he confesses, we * take the bed away. At most it's one * night. *
M	CANTRELL	We're talking a high-profile double homicide. Order the bed.
M	CLYDE (V.O.)	Switching the drugs was easy...
F	CLYDE	I hacked the Fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. It's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. Nobody's questioning who receives what, or why.
F	NICK	And the prison phones?
F	CLYDE	Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit. They'll wave you through the gate, like they did me. It's simple if you know how things work. It's a system. You learn how it works. You play it. Any system.
F	NICK	I saw him die. That stuff burned his veins. He suffered terribly.
F	CLYDE	Score.
F	NICK	Let's move on to Clarence Darby.
F	CLYDE	Hey, you like music?
F	NICK	Very much. Why? *
F	CLYDE	I could tell. I love music. All of * it. It's like air in my lungs. So the thing about Clarence Darby is, I want my record collection and player brought to me. The vinyl discs as well as CDs.
M	IGER	Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards. They make excellent weapons. My answer to that one, Mr. Clyde, is not no, but hell no. *
F	NICK	It's a legitimate concern.
F	CLYDE	How about my ipod and speaker dock?
M	IGER	The player stays out here. You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out. Those terms aren't negotiable.
F	CLYDE	I appreciate your compromise.
M	IGER	You looking to get your ass kicked? By every inmate on this cellblock. You keep this up, they'll take it out on you. Harshly.
M	IGER	Just trying to keep you alive in here. That's all.
M	CLYDE (O.S.)	I took his fingers with a bolt cutter. His toes with a pair of tin snips. His balls with a hacksaw...
F	CLYDE	...his penis with a box cutter. His skin with a filet knife. His teeth with pliers. His eyes...for those I used my fingers. Check the video I made. All that will match up. I kept him alive for an hour, give or take. Time it.
F	CLYDE	What now?
F	NICK	My office types it up, you sign.
F	CLYDE	How about a signing bonus? The small concessions you've made so far have kept my cooperation flowing...why not give me a reward for signing?
F	NICK	You don't want to sign, don't sign. We've got you on videotape, we'll go to trial. In ten years, when your appeals are exhausted, I'll attend your execution. I'll make sure nobody tampers with the drugs.
F	CLYDE	Don't be such a hard-ass, Nick. I don't want much. Just a good meal. The food here? Sucks. No offense.
M	DUNNIGAN	What do you have in mind? There's a place in town on Halston. La Traviata. Ever been? *
M	DUNNIGAN	It's a little above my pay grade.
F	CLYDE	You know it, don't you, Nick? *
F	NICK	I've eaten there. So? *
F	CLYDE	They cater. Tonight, at 7 p.m., I * would like my meal delivered to my cell from La Traviata. With nice silverware, crisp linens...
F	NICK	Not gonna happen.
F	CLYDE	Why not?
F	NICK	Because I have no interest in making it happen. And you have nothing left to bargain with.
F	CLYDE	C'mon, Nick. We've just started bargaining. You haven't even heard what I'm offering yet.
F	CLYDE	Miss Lowell? Is your laptop still on? Would you please do a search?
F	CLYDE	William...Baxter...Reynolds.
M	DUNNIGAN	Who's William Reynolds?
M	CANTRELL	Clarence Darby's defense attorney. He brokered the testimony deal with us ten years ago. He's been missing now since... March of '06.
F	CLYDE	Detectives Dunnigan and Garza will like this offer, Nick. It'll clear one of their department's missing- persons files. And it'll solve them their third homicide this week.
F	NICK	Tell me.
F	CLYDE	How do you think I located Clarence Darby after he got out of jail and legally changed his name? Reynolds told me -- though it took some * convincing. *
F	CLYDE	You want the location of the body? Tonight, 7 p.m., I get my meal * delivered to my cell from La Traviata.
M	DUNNIGAN	SPECIAL AGENT SAM DAVIES, NICK PRICE WITH THE D.A.'S OFFICE!
M	DAVIES	NICK! TELL ME ABOUT THIS BODY!
F	NICK	SUSPECT SAYS NEW JERSEY! ACROSS THE STATE LINE! THAT MAKES IT FEDERAL, THAT MAKES IT YOU!
M	DAVIES	GET THE CAMDEN OFFICE TO HAVE A GROUND TEAM MEET US! LOCATION?
M	DUNNIGAN	SUSPECT WILL GIVE US A GPS MARK! WE'LL ADVISE YOU IN THE AIR!
F	NICK	I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE! PLEASE CALL ME! WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HOLDING THEIR BREATH ON THIS!
M	DAVIES	WILL DO!
F	CLYDE	GPS position is as follows...
M	VOICE ON RADIO *	...delta niner foxtrot...GPS * coordinates follow... *
F	NICK	What do we have so far? *
M	SARAH (V.O.) *	He's got no next-of-kin. No family * since his wife and daughter were * killed...
M	SARAH (V.O.)	He's a tinkerer. Little inventions * and gizmos...
F	SARAH	...he holds two dozen patents that have made him a lot of money the last ten years. He's invested a lot of it in real estate. Weird stuff.
M	CANTRELL	Weird how?
F	SARAH	Properties with no real value. Around * airports, chemical plants. Stuff * nobody wants...
M	CONVICT *	Motherfucker...
M	SARAH (V.O.)	He votes. He gives money to charity, mostly victim's funds...
F	SARAH	...but he also gives a big chunk to macular research.
M	CANTRELL	He donates to eye research?
F	SARAH	RPI. That's the charity you work with, isn't it?
M	CANTRELL	Huh. Strange.
M	WAITER	...consommé...sea bass...squab... * New York strip, rare...a variety of * pates...
F	CLYDE	Rack of lamb?
M	WAITER	...oh, yes, rack of lamb...
M	FIELD AGENT	WE THINK WE'VE GOT A CAIRN HERE! SOMEBODY LAID A BED OF STONES AND PLANTED SOD OVER IT!
M	WAITER	You're bruising the crepes.
M	GUARD	Life's a bitch, then you die.
M	IGER	...no plates, they break into nice jagged pieces...nothing sharp, nothing that can be made sharp...no forks, no knives, no spoons....lose that carafe...we will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening, thank you...you can eat with your fingers...
F	CLYDE	The guards will think me gauche.
F	NICK	Thanks. Keep digging.
M	IGER	Idiot.
F	CLYDE	I suppose if I don't share, you'll beat the shit out of me. Make me squeal like a piggy. That sort of thing.
M	DWIGHT	Fuckin' A.
F	CLYDE	I wonder what the little people are eating tonight?
M	FORENSIC TECH	Okay, let's see if we can get him out in one piece...
M	FORENSIC TECH	...gently on three...one...two...
M	DAVIES	--we'll have to wait for the autopsy results, but--
F	NICK	Agent Davies?
F	NICK	Why do you have him in the dome?
M	IGER	He killed his cellmate. We had to separate him out.
M	CANTRELL	What's wrong with solitary?
M	IGER	We don't have the authority. Not without a court order. This place was re-opened under protest as it is. Some areas are off-limits to our use -- tied up in a legal challenge by the ACLU as cruel and unusual. Especially solitary. It was nicknamed the dungeon...
F	NICK	Get Judge Burch on the phone.
M	IGER	Nice trick with the rack of lamb. Didn't see that one coming.
F	NICK	Why'd you kill your cellmate?
F	CLYDE	I claim self-defense.
F	NICK	Here's what I think. You suckered us in. You ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him.
M	CANTRELL	Which makes it premeditated. Again.
F	CLYDE	And, again, you'll have to prove that in court. As I've said before... ...make your case. Or set me free.
M	DAVIES	Your booby-trap killed two of mine * and put four in the hospital. That * brings the total of people you've * killed to six -- and be advised the * Bureau does not suffer losing agents in the field. We're done dancing. I have the right to claim jurisdiction here, do I not, Detective Dunnigan?
M	DUNNIGAN	That is correct, Agent Davies.
M	DAVIES	So. I'm gonna rendition your ass. Rumor has it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland. Don't bother packing, you're gonna disappear.
F	CLYDE	You see, Nick? That man is pissed! That's what I'm talking about! No deals, no compromise! You see?
F	NICK	I see you totally disconnected from reality, that's what I see!
F	SARAH	Judge Burch with an answer for you.
M	JUDGE BURCH	I'm the ACLU's biggest fundraiser in this state. You wanna put that piece of shit in solitary? Good. As far as I'm concerned, you can bury him in the bowels of hell.
F	NICK	Thank you, Judge Burch. Consider your court order signed. Freedom? Not likely. In fact, you just bought a one room suite in the dungeon. Very exclusive.
M	IGER	You'll have it all to yourself -- the first man down there in over twenty years. Quite an achievement.
F	NICK	You're doing everything wrong. Making all the wrong moves.
F	CLYDE	It would seem that way.
F	NICK	Sam. I know you got hit hard. I know you're furious. But I'd like my shot at prosecuting this case. This started with us. Let me finish * it. Give me that chance. *
F	CLYDE	I'm seeing fire in your belly, Nick. I like it. Keep going. This is our deal, after all...
M	CANTRELL	Let's not mistake this! This is not about the two of you!
F	CLYDE	Wake up, blind man! It's been exactly that since I watched him shake Clarence Darby's hand on the steps of the Hall of Justice ten years ago! The Hall of Justice!
M	DAVIES	You wanna take this fuck down? Be my guest. Whatever you need.
F	CLYDE	That's the spirit, yes! It's on you now, Nick. It's your game to lose. Just don't screw up. You do, they'll scapegoat you. That's * how the justice system works. * Good call, Sam. Making me disappear was a bad idea. You couldn't have handled the blowback.
F	NICK	Blowback? *
M	CLYDE *	Cause and effect. Your actions * provoke reactions. The choices you * make come back to haunt you. * There are things I've set in motion. * Dominoes that will fall. Didn't see * the rack of lamb coming? Start a list. All I can do at this point...if I feel like it...is stop them from happening. Ready to talk deal?
F	NICK	You're insane.
F	CLYDE	See how insane you think this is. You're going to release me from this place with all charges dropped within twenty four hours...
F	NICK	Or what?
F	CLYDE	Or I start killing everybody.
F	CLYDE	Clock's running, Nick.
M	CANTRELL	What can he do? We've got him boxed in. He's isolated, for God's sake.
F	NICK	Let's keep him that way. Strict rules apply. Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day, that's what he gets. Just one, under heavy guard. The other twenty-three hours, he's in that cell, he's a ghost, he doesn't exist. No contact whatsoever.
M	DUNNIGAN	You think it was a bluff? *
F	NICK	We underestimated him before. I'd like to know what this prick is capable of. Update on the background check?
F	SARAH	Properties, investments, a few small * businesses he owns -- a lot of it's * hidden behind false names and shell * companies, but we're still digging... *
F	NICK	That's it? Nothing else unusual? *
M	ROYCE	The last twenty years, he's been * Joe Blow Citizen. But prior to that, * we've hit a blank spot. He used to * do consulting for the government, * but we can't pin down what. *
F	NICK	What kind of government work leaves a blank spot, Sam?
M	DAVIES	I'll make a few discreet calls. See what I can find out.
M	KELL	Where are you?
F	NICK	Million miles away. Sorry.
M	KELL	Don't be. This guy's really doing a number on your head, isn't he?
F	NICK	Yeah. I guess he is. It's...killing his cellmate. I need that to make sense.
M	KELL	Why? Happens in prison all the time.
F	NICK	Yeah, I know, but...we're not talking some gang-banger. This man is precise. Does things for a reason.
M	KELL	He's psycho. You said so yourself. We saw it on that video. Psychos don't need a reason, Nick. They're just psycho. Whatever. You'll figure it out. You * always do.
F	NICK	Thanks. I'm a poor excuse, though. It's date night. You deserve better. Just wish you'd picked another * restaurant. *
M	KELL	This is our place. You love it here. * You should have said something... *
M	WAITER	Have we decided?
F	NICK	Sam? What is it? Not far, maybe six blocks. I'm having dinner with my wife.
M	DAVIES	Two words: doggy bag. Be in your office in ten minutes. * Nick, don't ask questions. I was on the phone all day. Believe me when I say we've got one shot at this.
F	NICK	He's coming here?
M	DAVIES	So I'm told. It's called inter-agency cooperation, but don't ask me what agency because I wouldn't know. This isn't even back-channels, this is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth. I just blew thirty years' worth of favors today calling in this one chit. I hope it's worth it. *
F	NICK	Yes. Yes, we're all here. Downstairs? Okay. Understood. He said not to take the elevator.
M	SPOOK (O.S.)	That's good there.
M	SPOOK	Which one of you is Davies?
M	SPOOK	You must be well thought of, Agent Davies. I don't do this. But I was asked nicely by the right people. They briefed me on your problems with Benson Clyde.
F	NICK	What are we dealing with?
M	SPOOK	Things I can neither confirm nor deny. Things of which, if I'm asked, I will disavow any knowledge.
M	CANTRELL	You gotta be kidding me with this guy.
M	SPOOK	He's not. Tell me you grasp the implication of what I've said, or we're done here.
M	CANTRELL	Yeah. Okay. I get it.
F	NICK	What was Clyde? Some kind of spy?
M	SPOOK	Spooks like me are a dime a dozen. Clyde was a brain. He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field. Ways to kill people. You need to get rid of somebody. It's not a situation where you can get close. What do you do?
F	NICK	Ask Clyde?
M	SPOOK	That's right. Ask Clyde. And he'd figure something out. Gizmos, strategy. He was good at it.
F	NICK	How good?
M	SPOOK	You play chess?
F	NICK	Yeah. Tournament level in college, matter of fact.
M	SPOOK	In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about ten steps ahead, so I'd take you in a game.
F	NICK	What about Clyde?
M	SPOOK	Off the charts. If you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty. Or fifty. He's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet. This cellmate he killed? You think that was random? Bullshit. That was a pawn taken off the board. If I were you, I'd be trying to figure out what the move was.
F	NICK	I have been. Any thoughts?
M	SPOOK	Top of my head? Was the cellmate ever connected with this case? Or with Clyde? Was anybody else in that facility? Guards? Cons? The janitor? Any connection at all, no matter how remote. Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does.
M	DAVIES	Like what? He's locked up. What can he do?
M	SPOOK	You're an average chess player, aren't you?
M	DAVIES	Actually, I kind of suck.
M	SPOOK	I can tell. But I like your tie.
M	DAVIES	Thank you. Father's Day.
M	SPOOK	There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but * trust me it works. You put your tie * on and all day long it slowly tightens. You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point. Clyde invented that.
M	EMMA	Daddy!
M	EMMA	Mom said I could stay up late. Wanna play Scrabble?
F	NICK	Let me talk to mom first.
F	NICK	Sorry about date night.
M	KELL	It's fine. You learn anything?
F	NICK	Thing or two.
M	KELL	Nick?
F	NICK	Hey, I was thinking. Maybe you could pack an overnight bag for you and Emma in case you need to...you know...spend the night in a hotel. Or something.
M	KELL	Why would we wanna do that?
F	NICK	No reason. It's like a fire-drill thing. You know. In case.
M	KELL	Honey?
M	KELL	What the hell are you doing?
M	EMMA	Daddy?
F	NICK	It's okay, baby -- I'm fine, I promise. Go back to your game.
M	KELL	Seriously, Nick. What the fuck.
F	NICK	Nothing. I got paranoid for no reason, that's all. I'm fine now. I can't believe I let that son of a bitch Clyde get to me like that.
M	KELL	Are you in danger? Are we?
F	NICK	I'm sure we're fine. *
M	NICK *	I'll make goddamn sure. * (beat, into phone) * Sarah, roust the ADAs. Tell 'em * we're pulling an all-nighter.
F	NICK	Ready to turn this place upside down?
F	NICK	See if there's anybody locked up here -- or working here -- ex-cop, witness for the prosecution -- anybody who might have had anything to do with the original Darby-Ames case, or has any previous history with Benson Clyde. Start with the cellmate. Flag anything, no matter how insignificant it seems...
M	JAMESON	This could take days.
F	SARAH	We boring you, Jameson? You got someplace to be?
M	JAMESON	No, Miss Lowell.
F	SARAH	Weekend plans? Cancel 'em! I don't wanna hear any shit about it! Clack-clack, Jameson. Clack-clack.
F	NICK	Well?
M	DUNNIGAN	It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable bed. Now it's not.
F	NICK	What do you have?
M	TEAM LEADER	Rocky Mountain Way. Joe Walsh. What do you want from me, it's a fucking ipod.
M	NICK *	Tear it apart, make sure. Memory. * Speakers. Wiring. Everything. *
M	FBI FORENSIC	Blood stain. Few fibers. That's it.
M	CONVICT	Warden, man, whassup?
M	IGER	Everybody back to sleep.
F	NICK	I want to see him.
F	CLYDE	You're up early. Trouble sleeping?
F	NICK	It was a good bluff. But you're done. Fucking with my head. Scaring * my family half to death. Done.
F	CLYDE	Amazing, isn't it? How primal that is. That pull? What a man is capable of when it comes to his family? *
M	NICK *	You strip away all the polite shit, * that's what we're really about. I hope you never face what it is to * lose them, Nick. It's like dying yourself. There's nothing worse.
F	NICK	Good night, Ben.
F	CLYDE	Good night, Nick.
F	CLYDE	Is it casual Friday? I've never seen you not wear a tie.
F	SARAH	We dug pretty deep for one night. Still got a ways to go, but on a first look? Nothing. Nada. Zip.
M	IGER	Well, that's good news.
F	NICK	So far. Now we double-down. Make * absolutely certain. * (nods after ADAs) * Let them all sleep a few hours, * then bring 'em back for round two. *
F	SARAH	Due diligence. My middle name. *
M	DAVIES	Fellas. For once, glad not to be of assistance.
M	DUNNIGAN	Love it when they cry wolf.
M	DUNNIGAN	Miss Lowell! Lost something!
F	NICK	You're gonna be all right.
F	NICK	MEDIC! I NEED A MEDIC!
F	NICK	Baby. Listen. Don't be worried or scared. But I want you to pack those overnight bags... I don't have time to explain now. Just do it, okay? I'll call you back as soon as I can -- please, honey, I gotta go.
M	DAVIES	Each car had an explosive charge on the gas tank.
F	NICK	He's got someone working with him. On the outside. He's got to.
M	DAVIES	Not necessarily. Everything looks pre-rigged.
M	BOMB EXPERT	We found a short-range transmitter beacon buried outside the prison wall. When your people showed up here and drove in through the gate, the signal armed the bombs. *
M	DUNNIGAN	He could have planted those bombs a month ago.
M	CANTRELL	No...no, we've got two dozen ADAs on payroll. Those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment. How could he know which eight would show up?
M	DAVIES	He didn't. Our people just found bombs on every car in your ADA pool. All two dozen. We're disarming those now.
F	CLYDE	I want a phone in my cell. If I'm conducting my own defense, it would be useful. Also in case you and I need to be in touch, Nick.
F	NICK	Fuck you.
F	CLYDE	Your twenty four hours are about up. In return for the phone, I'll extend you another twelve hours.
F	NICK	If not?
F	CLYDE	How many more people die while you stand around dithering? How many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in?
M	CANTRELL	Motherfucker! Whatever point you had was lost long ago! Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college! Eight! I have to talk to their families. I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead.
F	CLYDE	I've been waiting for my explanation for ten years. So far... ...NOBODY'S FUCKING BOTHERED!
F	CLYDE	If it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war. As in any war, there will be collateral damage. The question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw.
M	DUNNIGAN	Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we end this war right now. Fourteen people dead! I have to say * this out loud? Prisoners die in custody all the time. Attacking a guard. Trying to escape. Shit like that.
M	DUNNIGAN	Don't tempt me.
M	GARZA	Jesus Christ, man, dial it back...
F	CLYDE	Do it. It would be decisive. Stupid, but decisive. Can you handle the blowback, Detective? The "shit like that?"
F	NICK	Put the gun away! Are you crazy?
M	DUNNIGAN	It's an option. All I'm saying. Risk the blowback. Ride it out.
F	NICK	We're not risking anything. Or letting him tear us down. You're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. No way.
F	CLYDE	I like rules. I've wanted you to follow them from the start. Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family. So. Rules. A phone buys you another twelve hours. But if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline...
F	NICK	What? What then?
F	CLYDE	I'll kill someone in this room.
F	NICK	Who?
F	CLYDE	Eenie...meenie...miney...moe...
F	CLYDE	...my mother...told me...to pick...a person...and that...person...is...
M	CANTRELL	Who's he pointing at?
M	CANTRELL	Fuck him. Let him try.
F	NICK	That's not helpful! We have fourteen * dead! You could ask them what he's capable of, but they're in no position to answer.
M	CANTRELL	Point taken.
M	DAVIES	We'll give him his phone. We'll tap in and monitor every call.
M	DUNNIGAN	Buys us another twelve hours, we could use that right now. That puts the deadline at... ...about 7:30 tonight.
M	CANTRELL	Shit. I'll be in front of a room full of lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner. I'm the keynote speaker.
F	NICK	No way. Find a replacement.
M	DUNNIGAN	Until his deadline passes, you're in protective custody. Not negotiable.
F	NICK	And have them switch the location of that dinner.
M	CANTRELL	That's last minute.
F	NICK	Exactly. He could have gotten your schedule in advance -- been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else. That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit. We have to get a few moves ahead. Plan for every contingency.
M	DUNNIGAN	This way, Mr. Cantrell. Garza, you're with Mr. Price.
F	NICK	Hey baby -- no, I'm fine. Really. Honey, calm down...
F	NICK	Our shit just hit the fan in a big way -- we're all over the news... Yes, all eight died. Sarah's in surgery right now... ...they think so, but... ...okay, I'll meet you there. Love you.
M	BOMB EXPERT *	You're good. Car's been swept.
F	NICK	Of course it has. Thanks.
M	GARZA	Go around. I'll get us in back.
M	GARZA	Keep the press off this floor, understand?
F	NICK	Any word?
M	KELL	She's in surgery now. They're saying she'll be okay.
F	NICK	Thank God. That's good.
M	KELL	Good? You'll have to explain the good part, Nick. I'm missing it. This is crazy. What if something happened to you? What would I say to Emma? What would we do?
F	NICK	You didn't lose me. You won't. Does the school know we're pulling Emma out of class?
M	KELL	I called, yeah, but -- I'd rather be here for Sarah when she wakes up. Nick -- and for you. I want to do something...
F	NICK	You are. Getting our daughter out of harm's way. And yourself. Detective. Will you escort my wife, please? There's not much time. I'll be there to see you off. Okay? Please?
M	REPORTER	...reporting live from a tense scene at City Hall...we have confirmation of earlier reports that eight people with the district attorney's office were killed this morning in an explosion at the County Correctional Annex in George Hill...
M	REPORTER	...details are sketchy at this point, and names are being withheld...
F	NICK	Sarah's fine. That's the good news.
M	ROYCE	Oh, God, that's a relief... Miss Lowell is okay...she's okay...
M	ROYCE	We've been getting calls from upstairs. The mayor's people. Someone from our office has to make a statement to the press. With Mr. Cantrell absent, the mayor wants you to do it.
F	NICK	Royce...how much petty cash do we have in the safe?
M	ROYCE	I don't know...four thousand?
F	NICK	Give it to me. And your cell phone. I need to borrow it for a few days.
M	ROYCE	What do you want me to tell the mayor?
M	ROYCE	We in the D.A.'s office are still reeling from the events of this morning, as you can imagine. It's a tragic day for us...for our city...
M	EMMA	I wanna see Sarah...
F	NICK	Hey, hey...she's fine, don't be scared. That's not allowed. And there's no reason for it.
M	EMMA	This sucks.
F	NICK	I know.
M	EMMA	Why do we have to go?
F	NICK	'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows. You gonna begrudge her that?
M	EMMA	You're kinda full of shit, Dad.
F	NICK	Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a little. But only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. Sarah, us. I mean it. Okay?
M	EMMA	Okay.
F	NICK	No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash.
F	NICK	I'll keep this. It can be traced. Use this one instead. Don't answer unless you see it's me. * FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR NEW YORK CITY DIRECT, FINAL CALL...
M	KELL	Anything else?
F	NICK	I love you.
M	KELL	Emma's right. This sucks.
M	KELL	Be goddamn careful.
F	NICK	Jesus. *
M	CANTRELL	Nick? These guys won't even let me pack a bag. Not even a toothbrush.
M	DAVIES	We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker...
M	DAVIES	I'm betting something lethal.
M	TECH #1	Like this salt. Not sodium chloride. Potassium chloride. It's a neuro-blocker, stops the heart -- they use it in lethal injections. You'd be dead before you got up from the table. *
F	NICK	I'm telling you, Clyde has someone * working with him. Someone on the outside.
M	CANTRELL	Who? Who could he have?
F	NICK	Somebody from his past. Could be * that spook we met on the stairs, * for all we know -- he'd know how to * plant this shit...
M	CANTRELL	Him? No--why would Clyde let him come talk to us?
F	NICK	To fuck with our heads? To get us to bring in our ADAs so he could blow them up?
M	DUNNIGAN *	It would be a Clyde move. But it's * not proof. Could he have planted this stuff in * your house before he was arrested?
M	CANTRELL	I--I don't know...
F	NICK	Jonas, think -- last few days, have * you used any ice? Any salt?
M	CANTRELL	I don't use salt--my cholesterol. Ice? Yeah--not long ago.
F	NICK	Before or after he was arrested?
M	CANTRELL	I don't remember! You track your * use of ice, Nick? You keep a daily * log?
M	TECH #2	Heads-up! Looks like polonium here. In his tea pot. Same way the Russians killed Litvenenko. Took him two weeks to die. It's an exotic isotope. All you need is a trace amount. Rips through your organs and bone marrow.
M	NICK *	I'll buy you a new toothbrush. *
F	NICK	Holy shit.
M	CANTRELL	Nice?
M	DAVIES	I'm actually a little jealous Clyde didn't pick me.
M	DUNNIGAN	It's the presidential suite. Last person who stayed here was actually a president. Of a country. Security here is amazing.
M	NICK *	It's not bad, Jonas. I think you can muddle through.
M	DAVIES	You're muddling with him. I don't want you back at your house until my people sweep it. You need pajamas, buy some in the shop downstairs.
F	NICK	The background check my office was compiling -- these properties we * think Clyde owns? If he is working * with somebody, they could be * operating out of any of these. We * should check them. *
M	DUNNIGAN	I'll try to wrangle additional * manpower. Big job. *
M	DAVIES	No shit. This is quite a list. Over * forty locations?
F	NICK	It's not even complete. Sarah was * in the middle of it -- untangling property ownership from under assumed names, shell companies. She's the expert on all that.
M	CANTRELL *	Fellas... I'm grateful for all your efforts. I just wanted to say it.
F	NICK	Save it for tonight. Hope you're in the mood for Chinese takeout.
M	CANTRELL	Where are you going?
F	NICK	That stuff in your house -- it's all gone too far. I started this. I owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it.
F	CLYDE	Interesting location you've chosen.
F	NICK	I thought we'd have some privacy.
F	CLYDE	For what? A talk? Or... Maybe you've decided to take Detective Dunnigan's advice.
F	NICK	Be the perfect place for it. Outside the wall. Look like you were shot trying to escape.
F	CLYDE	You have some kind of signal worked out? You scratch your nose and blam, I'm a goner?
F	NICK	Something like that.
F	CLYDE	Might solve all your problems. What's stopping you? Afraid of the blowback?
F	NICK	No. It's to prove a point. Just because I have the power, doesn't mean I have to use it.
F	CLYDE	Ah. Nice. Good one.
F	NICK	One can show mercy.
F	CLYDE	Mercy. Right.
F	NICK	Yeah. So why don't you?
F	CLYDE	I think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, Nick? I mean, what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which way to the execution chamber?
F	NICK	Don't give me that. Death doesn't scare you.
F	CLYDE	Yeah, but...we're in the flow of this now. You cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with * it. You don't just stop because * someone says hey wait. By then the dogs are dragging you.
F	NICK	Until one side admits defeat. What if I did that? What if I said... ...you were right. I was wrong. What if I say I should have prosecuted both men ten years ago?
F	CLYDE	I'd say you're making progress. You should have, you know. Prosecuted both.
F	NICK	I'd have lost.
F	CLYDE	With your head held high. And without any blame from me.
F	NICK	Yeah... She is? Great news. I'll stop on my way back. And Royce? Put some get- well flowers in her room, they sell 'em in the lobby. Thanks. Six hours in surgery.
F	CLYDE	But she's okay -- good. Miss Lowell is a fine young woman. Oh, hey...your wife and little girl get out of town all right?
F	NICK	You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose.
F	CLYDE	Just a guess. It's what I would do. Get 'em out, make sure they're safe. C'mon. Like I'd ever have hurt them anyway.
F	NICK	No?
F	CLYDE	There are limits. Even in war. I may be many things, Nick. But I'm not Clarence Darby. I'm not Rupert Ames. I'm not that kind of monster.
F	NICK	What kind are you?
F	CLYDE	Not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child. Christ, look at me. Mine were my salvation -- then they were killed -- and all I had left was this. Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world.
F	CLYDE	It hurt to lose them, didn't it? Your family. Even knowing they'd come back.
F	NICK	Yeah.
F	CLYDE	Imagine knowing they wouldn't.
F	NICK	I can't. I can't imagine that. *
F	CLYDE	Good. I envy you. For me, knowing * mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years. If I could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, I would.
F	NICK	I won't make any more deals with murderers. If hearing that makes a difference...if that was the point of all this...you've won.
F	CLYDE	Counselor. I have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that. I wish I could. Are we done? You gonna scratch your nose, or can I go?
M	SECRETARY	Judge's chambers.
M	VOICE ON PHONE	Laura? Laura, that you?
M	SECRETARY	I'm sorry, Judge Burch is gone for the evening.
M	VOICE ON PHONE	Dang it. Listen, honey, I flew in from Galveston for this A.B.A thing Laura invited me to -- just got here and they said it was moved. You got a number, address, anything?
F	SARAH	...tell Hansen we need hard info on those addresses...don't let the shell game on ownership title slow him down...at this point we'll take educated guesses...
F	NICK	Hey.
F	SARAH	Hey. Nice flowers. Thanks.
F	NICK	How you doing?
F	SARAH	This place has great drugs. Damn. I should've totaled my leg long ago.
F	SARAH	They're all dead?
F	NICK	I'm afraid so.
F	NICK	You're alive. That counts for a * lot. * I'm sorry I put you in harm's way. *
F	SARAH	It wasn't you. It was that son of a bitch. I hear he's threatened Jonas? *
F	NICK	We're all over it. Jonas is safe -- * out of reach. *
M	CANTRELL	Who's winning?
M	FLEMING	Laszlo, the cheatin' prick...
M	LASZLO	Yer mama...
M	GARZA	Wanna sit in?
M	CANTRELL	If I had my Braille set, I'd clean you out. Not much of a game if you have to tell me what my cards are.
M	GARZA	Right...sorry.
M	CANTRELL	People forget. No worries. Enjoy your game, fellas.
M	FLEMING	Need help? Want one of us should walk you down?
M	CANTRELL	I'm good. Unfamiliar places take me a little longer. But I get there.
M	GARZA	Holler if you need anything. Okay, who's in, who's out...
M	M.C.	Good evening. Sorry for any confusion our last-minute change of location might have caused...
M	M.C.	...please join me in a warm welcome for our keynote speaker this evening, Judge Laura Burch...
F	NICK	...yes, you pain in the ass, of course I got your kung-pao...you think I'd forget...just don't give Betsy any, I can't deal with dog farts all night...
M	CANTRELL	How long, man, I'm starving...
F	NICK	I'm minutes away. Relax.
M	CANTRELL	It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
M	JUDGE BURCH	...Jonas was upset not to be here with you tonight...a personal matter came up...but he wanted me to give you all his fondest regards...
M	CANTRELL	There. That's better.
M	FLEMING	...we need help up here... *
M	GARZA	Jesus Christ. What the fuck hit us?
M	MAYOR	We're worldwide news this morning. Almost twenty dead, among them some of this country's top attorneys. I had friends in that room. Hell, I almost attended myself.
F	NICK	The second explosion. I saw a rocket * fired. * Clyde does have somebody on the outside.
M	MAYOR *	What you saw or think you saw is * beside the point. What matters is * that the FBI wanted to rendition * this man out of my city. The reason * he's still here causing havoc is you. You wanted to prosecute this case. Your ambition kept him here * and provoked this tragedy.
M	DUNNIGAN	...not entirely fair...
M	MAYOR	Detective. Your job is hanging by a thread. I'd think a man of your experience would know when to keep his mouth shut and his ass covered.
M	MAYOR	When I go in front of the cameras today -- unlike some people who seem unwilling to do so when asked -- I'm going to make goddamn sure the media doesn't hang this abject disaster around my neck. Why? Because I'm hanging it on yours. You're done. Gone. Fired. Non- existent. Get the fuck out.
M	CLYDE (V.O.)	Hey. Some legal team from the mayor * showed up here this morning. I hear * you're off the case. Told you they'd * scapegoat you, didn't I? Nick? You there? *
M	NICK *	How'd you kill Jonas? I know about the second explosion, I saw the contrail, so I know you got somebody working for you. But the first explosion -- how?
F	CLYDE	Say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem. Hungry ex-wives. Greedy mistress. Heavy gambling debts. *
F	CLYDE	Say that guy's a veterinarian. You * hand him a million in cash, he'll * do what you ask. Especially if he's * looking to blow town for good...
F	NICK	It was...inside the dog?
F	CLYDE	You own the vet, you own the dog. Explosive wasn't even that big. Stuff I use, it didn't have to be. Hidden in plain sight. That's my specialty. Haven't you figured that out yet?
F	CLYDE	What's next for you? Mulling career options? I suppose law is out.
F	NICK	I'm trying to get over my friend being dead. Aside from that, fuck you.
F	CLYDE	Fair enough. I'll miss you Nick. It was a good dance.
F	NICK	Didn't bring your family back, though, did it? Has it made you feel better? All this? You done making your point?
F	CLYDE	Just warming up. This is Clausewitz shit, my friend. Total war.
F	CLYDE	I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on my head. Stay tuned. It'll be Biblical.
M	REPORTER	...going live now to City Hall where Mayor Tilden is about to make a statement...announcing, we're told, among other things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price...
M	MAYOR	Thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion...
F	SARAH	We got the latest batch of background in. Hansen and the other guy did some good work here--
F	NICK	Sarah. Give it a rest. It's over. We're done. I'm done. The mayor is nailing my coffin shut. The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can -- see what you can salvage of your career.
F	SARAH	This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own -- stuff around chemical plants, factories. All are owned by Benson Clyde. Look at twenty-two.
F	NICK	"Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage." Went out of business in '94. Now why would Joe's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone?
F	SARAH	The garage, not so much. But the address. Look at the location.
M	DUNNIGAN	Dunnigan.
F	NICK	Do we finish this tonight?
M	DUNNIGAN	Nick? Jesus... Look. No hard feelings, but there is no "we." You're radioactive. I * can't even be seen talking to you...
F	NICK	I know who he's got on the outside. I'll ask again. Do we finish this tonight?
M	DUNNIGAN (O.S.)	All units. Subject vehicle is on the move.
M	DUNNIGAN	Everybody maintain distance. Maintain two thousand foot ceiling... Subject vehicle turning south off of Hudson...into an alley...
M	DUNNIGAN	Hang back...hang back...
M	VOICE #2 (V.O.)	I got a white van...large cube type...think he switched vehicles... moving north again on Hudson...
M	DUNNIGAN	Five and six, stick with that building in case he's trying to cowboy us. All other units, stay with the van...
M	VOICE #3 (V.O.)	I have visual on van. Logo on side reads "Nomos Custodial Services."
F	NICK	Where the hell is he going?
F	NICK	You don't suppose Nomos Custodial * has a service contract with City Hall, do you?
M	SECURITY GUARD	Mr. Nomos! Ain't seen you around.
F	CLYDE	Ted...had to get that vacation in. Visited my sister in the Keys...
M	SECURITY GUARD	Nice. Good for you.
F	CLYDE	Hey, what's all that hoopla at the main entrance?
M	SECURITY GUARD	Mayor's got a big fuckin' thing. Thousand dollar a plate whatever. They say the Governor might come.
F	CLYDE	I'll stay out of their way.
M	SECURITY GUARD	They're up on six, avoid that floor. They got more security than God...
M	DUNNIGAN	What floor?
M	SECURITY GUARD	I told him to avoid six... There...
M	SECURITY GUARD	That's the main courtroom on five. *
F	NICK	That's right below the ballroom. The Mayor's event.
M	TAC LEADER	Subject in sight. Do we take him?
F	NICK	No. Let him go. We know where to find him. Let's get to that courtroom.
M	DUNNIGAN	I hope you know what the fuck you're doing. Negative. We're letting him go. All units hang back. Repeat. We are letting the subject go.
F	NICK	There.
M	DAVIES	Don't touch it! Could be motion sensitive!
M	DAVIES	I need light!
M	VOICE #4 (V.O.)	I have visual...suspect leaving the * building...different service exit...
M	DAVIES *	Crap. * Explosives. Nasty ones. *
M	DUNNIGAN	What? C-4? *
M	DAVIES	C-4 is for girl scouts. This is malglinite. Take out the whole floor above us...maybe this entire corner of the building...
F	NICK	Can you open it? Disarm it?
M	DAVIES	No, we got tripwires. We open this lid, instant karma's gonna get us. Don't see a motion sensor. Trigger looks simple...dial a cell phone, incoming call arms the trigger -- trigger's set to count down from forty seconds, then boom. That call comes in, we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible.
M	DUNNIGAN	Alert the mayor's security team. * Evacuate those people upstairs -- * clear that ballroom, go!
F	NICK	No!
M	DUNNIGAN	No? What the fuck are you talking about, this could go off any second!
F	NICK	He won't set it off until that room is full! People are still arriving, red carpet shit, that's at least another half hour!
M	DUNNIGAN	I will not take that risk!
F	NICK	You have to!
F	NICK	If I'm him, I've rigged cameras in that ballroom -- live video feed -- first sign of an evacuation, I trigger the bomb. We have to think ahead of this fuck!
M	DAVIES	I'm open.
M	DUNNIGAN	Okay, Nick. What's the move?
F	NICK	I came to talk. Guess who wasn't in his cell? Imagine my surprise.
F	CLYDE	Imagine mine.
F	NICK	Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself tossed into solitary -- * pre-rigged with exits from all five * cells. Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered. I thought I was such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you wanted.
F	CLYDE	That's how you play. Make the other guy think it's his idea. You came to talk, so talk.
F	NICK	Been thinking. If I'd done things differently -- made different decisions from the start -- we wouldn't have gotten to this point.
F	CLYDE	But it happened. And here we are.
F	NICK	Here we are. Your decisions put us here too. This mess is on both of us. *
F	CLYDE	You want to hold hands? What's your point?
F	NICK	We can't change decisions we've made. We can only account for decisions we make from here. I know what mine will be. What about you? You gonna finish dialing that number, or what?
F	CLYDE	If I don't? What are you offering?
F	NICK	You looking to deal?
F	CLYDE	I'm willing to listen.
F	NICK	Okay, here's the deal. The deal is...there is no deal. I told you. No more deals with murderers. I'm sticking to that. That's my decision. It's what you * taught me. Strange as it sounds, * I'm grateful for the lesson. *
F	NICK	Your turn. You make the right decision, I'll see what I can do for you. But the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life.
F	CLYDE	I'm sorry.
F	NICK	Me too...
F	NICK	...because like I said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life. Which at this point I figure is... ...another 35 seconds.
F	NICK	Check mate.
F	CLYDE	Well played.
M	IGER	Jesus. * Thank God that wing was empty. *
M	IGER	How do I explain this to the city?
M	DUNNIGAN	I think the Mayor will have your back.
M	FADE OUT
