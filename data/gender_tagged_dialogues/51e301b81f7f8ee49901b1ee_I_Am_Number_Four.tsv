M	DANIEL (V.O.)	This is the part I hate the most. The running. But it's the only thing in my life that's real. The rest is a lie. My name. My birthday. Even Henri. People think he's my father. He's not. His job is to keep me alive.
M	DANIEL (V.O.)	We are hiding from the Mogadorians. A brutal race that wiped out our entire planet, Lorien.
M	DANIEL (V.O.)	Only nine children escaped the genocide. We were each given a number and sent here to hide. I don't know where the others are. I only know when one of them is murdered.
M	DANIEL (V.O.)	I got the first scar when I was eight. I woke up screaming. We lived in Vermont. The second was on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was the third. His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.
M	DANIEL (V.O.)	Because of the spell our Elders cast, the Mogs can only kill us in order. That's the reason I've survived this long. But our enemy is relentless.
M	DANIEL (V.O.)	Now their hunt has turned to me. I am number 4.
M	HENRI	Florida's clear. I sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers.
M	DANIEL	I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table.
M	HENRI	New IDs. Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name.
M	DANIEL	Just when I think you can't get any less original, you lower the bar.
M	HENRI	I'm not interested in originality. I'm interested in untraceable. There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United States.
M	JOHN	It's been so long since the last scar.
M	HENRI	You got lulled into a false sense of security. That's my fault. John struggles to keep his temper in check.
M	JOHN	I liked Florida. I liked having friends. I liked feeling normal. Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.
M	HENRI	I wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't. Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
M	JOHN	Then why fake it? Why not just go hole up in the wilderness.
M	HENRI	That's exactly what Number 3 did. John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on
M	HENRI	It's from an African news site. A man and his son went missing two nights ago. The locals think they were taken by strange beasts. John understands the implication.
M	JOHN	Piken.
M	HENRI	The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters. Blending in is our best protection.
M	JOHN	So we just keep moving from town to town?
M	HENRI	Until I say otherwise -- yes. John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice
M	JOHN	I want to be from someplace, Henri.
M	HENRI	You are.
M	JOHN	Lorien's your home, I don't even remember it. John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.
M	HENRI	Like it or not, it's your home too. You have a responsibility to those who died.
M	JOHN	I want a say in where we live. You already picked it, didn't you? Henri REVS the ENGINE to life.
M	HENRI	Cheer up, you're going to be living in Paradise. A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign that's planted on the

M	HENRI	What's your name?
M	JOHN	John Smith.
M	HENRI	Where are you from, John?
M	JOHN	Arizona.
M	HENRI	Why did you move to Paradise?
M	JOHN	Because you're an asshole. John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one... Because my dad needs peace and quiet to research his book. Henri nods and smiles wryly.
M	HENRI	This was a lot easier when you were
M	ANNIE	Here we are. Home sweet home. They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
M	ANNIE	First impressions?
M	HENRI	It's perfect. Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins
M	JOHN	That's one word for it. Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie
M	ANNIE	I feel your pain. I have a daughter his age. Apparently, I ruin her life on a daily basis. John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL
M	JOHN	This guy was covering a hole in my wall. Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.
M	ANNIE	I told the handyman to patch that before you arrived. I'm so sorry. Henri is all charm, gently leads her to the front door.
M	HENRI	Don't you worry about it. She nods, grateful.
M	ANNIE	We'll knock it off the rent. Keep the poster, Bernie Kosar brings good luck here in the Buckeye State.
M	JOHN	That's the last of them. I'm hitting the sack.
M	HENRI	I need a new photo first. John crosses and stands against the wall.
M	HENRI	Say Paradise. John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot. Henri turns to another laptop.
M	HENRI	I've imputed the new search words: Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key. Sunset High School. You think of any others?
M	JOHN	Yeah, this place sucks. Henri swivels to face him.
M	HENRI	If there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it. Our enemy doesn't know who you are -- I want to keep it that way. John nods, knows he's being a jerk.
M	JOHN	Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we were jet skiing. Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door.
M	HENRI	I found our intruder -- he's a little small for a Mogadorian. At that moment,
M	A BEAGLE	slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies
M	JOHN	He's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags.
M	HENRI	Must have been dumped.
M	JOHN	You know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing. Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles
M	HENRI	What are you going to call him?
M	JOHN	Since I need all the luck I can get -- how about Bernie Kosar?
M	JOHN	Wow. You outdid yourself. What's up? Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.
M	JOHN	I already have a backpack.
M	HENRI	This one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld GPS. Keep it with you at all times.
M	JOHN	Henri, come on.
M	HENRI	Game's changed. You're in the crosshairs now. You have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. With or without me. John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white-
M	JOHN	Bernie, what the hell... were you hiding in the car? He scoops the dog into his arms.
M	FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)	Hey, I was about to take a picture of the little guy. John turns and finds She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is
M	JOHN	He's not supposed to be here. Go home. Now. Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home.
F	SARAH	He's really well-trained. How long have you had him? John turns away.
M	JOHN	Sorry about your shot.
F	SARAH	No worries. He begins walking towards the entrance.
F	SARAH	You just moved into the house on Old Mill Road. It's John, right? John swings back, concerned.
F	SARAH	Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age. Since I know every other face on this quad, that had to be you. I'm Sarah. He nods.
F	SARAH	Where are you from?
M	JOHN	Someplace warmer.
F	SARAH	I don't think that qualifies as an actual answer.
M	JOHN	I need to register. She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.
M	JOHN	Whoa. What are you doing?
F	SARAH	Capturing your first day, even though you're technically six weeks late.
M	JOHN	Please don't point that at me.
F	SARAH	Afraid the camera's going to steal your soul? She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed,
M	JOHN	What's your problem? I said no.
F	SARAH	It's only for the yearbook. John regains his composure.
M	JOHN	I'm not big into having my picture taken. Sorry. As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
M	A BACKPACK	viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the
M	VOICE (O.S.)	Welcome to Paradise, irony not included. John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a
F	SAM	His name's Mark Jayne. Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's three years into the best four years of his life. John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.
F	SAM	Do yourself a favor -- stay off his radar.
M	JOHN	Didn't know I was on it.
F	SAM	You were talking to Sarah Harte.
M	JOHN	She was talking to me.
F	SAM	Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since Freshmen year. John looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around
F	SAM	If there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down. You got a warning shot. John piles the books into his locker.
M	JOHN	Maybe I'll fire back next time.
F	SAM	Look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater. Football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals. If you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves.
M	JOHN	You sound like my dad.
F	SAM	Obviously a wise man. I'm Sam by the way. Sam extends his hand. John doesn't take it.
M	JOHN	Thanks for the download. As he SLAMS his locker shut...
M	COACH	Alright, people. Let's hit the gym. The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a
M	COACH	Okay, half court, three on three. Girls have this basket, boys have that one. Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the
M	COACH	New kid, you're up. Show me what you've got. John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his
M	THE SHOT	goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard
M	SHATTERS.	Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards
M	COACH	Enough! Hit the showers. LeBron, grab a broom. As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah is clutched in Henri's hands. He heads down the hall and Satisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes
M	BERNIE KOSAR.	The dog is studying him with his head cocked.
M	HENRI	Let's keep this our little secret. OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes...
F	SAM	First day here and you're already destroying school property. So much for not making waves. John moves past him and grabs a tray. He's flushed and his
M	JOHN	It was an accident.
F	SAM	I hear the real spectator sport was Mark and Sarah's blowout. John wipes his brow, distracted.
F	SAM	Dude, you okay?
M	JOHN	Fine. At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front
M	MARK	You got a problem?
M	JOHN	Line starts back there.
M	MARK	Football players get priority.
M	JOHN	Where's that posted?
M	MARK	Unwritten rule. I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't tell you. Sam puts his hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John.
M	MARK	If you don't know your place around here, things can get rough. John holds his ground.
M	JOHN	In that case, I guess I better ask you where I should sit. I was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend. In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into
M	MARK	You want to talk trash? Let's see you back it up. John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of
M	LIGHT	blooming from his palms! He quickly balls them into fists,
M	MARK	Get up! SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching his fists, John rises A shaft of white light blooms from within. The shadow of the
F	SAM	Dude, hold up! John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight.
F	SAM	You look like crap. I'll get the nurse. But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction. The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows
M	IT'S HENRI.	John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face.
M	JOHN	Henri, what's happening to me?
M	HENRI	Calm down. You're going to be okay. John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.
M	JOHN	On what planet is this okay?
M	HENRI	Yours. I need to get you out of here.
M	JOHN	Okay, start talking. What the hell's going on?
M	HENRI	Your first Legacy is starting to manifest.
M	JOHN	Legacy?
M	HENRI	An extraordinary ability. Yours is called Lumen. They start a lot sooner on Lorien. I was beginning to fear yours would never emerge.
M	JOHN	You knew this was going to happen? Why didn't you say anything?
M	HENRI	I didn't want to worry you. You were already under enough pressure. I'm sorry. John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious.
M	JOHN	What else have you been hiding from me?
M	HENRI	This couldn't be opened until your first Legacy appeared. Ready? John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his
M	THE DISCS	momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John
M	JOHN	Whoa. PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold.
M	HENRI	Open it. John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat
M	JOHN	What are they?
M	HENRI	Crystals from Lorien's core. They'll guide us in your training. John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.
M	HENRI	Place your hand over them. John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut-
M	HENRI	Our solar system. Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution
M	HENRI	That's what Lorien looked like thousands of years ago. We had all the problems that Earth has today. The planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly Lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the Legacies started. John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his
M	HENRI	Only a select few developed these abilities. They became known as the Garde.
M	JOHN	That's what I am?
M	HENRI	Like your parents and grandparents. John considers this new information.
M	JOHN	The other children in the ship... Henri finishes John's thought.
M	HENRI	They're Garde as well. Once you've mastered your Legacies, we'll find them and face the Mogadorians together. John looks at Henri, curious.
M	JOHN	What Legacy do you have?
M	HENRI	I don't have any and never will. I'm your Cepan -- a teacher. My job is not just to protect you but to train you. Give me your hand. Henri takes one of John's hands and pulls a cigarette lighter
M	HENRI	Trust me. Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's
M	HENRI	You feel that? Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin. But when
M	JOHN	Ouch. John jerks his hand away. Henri kills the flame, shrugs.
M	HENRI	When we're done, your entire body will be shielded against fire. John rubs his singed wrist.
M	HENRI	You'll get other Legacies too.
M	JOHN	Flying would be cool.
M	HENRI	You don't get to pick them off a menu. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the
M	HENRI	Mogs don't knock. Henri steps to his computer bank and examines a laptop
M	HENRI	It's a girl. John looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise.
F	SARAH	How'd you do it? Her accusation startles him.
M	JOHN	Do what?
F	SARAH	Eviscerate the entire senior class? She pulls a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat.
F	SARAH	I was in the darkroom before lunch and they were hanging on the line smiling and looking forward to the future. When I got back, I found 15 rolls of negatives wiped clean. John shrugs innocently.
M	JOHN	I don't know what you're talking about.
F	SARAH	So you weren't in the darkroom today?
M	JOHN	No.
F	SARAH	Here's a tip. If you're going to lie, don't leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime. She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He
M	JOHN	I don't know what happened. Maybe it's a sign that you should invest in a digital camera.
F	SARAH	Digital sucks. Film tells the truth. Clearly, I'm not going to get that from you. He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs
M	MARK JAYNE	is behind the wheel and watches as her headlights fade into
M	HENRI	Everything okay?
M	JOHN	She was returning my backpack. He dumps it by the door.
M	HENRI	I think you should stay home from school for a couple of days.
M	JOHN	I'm fine.
M	HENRI	Just to be safe.
M	JOHN	I'm going for a run. Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly.
M	JOHN	Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up. John moves at superhuman speed, leaving a blurring wake of John charges towards a secluded stream. It's 30 feet wide. alights in a nearby oak tree. John bends to tighten his He grits his teeth and takes off for home. As he passes the Unperturbed by the superhuman throw, Bernie hightails after
F	SARAH	disappearing into a room at the end. He's torn, then makes a
F	SARAH	I think you have the wrong room. She rises, walks past him and begins searching the photos
M	JOHN	Wanted to apologize.
F	SARAH	Does the apology come with an explanation? He turns to go, has his hand on the door when --
F	SARAH	Wait. He looks back. Her face softens.
F	SARAH	How about we delete Monday and start over? She steps forward and extends her hand.
F	SARAH	I'm Sarah.
M	JOHN	John. TIGHT ON THEIR HANDS as they shake. She checks out his
F	SARAH	Nice gloves. She crosses to the board, reaches down to lift it when John He effortlessly picks it up and hooks it onto the wall. They
M	JOHN	You know all these people? She nods.
F	SARAH	Curse of a small town. I've been around them my whole life. Kim Thomas. She peed in her bed at a sleepover when we were seven. Neil Bailey. President of the Debate Club. Plays five instruments. Doesn't know he's gay yet. Mrs. Ross. AP English. She's been here so long, she taught my mom and my four brothers. I'm the baby of the family in case you were wondering. Her curious eyes scour his face.
F	SARAH	So what's your story?
M	JOHN	Not very interesting.
F	SARAH	Determined to keep the mystery alive, aren't you? His finger arrows in on a photograph of Sarah. It's a candid
M	JOHN	You first.
F	SARAH	Okay. Recovering cheerleader. Wannabe vegetarian but I still love burgers. Dreams of being a photojournalist. I've never actually admitted that last one to anybody before.
M	JOHN	Your secret's safe with me. She studies him, sensing a kindred spirit.
F	SARAH	You ever feel you don't belong in your own life?
M	JOHN	Every single day.
F	SARAH	Wow. That almost sounded like a straight answer. They look at each other. There's a charged silence. The What's he doing in here? John and Sarah spin to find Mark. Sarah is flustered.
F	SARAH	I thought you were on two-a-days.
M	MARK	Coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come. You didn't answer my question?
F	SARAH	John was helping me move some boards. John turns to Sarah.
M	JOHN	I'm going to take off. Mark doesn't take his eyes off John and blocks his way.
M	MARK	Seriously, Sarah, what's up with this guy?
F	SARAH	I don't have time for this, Mark.
M	MARK	But you had time to go to his house the other night. Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission.
F	SARAH	You were following me?
M	MARK	Just trying to figure out what's going on with you. Sarah's shock turns to anger.
F	SARAH	You've crossed so many lines I can't even speak to you right now. She hustles out of the room. Mark glares at John.
M	MARK	This isn't over. OFF John, unmoved by the threat...
M	A TEEN GIRL.	kneels in front of John's old desk searching the drawers.
M	KABBBOOOOOOM!	The house detonates. The concussive force of the blast rips
F	SAM	Nice freakout the other day.
M	JOHN	Wasn't feeling well. They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his
M	A RED INK PACK EXPLODES.	It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking
M	JOHN	has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the
M	MARK	Told you it wasn't over. Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks. He frantically
F	SAM	Assholes. John looks back at Sam. Mark seizes his chance and launches John squeezes it vice-tight. Mark grimaces in agony. His
M	JOHN	That sensation you're feeling -- remember it. With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers.
M	JOHN	Show's over. The crowd disperses. Mark gets to his feet and exits with
F	SAM	I raided lost and found. He holds up a puke-green sweater decorated with red snowmen.
F	SAM	I know. Nobody loses anything cool. He sits and begins to change.
F	SAM	Dude, the way you thrashed Mark back there. Awesome move. John acknowledges that with a nod. Whip-dries his shirt.
M	JOHN	Who's in the picture? Sam stares at it, nostalgic.
F	SAM	My dad. My real dad. I took it the summer before he split.
M	SAM (CONT'D)	He dragged me and my mom all over the Yucatan. He was looking for evidence of ancient astronauts. All I got was Montezuma's Revenge. Sounds like a fun vacation.
F	SAM	I know. Insane. He called himself an anthropologist even though he only made it through one semester of college. He rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash.
F	SAM	Always thought he'd come back one day -- who was I kidding. The guy's a joke. As the BELL RINGS...
M	SARAH (O.S.)	John. He turns in surprise as Sarah approaches.
F	SARAH	I heard about the lockers. I'm sorry.
M	JOHN	I'll live. He starts off again.
F	SARAH	I broke up with Mark. He stops, slowly turns back.
F	SARAH	I've been thinking about doing it for a while... today just finally pushed me over the edge. He studies her face.
M	JOHN	Why are you telling me? She bows her head, suddenly embarrassed.
F	SARAH	I don't know.
M	JOHN	You made the right call. The certainty of his voice soothes her. She looks up and
F	SARAH	Halloween Block Party's tonight.
M	JOHN	I saw the banners.
F	SARAH	I'll be on Main Street hiding behind my camera if you want to swing by. He says nothing.
F	SARAH	I wasn't expecting an actual response. I could text you later. Do they have cell phones on Planet John? She holds out her phone. John looks at it tentatively, then
M	HENRI	Wasn't that your friend from the other night?
M	JOHN	Her name's Sarah. I didn't ask for a ride home.
M	HENRI	Principal called. Said there was an incident. John stares out the window, guilty.
M	JOHN	A guy was messing with me. I took care of it. Problem solved.
M	HENRI	You're stronger and faster because of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores.
M	JOHN	It was no big deal. Don't blow it out of proportion.
M	HENRI	You can't risk everything over wounded pride.
M	JOHN	I wasn't looking for a fight. It just happened. Get off my back. Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it.
M	HENRI	Article says it was arson.
M	JOHN	We were clean. There's no way the Mogs can track us here. Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off.
M	HENRI	They can track us anywhere. I think it's time you saw what you're really up against. is open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and

John's
M	GRANDFATHER	This is your Cepan. Go with him.
M	YOUNG JOHN	No!
M	HENRI	Your life is my life now. I will always protect you. He must survive. A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots
M	A MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him

M	JOHN	I saw my grandfather. I saw what you did to the Mogadorians -- you saved my life.
M	HENRI	A lot of Lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live. John is still trying to process the memory.
M	JOHN	He said I must survive.
M	HENRI	The Elders had a plan. You weren't on that ship by chance. The nine of you were chosen for a reason. Even if only two of you live, together you'll pose a grave threat to our enemy. Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.
M	JOHN	You saw what they did to Lorien. How can nine or six or two of us take on that army? It's hopeless. Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.
M	HENRI	I never thought we'd get off Lorien alive -- but we did. I didn't know how we could survive on a strange planet -- but we have. I gave us six months before the Mogs found us -- it's been 10 years. Don't give up now. Henri grips John's shoulders.
M	HENRI	You have the potential to do great things. Even if you don't see it -- I do.
M	JOHN	How can you put so much faith in me?
M	HENRI	Because your life is my life. If you quit, then everything I've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless. Remember -- nothing is inevitable. The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS.
M	JOHN	It's Sarah. The Block Party's tonight. I'll say I can't make it. Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion.
M	HENRI	No... go. John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.
M	HENRI	You've had enough for one day. John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the
M	JOHN	You work here?
F	SAM	Not by choice. Ed's my stepdad. He's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they'll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods. John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter.
F	SAM	I put those on special tonight for any wannabe Jason Voorhees. Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with
F	SAM	Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll hang with you. He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.
M	JOHN	What about your stepdad?
F	SAM	He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's already hammered by now. I'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep. Every night is trick âr treat at my house.
F	SAM	She's over there. John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
F	SARAH	You made it. Like the T-shirt, Sam.
F	SAM	Guidance Counsellor said I need to set goals for myself. Figured I'd aim high. She looks back at John.
F	SARAH	What do you think of Halloween in Paradise? John regards a particularly over-the-top float.
M	JOHN	They should pull out all the stops next year.
F	SARAH	Well, you haven't had the full experience until you've been on the Haunted Hayride. She motions to the picnic area where TEENS are lining up to
F	SARAH	Give me a sec. She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the
F	SAM	I'm impressed. Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.
F	SARAH	You guys ready?
F	SAM	Three on a wagon might get a little crowded. I'll meet you two on the other side. He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John
F	SARAH	Sam's cool.
M	JOHN	Definitely unique.
F	SARAH	I haven't really talked to him since 8th grade. Mark had a tight circle. If you weren't a jock or cheerleader, you didn't exist.
M	JOHN	I'm glad you broke free.
F	SARAH	Me too. OFF their growing connection... OMINOUS POV: WATCHES from the trees as a wagon with John and
M	FIVE GIANT RUBBER SPIDERS	drop from the trees. Sarah freaks as the arachnids dangle
F	SARAH	Not even a flinch. None of this scares you, does it?
M	JOHN	I'm trembling on the inside. He smiles.
F	SARAH	You can smile. I was starting to have my doubts. She takes his hand. They CLATTER past a series of grisly A TEEN jerks and SCREAMS in mock agony as he is fried in an A BLOOD-SPLATTERED DOCTOR CACKLES as he hacksaws the legs off A squad of blood-hungry VAMPIRIC FOOTBALL PLAYERS attacks a

F	SARAH	That was insane. A werewolf HOWLS somewhere in the darkness. Something
M	JOHN	What was that?
F	SARAH	Just part of the ride. He turns, sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle
M	JOHN	Are you sure? As he steps forward,

F	SARAH	Let go! Stop it! John tries to stand, but a boot CRACKS him in the ribs.

F	SAM	Sarah? She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to
M	TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS	trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the
M	JOCK (O.S.)	You're blinding me! Stop! Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.
M	JOHN	Where's Sarah? Tell me!!
M	JOCK	Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that damn flashlight! John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15
F	SARAH	Are you crazy! Where's John? Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away.
M	MARK	Relax. It's a practical joke.
F	SARAH	I swear if you hurt him --
M	MARK	Why do you give a shit?
F	SARAH	Get out of my face, Mark, you're pathetic.
M	MARK	I'm the best thing that ever happened to you and I'm giving you one more chance. Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave.
M	MARK	Don't walk away from me! Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance
M	JOHN (O.S.)	Back off! Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above
F	SARAH	John! Are you okay? He nods. Mark looks past him, confused.
M	MARK	Where the hell are Kevin and Joe? John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles.
M	JOHN	They got spooked.
M	MARK	Hey, those are police property! John flings them over Mark's head into the water.
M	MARK	I'm going to kill you! With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him,
F	SARAH	John! Stop! Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps
F	SARAH	That's his throwing arm! But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps
F	SARAH	Football's all he's got. John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah
F	SARAH	John! Wait. Sarah catches up.
F	SARAH	I'm sorry, I didn't want you to break his arm.
M	JOHN	I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself. She stops, faces him.
F	SARAH	I had no idea Mark would pull something like that. He has seriously gone off the deep end.
M	JOHN	The guy's in love with you. Wants you back.
F	SARAH	That's not love. Their eyes meet in the moonlight.
F	SARAH	Walk me home?
F	SARAH	This is me. John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the
F	SARAH	I know. Wait until the Christmas decorations go up. My mom decks the halls with so many lights, you can see our house from space. Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
F	SARAH	You should see a doctor.
M	JOHN	For this? Wouldn't waste their time. She looks at him, curious.
F	SARAH	You're not going to tell me how you took out those football players, are you? He says nothing. She smiles.
F	SARAH	I really don't get you. She steps closer.
F	SARAH	But I feel like I can trust you.
M	JOHN	You can. The air is charged.
F	SARAH	Good night. Sarah swings open the white picket gate.
M	JOHN	Wait. As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
M	THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS	rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but
M	THE PUMPKINS	instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles
M	JOHN	I better go. OFF Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour...
M	HENRI	I heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight. Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie
M	JOHN	They won't talk.
M	HENRI	That was a stupid thing to do. What were you thinking?
M	JOHN	They attacked me. If I hadn't defended myself, I'd be in the ER right now. Would that have been the better choice? You've got to start trusting me! Emotionally charged, John points his finger at Henri, Coffee and shards splatter across the floor. Henri looks at
M	JOHN	I was getting to that. I got a new Legacy. Henri absorbs that revelation.
M	HENRI	Telekinesis. That's a big step. Must have been triggered by the fight. John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze.
M	HENRI	I need to teach you how to control these abilities. We'll start working on that tomorrow. The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive
M	JOHN	What is it? Henri pulls up a website.
M	HENRI	We got a hit on one of the search words. It's a paranormal blog. âThey Walk Among Us!â ANGLE ON COMPUTER: A video buffers into motion. It's
M	JOHN	That's Sand Dollar Beach.
M	HENRI	Looks like a cell phone camera. There's enough for the Mogs to ID your face.
M	JOHN	Can you take it down? Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands.
M	HENRI	Working on it.
M	JOHN	I'm sorry, Henri.
M	HENRI	This isn't your fault. There's still nothing to trace us here. Henri glances up from his screen.
M	HENRI	This could take all night. Get some sleep. PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as he scans the message with alarm. JOHN hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm. A bad
M	JOHN	blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera
F	SAM	I've narrowed it down to three possibilities: you're a genetic experiment, you're a freak of nature, or you're an extraterrestrial.
M	JOHN	I don't know what you think happened tonight... Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face.
F	SAM	Your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you took off faster than an Olympic runner. Did I leave anything out? John silently reels.
M	JOHN	What do you want from me?
F	SAM	I just want to know who you are. John looks at Sam, realizes he's not going to give up. He
M	JOHN	I'm a survivor from a planet called Lorien. Sam absorbs this confession with awe.
F	SAM	Your dad... he's from there too?
M	JOHN	Henri's not my dad. He's my Guardian. If he found out you knew about us, we'd be gone by morning. I don't want to leave Paradise.
F	SAM	I won't tell anyone. John nods, grateful.
F	SAM	There's something I want to show you. The tarp is whipped off the pickup truck. It's an old Ford.
F	SAM	The cops found it abandoned in the middle of Route 20, just south of White Sands, New Mexico. It was my dad's. He went missing six years ago. He was on one of his crazy fact-finding trips. He believed we weren't alone in the universe. Sam rubs his hand across the hood, wondering.
F	SAM	Mom figured he was having an affair and took off. All these years I thought she was right. Now you're here.
M	JOHN	That doesn't prove anything.
F	SAM	It proves he wasn't crazy. I'm starting to think that he didn't bail on us... that maybe something else happened out there -- that he was taken. The moment is broken by the SLAM of the front door and the
F	SAM	Guess the bar closed.
M	ED (O.S.)	Sam! Where are you? His speech is slurred and aggressive. You think I wouldn't hear you locked up early! John looks at Sam, shocked and concerned.
M	JOHN	You going to be okay?
F	SAM	If he finds you here, it'll be worse. Go. Sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and heads
M	JOHN	You look wiped. Henri turns and smiles playfully.
M	HENRI	I wasn't the only who was up last night. John nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies...
M	JOHN	Sarah texted me. I went over to her house. Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers.
M	HENRI	I've tried every trick I know, but I can't crack that blog's firewall.
M	JOHN	There must be a way. We need to find where the site's located and take it offline manually. The URL source has been run through a labyrinth of servers, it could take weeks to track down.
M	JOHN	I want to help. Henri takes a gulp of coffee and stands.
M	HENRI	You can. Get changed.
M	STOP IN MIDAIR.	It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his
F	SARAH	I don't see any family pictures around. I guess the photo aversion is hereditary. He greets the observation with a shrug. She carries on.
F	SARAH	Your mom... grandparents. Is there anyone else in your life?
M	JOHN	They died.
F	SARAH	I'm sorry.
M	JOHN	It was a long time ago. It's just me and my dad now. John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle's ears.
F	SARAH	I get the feeling he doesn't like me very much.
M	JOHN	It takes him a while to warm up to people. Sarah considers this.
F	SARAH	Thanksgiving's tomorrow. Why don't you bring your dad and celebrate with us?
M	JOHN	I don't know. Are there going to be a lot of people?
F	SARAH	A tsunami of relatives. But don't worry, I'll shield you from the wave. Besides, I want everyone to meet you. She playfully splashes him. Their faces inch closer. They
M	HENRI	I've found the -- Caught in the act, the teens lurch away from each other.
M	JOHN	Just giving Bernie a quick bath.
M	HENRI	You're clearly putting a lot of effort into it.
F	SARAH	I better hit the road. See you tomorrow. Twoish. Bye, Mr. Smith. OFF John as she hustles out...
M	HENRI	I finally tracked the location of that blog. It's a house in Warsaw, Indiana. About four hours from here. I'm heading up there tomorrow.
M	JOHN	Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving. I told her we'd be there.
M	HENRI	Send my regrets.
M	JOHN	You shouldn't go alone. It could be dangerous.
M	HENRI	I won't risk taking you. I'll leave early and be back by five. John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude.
M	JOHN	Don't you ever get lonely? Surprised by the question, Henri swivels to face him.
M	HENRI	How could I? I have you.
M	JOHN	You know what I mean. All these years, there's never been anyone.
M	HENRI	We aren't like humans. Once we fall in love, it's for life. The pain of separation is unbearable. Henri's face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up.
M	JOHN	What was her name? Henri slots a plate onto the draining board.
M	HENRI	Anastasia.
M	JOHN	You left her to save me.
M	HENRI	You're not responsible for what happened to her -- they are. He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal concern.
M	HENRI	I looked at her the way you look at Sarah. She can't come with us when we leave -- and we always have to leave, you know that. John nods, not wanting to deal with that reality.
M	HENRI	I was hoping to protect you from that pain.
M	JOHN	You can't protect me from everything. OFF Henri's sad smile of acknowledgement...
F	SARAH	Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty.
F	SARAH	You look dazed.
M	JOHN	Just taking it all in. She crosses.
F	SARAH	I'm glad you came. They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming
M	ANNIE	Don't mind me. She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.
M	ANNIE	Let's get a picture of you two lovebirds. Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.
F	SARAH	Mom. No. John really doesn't like having his --
M	JOHN	It's okay. Let her take it. The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around John looks at his phone. No messages. His brow creases with
M	JOHN	I need to check in with Henri. He exits. Henri? CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials. Henri? Are you one of them too? John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone. Who are you? Where's Henri? CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it, I need your help.
F	SARAH	I'll see what's taking him so long.
F	SARAH	John! He looks back.
M	JOHN	It's Henri. I have to go. Sorry. OFF her confused disappointment as the truck SQUEALS away...
M	JOHN	Thanks. I owe you.
F	SAM	Anything to get out of Thanksgiving at my house. He offers John a weary smile.
F	SAM	I checked out that blog on the way over. Saw the video. What was the deal with your ankle? John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars.
M	JOHN	Death scars.
F	SAM	They kind of look like the symbols in my dad's research. You guys don't --
M	JOHN	Abduct people? No. Irritated, he covers them back up.
F	SAM	How about the ones you said were hunting you?
M	JOHN	They're capable of anything. We need to get to Warsaw -- now. Suddenly, John's cell phone RINGS. He snatches it up, but is
M	JOHN	Number 417. Henri tracked the URL to that house. Sam scans the street.
F	SAM	I don't see his SUV anywhere.
M	JOHN	He would have parked it across town. Sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver.
F	SAM	Stole it from Ed. Let's move. John yanks Sam's arm away from the door handle.
M	JOHN	I called you because I needed a ride, not a sidekick. If I could have run here, I would have. Go home. I'll call you when I get back. OFF Sam as John climbs out alone... He squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent
M	SAM (O.S.)	See anything? Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.
M	JOHN	I told you to go!
F	SAM	They might know where my dad is! John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back
M	CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.	It's lying on the counter by the fridge.
M	JOHN	Henri's here. John âturns offâ his palm and reaches for the door handle.
F	SAM	Wait! Other than strength, speed and night-light, what powers have you got?
M	JOHN	Telekinesis -- but that's a work in progress.
F	SAM	No invisibility, X-ray vision, flight?
M	JOHN	Sam, we drove here. Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up.
F	SAM	Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it. But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front
F	SAM	Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. There's a LOUD CLICK.
F	SAM	You just dead bolted it! Way to go!
M	JOHN	New plan -- follow Lucky Strike. Text me if he comes back. Sam sneaks off after Frank. TIGHT ON HIS SHOE as it brushes a mousetrap. SNAP! His breath catches in his throat. He âturns offâ his hand.
M	JOHN	Henri! He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG
M	THE BAT	whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who
M	BRET	knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto
M	HENRI	You shouldn't be here.
M	JOHN	Your life is my life, remember? Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze.
M	HENRI	I talked my way in. Thought the big guy was buying it. He rubs a wound on his neck.
M	HENRI	I was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind... some sort of animal tranq. I'm getting rusty. Suddenly, John's phone VIBRATES. It's a message from Sam --
M	JOHN	We have to leave! John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's
M	JOHN	Henri! Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
M	SAM AND FRANK	head down them into view. Frank holds the revolver against
M	FRANK	Stay planted or I'll blow your friend's head off. Henri looks at John in shock. He came to help. John and Henri put up their hands. John focuses on the gun, Henri body-slams Frank, sending the revolver skittering. But
M	THE KEYS	to the pickup fly out of Sam's pocket and slide under the On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's Sam looks over at John, impressed. You're the one from the video! You're the one they're after. With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against
M	JOHN	Tell me what you know! Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
M	JOHN	Start talking!
M	FRANK	I don't know what they're called. The one in the red coat said he'd kill me if I didn't do what he wanted. This revelation stuns Henri.
M	HENRI	The Mogadorians... they've been here? Frank nods in terror.
M	FRANK	He told me to call if anyone came asking about the video. Sweat beads John's face from the mental exertion.
M	JOHN	Did you? They wanted me to hold your friend until they got here. Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger.
M	HENRI	We need to go! Now! John âreleasesâ Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale John immediately extinguishes his palm. The trio stands Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
M	JOHN	Sam, get us out of here! Sam reaches into his jeans, then frantically checks his
F	SAM	I must have dropped the keys! Henri keeps his cool, looks at John.
M	HENRI	Start the engine.
M	JOHN	I can't. Henri's calm eyes never leave him.
M	HENRI	Yes, you can. John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes. climbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them.
F	SAM	Hurry up! John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The

M	FRANK	I called you like I said. It's not my fault they got away! The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	Where did they go? His accent is thick and his voice is unnerving.
M	FRANK	How should I know? The kid had me pinned to the ceiling. The Commander turns to Bret.
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	Where did they go? Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the
M	DOZENS OF TINY RAZOR-BLADES	suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin.
M	JOHN	We'll meet you back at the house.
M	HENRI	We're not going back to Paradise. Thank you for your help, but you'll never see us again. Henri climbs out. Sam looks at John, confused.
F	SAM	Is he serious? John nods, numb.
F	SAM	What am I supposed to tell people?
M	JOHN	Nothing. Forget about us. We never existed. Goodbye, Sam. OFF Sam as John climbs out...
M	HENRI	We leave at nightfall.
M	JOHN	Henri, this is insane. They still don't know where we live. Henri seethes.
M	HENRI	It's only a matter of time. They know our faces. They saw Sam. How long has he known?
M	JOHN	Since Halloween. Henri is floored and hurt by the admission.
M	HENRI	I trusted you and you lied to me! John bows his head, can't meet Henri's gaze.
M	JOHN	Only because I knew how you'd react and I didn't want to leave Paradise. Henri paces, tries to quell his emotions.
M	HENRI	Now we don't have a choice. The Mogs are using humans to trap us. From this point on -- no more towns. No more schools. We're going off the grid until we find the others.
M	JOHN	No. His tone is defiant.
M	HENRI	This isn't a discussion. In a flash of pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and
M	JOHN	I'm not leaving without saying goodbye to Sarah. Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare.
M	HENRI	Let. Me. Down. Spent, John releases Henri who slides to the floor, shaken.
M	HENRI	Give me your phone and IDs. John hands him his cell phone and wallet. Henri opens the

M	PHOTOGRAPHER	Hey, we've got a live one down here. When he spins back, the Girl is gone, vanished into thin air.
F	SARAH	Where is he, Sam?
F	SAM	I don't know. He tries to avoid eye contact, but she is determined.
F	SARAH	What happened last night? I've tried calling him all day. But his number's no longer in service.
F	SAM	Forget about him, Sarah. Incredulous, she grabs his arm.
F	SARAH	I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.
F	SAM	He left with Henri and he isn't coming back. Ever. I'm sorry. OFF Sarah, shattered... Taillights in five.
M	HENRI	John? No answer. He KNOCKS. Still nothing. OFF Henri's grim concern...
M	ANNIE	Little late for dessert.
M	JOHN	I need to talk to Sarah.
M	ANNIE	She's not here. Some friends dragged her to a party at Mark Jayne's. John absorbs this news, turns. Annie steps out after him.
M	ANNIE	I don't usually pry into my daughter's love life, I certainly didn't want my mother in mine -- but Sarah's my youngest and she's special to me.
M	JOHN	She's special to me too.
M	MARK	You weren't invited.
M	JOHN	Where's Sarah?
M	MARK	She doesn't want to see you. John shoves him aside and heads for the sweeping stairs...
M	JOCK	Everybody upstairs! Kevin's going for the beer bong record! The Teens immediately bolt for the stairs. In the giddy
M	A CANDLE	onto the white shag rug.
F	SARAH	John! She leaps up and hugs him. John waits as Emily exits.
M	JOHN	I'm sorry about last night. She pulls away, her relief turning to anger.
F	SARAH	No. Not good enough. Sam said you were never coming back. What are you doing here?
M	JOHN	I couldn't leave without seeing you one last time. She looks at him, crushed.
F	SARAH	So it's true. What's going on? What kind of trouble are you and your dad in?
M	JOHN	We're going to be fine.
F	SARAH	Damnit! Whatever it is, I'll understand -- just tell me the truth.
M	JOHN	The truth is I'm not who you think I am. You need to forget about me. Okay?
F	SARAH	Why are you acting like this?
M	JOHN	Because it's the only way to keep you safe.
F	SARAH	Safe from what? He turns away, shields her from his torment.
M	JOHN	Goodbye, Sarah. He doesn't look back as he walks out the door. CAMERA STAYS

M	THE STAIRCASE	is fully engulfed. Fearless, he clambers up the flaming
M	CRAAAACK!	The door rips off its hinges. Through the smoky half-light,
F	SARAH	John! Dozer's under the bed. He's too scared to come out! John strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and
M	JOHN	Don't let go of him. I promise I won't let go of you. As he lifts them... ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he
M	A BURNING BEAM	breaks free and swings down in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS,
M	JOHN	You okay? She stares at him, unsure.
F	SARAH	You walked through that fire without getting burned. I saw you stop that beam. SIRENS wail in the distance.
M	JOHN	I'll explain everything... but not here... Sarah... please? As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then Check this out, man! PUSH IN as Mark stares at the footage, stunned.
M	JOHN	Please don't look at me like that.
F	SARAH	I'm sorry. I'm still trying to process everything I saw and I keep coming to the same conclusion -- what you did isn't possible.
M	JOHN	It is for me.
F	SARAH	Who are you? For once please tell me the truth. It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do.
M	JOHN	My name isn't John. I don't have a name, just a number. 4. In fact, my whole life can be reduced to numbers: like 15 million -- that's how many light years it takes to get from my planet to Earth. 38 -- that's how many towns I've lived in. Or 3,671 -- that's how many days I've been running from an enemy that wants me dead. I lied to you, Sarah, because I lie to everyone. That's how I stay alive. Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul.
M	JOHN	I shouldn't be telling you any of this. It's dangerous. Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps
F	SARAH	I don't care. I just want to be with you.
M	JOHN	I want that too. But if I stay you could get hurt. I have to leave to keep you safe. Sarah absorbs the bitter reality, reaches for his hand.
F	SARAH	There's something I want to give you first. sharpens INTO FOCUS. It's the one Annie took of them at

M	THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	sitting in the back. His face is masked in shadow.
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	We're hunting for one of the guests at your party. He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	Do you know this boy?
M	MARK	Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't invite him.
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	He's a fugitive. We've been tracking him for some time. Mark smirks, vindicated.
M	MARK	I'll help you find him. He points to Sarah's image on the screen.
M	MARK	He's not at Sarah's, I already checked. And one of my dad's deputies drove by his house -- nada.
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	He poses a great threat to us. Where else could he be? Mark pulls out his cell phone.
M	MARK	I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe you guys can trace it? The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	Tell me everything you know about John Smith.
M	HENRI	John's not at the house. Is he here?
F	SAM	No, but he's all over the internet.
M	HENRI	I know. He turns back to his SUV. Sam follows.
F	SAM	Those things from Warsaw -- they're coming, aren't they?
M	HENRI	Go back inside. This isn't your fight.
F	SAM	The hell it isn't. I'm coming with you. OFF this declaration... Hello. She listens, then hands John the phone.
F	SARAH	It's Henri. Where are you?
M	JOHN	High school.
M	HENRI	Get out now! At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the
M	JOHN	Too late... they're here.
M	MARK	What the hell's in there? He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the
M	MARK	You guys aren't FBI. Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck
M	TWO BANDOLIERS	over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal struts into view. We RECOGNIZE her as the mysterious Teen
M	MOGADORIAN SOLDIER	who was stalking up the hall behind them! John watches in
M	SIX	You oughta keep your heroics off the internet.
M	JOHN	Who the hell are you?
M	SIX	Number 6. Where's your Cepan?
M	JOHN	On his way. Where's yours?
M	SIX	Dead. The Mogs got her four months ago. We had been tracking them. She heads past. John and Sarah follow after her.
M	JOHN	Tracking them?
M	SIX	We discovered they plan to attack Earth. The only thing standing in their way is the six of us. The revelation hits John like a wrecking ball.
M	SIX	You know what that means? John nods with new purpose.
M	JOHN	The war starts tonight.
M	SIX	First we have to get out of here alive and find the others. Six leads them past the impressive trophy case.
M	JOHN	What are we up against?
M	SIX	There's a commander, a bunch of soldiers and two Piken. They'll have all the main entrances covered.
F	SARAH	The gym, there's a tunnel under the stage.
M	JOHN	It'll take us out to the stadium. Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers
F	SARAH	We're invisible. John realizes, turns to Six.
M	JOHN	You got any other Legacies?
M	SIX	I can control the elements. You?
M	JOHN	Lumen and telekinesis. More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the
M	MARK.	He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch herself from
M	SIX	Stay put. They want to draw you out.
M	JOHN	He's not dying because of me! ANGLE ON THE SOLDIERS AND MARK. They're heading past the
M	JOHN (O.S.)	Mark! Linoleum! Now! Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
M	HENRI, SAM AND BERNIE	sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians! Six Barricade the doors! John telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly
F	SARAH	What are you doing with them?
M	MARK	They said they were FBI. That John was a fugitive. What the hell's going on?
M	SIX	You've stumbled into a war. So shut up and keep your head down.
M	HENRI	I see age hasn't mellowed your attitude, 6. Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.
M	MARK	I didn't know they were trying to kill you. I'm sorry.
M	JOHN	This isn't your fault -- it's mine. He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie
F	SAM	What is it, boy? Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes...
M	HENRI	He's telling us to run! They take off a second before
M	A PIKEN	PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and
M	JOHN	Bernie! He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns.
M	HENRI	Bernie's a Chimera. He came with us from Lorien.
M	JOHN	Guess I wasn't the only one keeping secrets.
M	HENRI	Somebody had to watch you when I wasn't around. They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.
F	SARAH	The gym's this way. A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
M	JOHN	sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that
M	JOHN	Go! Go! Go! They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
M	THE SPRINKLER HEADS	that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
M	SIX IS WAITING.	BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
M	SIX	Keep moving! Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward. In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
F	SARAH	Where's John?
M	HENRI	Right behind us. He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when
M	A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER	steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
M	ERUPTS!	Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
M	SIX	They've blocked it. Use your telekinesis.
M	JOHN	We're not leaving without my friends.
M	SIX	Don't you mean the girl? John ignores the jibe and turns back. Six grabs his arm.
M	SIX	I broke the Elders' spell to find you. The Mogs can kill me now. We have to go.
M	JOHN	We stay and fight. OFF his determination...
M	HENRI	You know how to use one of these?
M	MARK	My dad's the sheriff. He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing
M	JOHN	Save it for the Mogs. Let's go! Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the desperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's
M	JOHN	The door's over here. The tunnel leads out to the stadium. Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
M	TWO MOGADORIANS	spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over
M	SIX.	She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.
M	SIX	Saving your life. My new hobby. Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and Get her down the tunnel! They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel.
M	A MOGADORIAN	lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
F	SAM	I play a lot of Xbox.
M	JOHN	Don't stop! Get to the woods! She nods and exits with the others. John and Henri head onto the field after them when
M	THE SECOND PIKEN	leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
M	HENRI	nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
M	JOHN	Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo! The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench. ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
M	JOHN	Henri. Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
M	JOHN	Come on, taillights in five.
M	HENRI	I won't be coming with you this time. Save yourself.
M	JOHN	We go together! Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters
M	HENRI	Find the others. His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.
M	HENRI	Your life is my life... always. His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
M	THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.	But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	Number 4. Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	Your Cepan saved you on Lorien. The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He
M	MOGADORIAN COMMANDER	But this moment was inevitable. The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it. ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which
M	JOHN	Nothing is inevitable. The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every
M	SUPERNOVA OF FIRE	that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell.
F	SARAH	Oh my God... John. Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting
F	SARAH	John! She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope.
F	SARAH	John! Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap
F	SARAH	Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't cover extraterrestrial dagger wounds. Six smiles, grateful.
M	SIX	Thanks. As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
M	MARK	The Sheriff's Department is starting to put up roadblocks. You guys better get moving. Six and Sarah join them.
M	JOHN	You good to go?
M	SIX	Don't worry about me. John nods to Sam.
M	JOHN	Sam, ride with Six.
M	SIX	We don't need baggage. Sam steps in front of her, determined.
F	SAM	I have to find out if the Mogs took my dad. Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.
M	SIX	You slow us down, I'll shoot you myself. Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.
F	SARAH	I want to come too.
M	JOHN	You need to stay here.
F	SARAH	Why?
M	JOHN	You could have died last night. I'm not putting you in danger again. Mark's promised to look after you. Tears tumble down her cheeks.
F	SARAH	I don't want to say goodbye.
M	JOHN	I'll come back for you.
F	SARAH	When?
M	JOHN	When it's safe. She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.
M	JOHN	Where I'm from, we only give our heart to one person. I've given mine to you. I love you, Sarah. Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
M	BERNIE KOSAR	limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
M	JOHN (V.O.)	This is the first town I've left without Henri. The first one I have a reason to come back to. John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to He warned me the pain would be unbearable if I left her. He was right.
M	JOHN (V.O.)	But I don't regret it. The pain reminds me what's at stake. A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.
M	JOHN (V.O.)	We must find the others and face our enemy together. I'm not sure how we can stop them. But nothing is inevitable. I know that now. Thunderheads darken the horizon. I am Number 4. His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
