M	CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
M	EXTREME CLOSE ON A CELL PHONE	resting face up on a black surface. A beat of silence -- is a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table, empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure hunched over a laptop. Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a gentle, intelligent demeanor. Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of
M	JONATHAN	Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet? The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.
M	OLD MAN	It is tomorrow.
M	JONATHAN	Right. I forgot. The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous
M	OLD MAN	Anything else?
M	JONATHAN	Uh - no. No that's it, thanks. floor marked by unlit neon: "FLEURS DE SOLANGE." He ascends the steps, his keys out --
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Jonathan! The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find SOLANGE (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,
M	JONATHAN	Solange, you're up so late?
F	SOLANGE	So early, Jonathan. We open in one hour. So tell me, you have been out with a lady friend, oui? Je suis desole, madame, mais no.
F	SOLANGE	But why else does a young man come home at such an hour?
M	JONATHAN	Just working late, that's all.
F	SOLANGE	Every night working late, working late. Ah, you can't fool me. You are Mister Mischief maker - I know this! You come by
M	SOLANGE (CONT'D)	later and pick out something for your lady friend, oui?
M	JONATHAN (0.S.)	Excuse me. Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely
M	LAWYER 1	So, the Knicks win last night?
M	LAWYER 2	I'm pretty sure, yeah.
M	JONATHAN	Actually, they lost by 4. Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.
M	JONATHAN	It was supposed to be a good game though.
M	LAWYER 1	Oh. Hey, so. did you get a chance to look over that memo from Watkins?
M	CONTINUED:	politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return. beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post- its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming array of numbers and data with methodical assurance. Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before divider to his right startles him. He peers down and over, to
M	JONATHAN	Yes? Take a look at this. The voice sounds youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	The Japanese are developing a toilet that can analyze your urine for glucose levels, kidney disease, even cancer. They're referring to it as the "super bowl."
M	JONATHAN	That certainly is - something.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	Of course if you've ever been to Japan, you know they're nuts about their toilets. I'm talking web sites, symposiums... Jonathan chuckles.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	You think I'm kidding. They have bowls over there that cost more than a piano. What I want to know is how you're supposed to retrieve this analysis - you know, from your super bowl.
M	JONATHAN	Maybe they're developing a fly with a nursing degree. A superfly. Who's in there anyway?
M	JONATHAN	Uh, Jonathan Messer. Messer... What department?
M	JONATHAN	None. I'm from Worth and Berman. I've been over here a few wee-- A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound of
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	So you're an accountant? Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.
M	JONATHAN	Audit manager, yeah.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires Worth and Berman to give their blessing to our books, and they send you?
M	JONATHAN	Have laptop, will travel. What about you?
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	What about me?
M	JONATHAN	Well, I didn't get your name for one.th-- The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	.ose.
M	JONATHAN	Sorry - I didn't catch that? Hello...?
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	I said it's Wyatt. Wyatt Bose. Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door -
M	COMPUVOICE (SOUND ADVANCE)	Message-four. Three-oh-eight-pee-em.
M	PETERSON (O.S.)	Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to- confirm you're wrapping up over there at Rutherford Stern because the controller at Clancey has been on me to get someone in there by Thursday. I told him how brilliant you are, said you're the best auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you some documentation... Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27 a-mails ending in day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week. Other than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank.
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.)	12:53 a.m. Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the'
M	WYATT	Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home and saw the lights. We met before, in the can...
M	JONATHAN	Sure. It's Wyatt, right? WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something very likeably "on" about him.
M	WYATT	So do you normally work this late?
M	JONATHAN	Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to finish up. What about you?
M	WYATT	You kidding? This is an early night. Hard to believe that once upona time a man's success was measured by how little he had to work. You know in Sweden the average worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation? Do-you like accounting?
M	JONATHAN	It's all right, if you enjoy working with numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?
M	WYATT	It's all right. If you enjoy working with assholes. Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.
M	WYATT	Well, I'm probably disturbing you -
M	JONATHAN	No - it's okay. Really.
M	WYATT	So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have to like be in Mensa to work there? Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly.
M	WYATT	Been with them long?
M	JONATHAN	Since my senior year of college. They subsidized my graduate degree.
M	WYATT	Really. So you were poor? Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question. S.
M	JONATHAN	Well - I guess you could say that. I was raised by a single mother, and she died when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people have had it worse.
M	WYATT	Not around here. Practically every suit I know is Harvard by way of Andover.
M	JONATHAN	Are you?
M	WYATT	Me? Hell no... I'm Princeton. By way of Exeter. Jonathan laughs. Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces.
M	WYATT	So. Jonathan. What do you say to a break? CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH. Tilt up from Jonathan's laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint, staring out at the rain hammering the far windows. .It's just sometimes I feel so - I don't know - removed. I mean, I work for one of the biggest accounting firms in the world, and.there's not so much as a desk there to prove it? They've decided all we need are cell phones and laptops. Messages are voice-mailed, documents e-mailed, salary's deposited online. Chet Peterson, my senior manager? I swear he wouldn't recognize me if I was sitting in his chair. Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts:
M	JONATHAN	I don't know... I used to have friends. But it's like I've spent so much time trying to prove myself, working these hours - you can only do it so long before you look up and realize you've lost
M	JONATHAN (CONT'D)	everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With everyone... And I try to meet people at work. I do. But it's always the same. To the accounting staff I'm a pain because for two weeks they have to hold their breath and hope I don't pick up on any of their screw ups. And to everyone else, I'm just a temporary fixture, so why bother? The truth is, this is the first meaningful conversation I've had in I don't know how long. It's like if I disappeared tomorrow, I'm not .sure anyone other than Solange would even notice - she's my neighbor. I live on what must be the only block in Brooklyn that still isn't hip. I guess I just never counted-on the isolation. It's like sometimes I look through that glass, and I see life literally passing me by. Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence.
M	WYATT	Jonathan?
M	JONATHAN	Yeah?
M	WYATT	By the clock on the wall there? You've just talked for 37 minutes straight. Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up. Jonathan hesitates, laughter filling the expansive room -- until it's drowned by the SOUND ADVANCE OF POURING RAIN... he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat, clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street. and she's DRENCHED. But she seems content to entertain herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the umbrella in front of her. Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the subway below reminds him he'd better move. JONATHAN'S POV: the entire station is a blur, all unfocused, - until his glasses return his POV to immediate focus, and he dollar bills in her hand, entering the station. Jonathan can't help but stare again. Despite her business attire, there's an almost childlike lightness. to her step. Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can make out the first letter of a monogram: "S." She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers waiting, then decides life's too short. She continues past, headed for the turnstiles. Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase, then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow gap in the turnstile. A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement. collection - and slips out of view. ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still stuck on line, staring at the space she vacated. Weary and still a bit stoned, Jonathan peers sleepily into the dark expanse of tunnel, yawns - And then he sees "S" is waiting on the same platform. Ten The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN. "S" heads for it, Jonathan follows... The train halts. The door before him is the last of its car, the door before her the first of the next. The doors open.
M	II S â¢ II	Excuse me, is this the train for canal Street? It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice. She's even more arresting up close.
M	JONATHAN	Uh,.either one is -- I mean the N and the R both stop there so, you know, either way, I mean, this is the right train. Yes. SOS Of Thanks. "S" enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her He can see 'S'. She sits in the other car chewing her gum. He
M	CONDUCTOR (O.S.)	Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next. He sees "S" rising to join the small crowd gathering by a door. Jonathan stands up - his last chance. Determined, he braces The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into "CANAL ST. A sudden JOLT of the braking train.causes Jonathan to stumble phone a few feet along the grimy floor. O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs for his phone a second before it's stepped on. He hurriedly stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet - Devastated, he hurries to a window, searching the platform as
M	JONATHAN	I guess that's it. then. Nice meeting you.
M	ASSISTANT CONTROLLER	Uh huh. Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back.
M	JONATHAN	Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt Bose's office? The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance.
M	JONATHAN	Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here. She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's
M	A GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)	Hey, quit looking down her shirt! Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to
M	WYATT	Leaving, huh? So where to next?
M	JONATHAN	Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols after that. Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in
M	WYATT	Hey, wait up a sec. Well, good meeting you, Jonathan. ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer. Wait, so you have off tomorrow? Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall.
M	WYATT	You don't happen to have .a. decent backhand, do you? Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his
M	SAME SCENE - LATER	A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two inches outside the opposite baseline.
M	WYATT	Out!
M	CONTINUED:	Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air. Silence - then Wyatt's SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space.
M	WYATT	Commiserations, Messer. Good game. They shake hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted. Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat the crap out of me. Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter.
M	WYATT	They asked if we'd fancy a post-game cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it. Jonathan is barely able to speak.
M	JONATHAN	Oh? I would've been happy to.
M	WYATT	Are you kidding? They're a couple of first years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do better. Hey, you OK? Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet.
M	WYATT	Man, I remember when these first came out. I think I was a frosh at boarding school. Jeez, are these strings natural gut?
M	JONATHAN	Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I should replace them, they're all frayed... Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar. From behind, it looks remarkably like "S"... Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise.
M	WYATT	Have you ever considered contacts? Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face -
M	JONATHAN	Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was allergic to something in the solution.
M	WYATT	Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your eyes especially. Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel.
M	WYATT	It's not a come on, just an observation. You don't get much, do you.
M	JONATHAN	What - you mean sex?
M	WYATT	No, flood insurance. How many women have you slept with?
M	JONATHAN	Oh, I don't know, not a whole-
M	WYATT	Of course you know. Everyone knows.
M	JONATHAN	Maybe - four.
M	WYATT	Maybe four?
M	JONATHAN	Okay fine, just four. What about you?
M	WYATT	Me? I have no idea.
M	JONATHAN	What? You just said everyone -
M	WYATT	I meant everyone like you. Confused, Jonathan looks up -- as Wyatt disappears into a shower stall.
M	SAME - MOMENTS LATER	Jonathan emerges freshly showered, a towel around his waist
M	WYATT (O.S.)	Tonight?... Fine. I'm on the list? Jonathan finds Wyatt half-dressed, seated on a bench by a locker and talking on his cell phone.
M	WYATT	There better be. Wyatt hangs up, looks up to find Jonathan staring, puzzled.
M	WYATT	Something wrong? Jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket, and
M	JONATHAN	We have the same phone.
M	WYATT	Oh - and you thought I was using yours? I can afford my own phone calls, you know.
M	JONATHAN	No, I wasn't -- of course you can-
M	WYATT	I'm pulling your dick, Jonathan. Actually, I was just firming up some plans for tonight. Are you free? Me? Sure, I guess - but I don't want to
M	WYATT	You're not. What do you say, are you in?
M	JONATHAN	I guess I could go home and change.
M	WYATT	To Brooklyn? Forget it, you can borrow something of mine.
M	WYATT	t a uten Abend, Herr Kleiner. This way, Jonathan. young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.
M	WYATT	Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he hooked me up with the gallery in Munich. Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders, pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair bleached blonde and loosely spiked.
M	WYATT (O.S.)	Talk about a bad look. Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right
M	WYATT	Here, try this one. What?
M	JONATHAN	Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off.
M	WYATT	You hope you can pull it off. You know who you remind me of? James Getz.
M	JONATHAN	Who?
M	WYATT	A guy I roomed with freshman year at Princeton.. Real smart - witty too, when you loosened him up. Only from day one, he just didn't fit in. For starters, he was dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there was always this boundary - this wall - between Getz and everyone else. You could argue we laid the foundation, but he built it. Built it by believing the lie.
M	JONATHAN	What lie?
M	WYATT	That he was any different. The clothes, the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all one big masquerade. Anyone can get in, you've just got to wear a costume. But Getz never got that. He assumed he could never scale the wall, when the truth is he was the only one guarding it. It never occurred to him his anonymity could be an asset. No one gets over like the guy who's just a face, an impression. We are - all of us - only who we're perceived to be.
M	JONATHAN	So what happened to him?
M	WYATT	Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.
M	JONATHAN	You're pulling my dick, aren't you. Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks.
M	WYATT	With both hands. Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit. CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat.
M	EMCEE	And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine, the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour! sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease. Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience.
M	WYATT	It's a little self-conscious, but I thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's that suit working out?
M	JONATHAN	Oh - great, actually.
M	WYATT	Keep it then. I've got two just like it. Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives.
M	WAITRESS	Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen.
M	JONATHAN	Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass?
M	WYATT	We'll try not to spill any. So what's the wildest thing you've ever done? Sexually, I mean.
M	JONATHAN	The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've never been too adventuresome.
M	WYATT	All right, what's the lamest thing then?
M	JONATHAN	The lamest... Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it.
M	JONATHAN	Actually, that was probably a few months ago. I was flipping through money magazine and saw this small ad in the back. It read something like "Are. you feeling all alone? Looking to meet women but have forgotten how?" And-there was this number.
M	WYATT	And you called it? So what happened?
M	JONATHAN	Nothing actually. The phone just kept ringing. And that's it. Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up.
M	JONATHAN	Lame enough for you?
M	WYATT	You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine. That is beyond lame. Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then
M	JONATHAN	.Hello? Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE
M	JONATHAN	.All right... Goodbye. Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt.
M	JONATHAN	She wants to dance. Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan returning alone, looking deflated.
M	JONATHAN	She's a hooker. Wyatt shrugs, grinning.
M	JONATHAN	Hold on - you knew? What - are all the women here prostitutes?
M	WYATT	That depends on what you mean by that word. Stretch the definition and you could incorporate most of the men as well. You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only belong to a union, they have to pay taxes.
M	JONATHAN	You seem to possess quite a store of international trivia.
M	WYATT	Not really. I just get around... Jonathan, relax. It's not like she just shot your dog. I was only trying to help. Besides, what are you looking for - a relationship? As if you have time for one? This was your first day off in how long?
M	JONATHAN	Three weeks.
M	WYATT	Four for me. Face it, we've mortgaged our youth. Pimped out our twenties. But we still have needs. And there's nothing shameful about wanting them met.
M	JONATHAN	So you sleep with hookers? Me? Never.
M	JONATHAN	So how do you - meet your needs? Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl.
M	WYATT	What if I told you... Christ, I sound like an infommercial.
M	JONATHAN	What were you going to say?
M	WYATT	Listen. You don't think that women have these same urges? Young women, just like ourselves, successful and working their asses off to stay that way? You better believe they do.
M	JONATHAN	And?
M	WYATT	And - well - let's just say, there's a way...a way it can be taken care of.
M	JONATHAN	You make it sound like a mob hit. Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show.
M	JONATHAN	What you were talking about, before. Peoples' needs... Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin:
M	WYATT	Some other time.
M	WYATT (CONT'D)	At the corner, please. The Rhiga Royal. Listen, I have to meet someone.. Oh... okay. The cab pulls up before the RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL.
M	WYATT	Hey. You had a good time tonight?
M	JONATHAN	Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks.
M	WYATT	I'm glad. Listen, that thing with the hooker, I'm really sorry if I -
M	JONATHAN	Forget it. It was funny. Wyatt smiles warmly, pats Jonathan's shoulder.
M	WYATT	I'll give you a call tomorrow. Wyatt climbs out. Jonathan watches through the cab window as
M	JONATHAN	Hey. Could you let me out at the next corner over there, on 7th Avenue? Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted to the spot,.hoping he'll see that face in the crowd. and heads down into the-subway. Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger, pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its.
M	CLANCEY CONTROLLER	Any problems, you'll want to see Julie Levinson, she's our assistant controller - or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior accountant. If Werner's unavailable, we have two staff accountants - but like I said, I don't anticipate any problems. I mean we've never had any before, so...
M	JONATHAN	Right.I just need the access codes for the accounts and sub-accounts? The Controller suddenly looks uneasy.
M	JONATHAN	You've got account numbers, but no access codes. Without those I can't get the banks to authorize statement verification. Besides, how else can I steal the money?
M	CLANCEY CONTROLLER	What?
M	JONATHAN	Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I do need those codes though, when you get a chance. conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall. CLOSE ON A BUSINESS CARD: a Rutherford Stern masthead, beneath it Wyatt's name and office number. Jonathan picks up
M	WYATT (O.S.)	Hey, Jonathan.
M	JONATHAN	How'd you know it was- You really ought to block your caller ID. So - same place as yesterday? we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite.
M	WYATT	I wonder what the Founding Fathers would make of this scene. Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat.
M	JONATHAN	I'm just glad to be outside. I've got to tell you, this has been great, meeting up for lunch. I used to just- A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's
M	WYATT	Yes?... Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme on the 6:15 out of JFK tonight... Fine. Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's.
M	WYATT	London to paper some financing with Lloyds. I tell you about this?
M	JONATHAN	No - no you didn't.
M	WYATT	Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks. Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in.
M	JONATHAN	Sounds exciting.
M	WYATT	Nah, it'll be boring as sin. Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises from the ledge.
M	WYATT	Shit, I'd better get back. You ready? He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded message. He hangs up -- when it abruptly RINGS, surprising him. He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it.
M	JONATHAN	Jonathan Mess- CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat - then
M	SECRETARY 1	.That's just it. You caught him in a lie, so now everything he says you have to- RING of a cell phone. RING... RING... It's Jonathan's. Surprised, he takes out the phone, presses talk.
M	JONATHAN	Hello? A soft, electronic rustle from the other end... then:
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Are you free tonight?
M	JONATHAN	Excuse me?
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	I asked if you're free tonight.
M	JONATHAN	I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong-- CLICK. The line goes dead.
M	JONATHAN	Hello? The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other end. Then:
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Are you free tonight?
M	JONATHAN	Actually I am, but I don't think I'm who The static on the other end worsens.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	I'm sorry, I didn't get that?
M	JONATHAN	I said I am free, but I - Could you be at the Plaza in one hour?
M	JONATHAN	The hotel? I - I guess, but -
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S'.)	Beneath the Eloise portrait. THE ROAR OF A TRAIN pulling in. Only when the train passes Jonathan stares at his cell phone - and frowns. Close on the phone's display as Jonathan scrolls down its list of stored numbers. His expression says none are familiar. And NOW he gets it.
M	JONATHAN	Hi, it's Jonathan, I've got your cell! I guess you must have mine. I imagine you're in the air now, but call when you get this. if you do. Oh, and you got a call from someone who I'm...forget it, just call me. Jonathan hangs up.
M	CABBIE	So where ya visiting from?
M	JONATHAN	Excuse me?
M	CABBIE	You're from out of town, right? Me? No.
M	CABBIE	Huh. I can usually tell. You seem like a tourist.
M	JONATHAN	I've lived here all my life!
M	CABBIE	No offence, pal. The cabbie pulls over on Central Park South. Jonathan leans
M	CABBIE	Well, here ya are. The Plaza. Jonathan anxiously wanders the perimeter, then slows as he spies a PORTRAIT OF A PRECOCIOUS LITTLE GIRL grinning at him. Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait,
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Pardon me, but may I ask you something - personal? Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an
M	THE BLONDE	Are you waiting for me?
M	JONATHAN	I - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt, right?
M	THE BLONDE	Excuse me? I'm sorry, did we speak earlier?
M	JONATHAN	Yes. Yes we did -
M	THE BLONDE	Good. Let's go then. Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the
M	JONATHAN	Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and I., we don't know each other...? She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips.
M	THE BLONDE	No fooling. DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows.
M	THE HALLWAY	Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The
M	JONATHAN	What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain there's been some kind of mistake. She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him.
M	THE BLONDE	You're not who I spoke with on the phone?
M	JONATHAN	No - I mean, yes, but -
M	THE BLONDE	You're not attracted to me?
M	JONATHAN	Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just -
M	THE BLONDE	It's just what... exactly? She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long. tentativeness is all but gone. Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language:
M	THE BLONDE	Fuck. LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of she's fast asleep. alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads: 6:18 am.
M	DESK CLERK	Sir, I'm showing that room as having checked out at 6:20 this morning.
M	JONATHAN	Well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there?
M	DESK CLERK	I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose information regarding our guests. If you give me her name, I can confirm if she was registered here.
M	JONATHAN	Actually, the thing is... it's okay. Forget it. He starts to walk. His cell RINGS. He answers.
M	JONATHAN	Hello?
M	WYATT'S VOICE	Hey, you're up early!
M	JONATHAN	Hi! How's London?
M	WYATT'S VOICE	Raining. So you've got mine-and I've.got yours?
M	JONATHAN	Yeah. Listen, last night...um...I met this-
M	WYATT'S VOICE	Damn! Sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, they want me in a meeting. Hey, no long distance calls, okay! Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a The numbers stored have no names associated with them. It's just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list of phone numbers that seems to go on and on. Jonathan clicks on a number at random. It highlights itself.
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)	Yes?
M	JONATHAN	Hello, um - I'm sorry to bother you -
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.O.)	How did you get this number?
M	JONATHAN	Through a friend.
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)	I think you've got the wrong number. Now if you'll excuse me -
M	JONATHAN	wait - Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up.
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.O.)	Yes? CLOSE ON JONATHAN. What to say? And then:
M	JONATHAN	Are you free tonight? He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up. A long silence.
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)	I can be. Jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief.
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)	Where?
M	JONATHAN	Where. Right... The Plaza?
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)	I'm afraid that's a bit uptown for me. Perhaps the Mercer? Say by the Shakespeare, half past eleven?
M	JONATHAN	The Shakespeare?
M	BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)	It should be fairly evident.
M	JONATHAN (O.S.)	Excuse me, um - I'm sorry to disturb you - She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in her hand.
M	JONATHAN	I'm - supposed to meet someone here and-
M	BRITISH ACCENT	You're rather new to this, aren't you? Jonathan falters. She smiles.
M	BRITISH ACCENT	That's okay. I like that.
M	LOBBY ELEVATOR	She enters first, then Jonathan. He waits for her.to push a button - only it seems she's waiting for him to do the same.
M	JONATHAN	I'm sorry, what floor? She rolls her eyes.
M	BACK TO THE HOTEL LOBBY	Jonathan and British Accent cross the lobby once more.
M	BRITISH ACCENT	Frankly I'm surprised that whoever gave you access didn't explain more. Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no jobs - no nothing. Two, latex is mandatory and non-negotiable.. Three, no rough stuff - the only rule that's even remotely malleable provided there's mutual consent, although I say if that's your thing, take it elsewhere. And finally... She halts a few feet from the registration desk.
M	BRITISH ACCENT	The initiator is responsible for the room.
M	JONATHAN	Oh - so I should...?
M	BRITISH ACCENT	Precisely.
M	BACK IN THE ELEVATOR	Jonathan is holding a key card. British Accent is leaning
M	JONATHAN	So are there a lot of - people - who do this? She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when
M	BRITISH ACCENT	How did you get into this?
M	JONATHAN	Well, a friend of mine -
M	BRITISH ACCENT	He uploaded your numbers but failed to explain the basics?
M	JONATHAN	He's - well, he was going out of town. I'm doing something wrong, aren't I?
M	BRITISH ACCENT	It's not that, it's just... well, you strike me as something of a stowaway. In fact if I were more suspicious, I'd say you didn't belong here at all. Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation ---
M	BRITISH ACCENT	But obviously somebody felt you did. The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt!
M	BRITISH ACCENT	And I'm a sucker for bashful boys... She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm... and removes the key card from his hand. control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride.
M	JONATHAN	Can I ask you something? Why do you do this?
M	BRITISH ACCENT	Why are any of us doing this? For the economics of the arrangement. It's intimacy without intricacy. Jonathan's about to reply --
M	BRITISH ACCENT	Look, I've got a 7 a.m. breakfast, so... She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat.
M	JONATHAN	Well - good night. She doesn't reply.
M	JONATHAN	Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess you're busy.with stuff over there. I've been kinda busy too! I've been wondering - did you mean for me to take your phone? where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night.
M	JONATHAN (V.0.)	I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can see you grinning right now. Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps inside --
M	JONATHAN (V.0.)	Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you. SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SWELLING: to herald a MONTAGE: now he doesn't bother looking up. In his briefcase, we note the inclusion of a toiletries bag.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Can you hold these? Her eyes fix on his as he.nears - a flash of mutual recognition... then nothing as they pass without a word. Jonathan can't help but allow himself the slightest grin. something. She looks up, confused --- -- when ANOTHER REDHEAD taps his shoulder. Her free hand to Jonathan and YET ANOTHER WOMAN having sex. The bed glass FALLS, HITS the ground and BREAKS. He continues toward us, hair slicked back, like Wyatt's.
F	SOLANGE	Jonathan, for so long I don't see you!
M	JONATHAN	J'ai ete tres occupe. with work. He's exhausted. And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly activities.
F	SOLANGE	Work? No, no. You believe you can trick me, Mr. Mischief Maker! I want to meet this lady friend of yours. Jonathan is about to protest -
F	SOLANGE	Ah., ah - ecoutez, I have beautiful winter- roses, just. arrived. She.will swoon... Jonathan smiles, but there's a reticence to it.
M	JONATHAN	Maybe later, okay?
F	SOLANGE	There is no later when it comes to love! If you find it, you must not let it go. Jonathan nods absently, continues up the steps - when she
F	SOLANGE	There really is no one? Jonathan evasively shakes his head.
F	SOLANGE	There should be, Jonathan. It is not good for a young man to be too much alone. He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as .and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out
F	WOMAN	Excuse me... He doesn't breathe. Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm... It's her. -It's "S". remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the Jonathan is about to say something but can't. She undoes the next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the next --
M	JONATHAN	Before we...um, the thing is - I know you. She glances up, curious - her hand lingering by the front
M	JONATHAN	Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met before. In the Times Square subway station. It was raining... In the subway?
M	JONATHAN	You had no umbrella. You were soaked.
M	âC,.	It's true, I don't have an umbrella.
M	JONATHAN	Then you asked me if the N train stops at Canal. She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles
M	JONATHAN	Wait.
M	âSÂ»	Is something the matter?
M	JONATHAN	This just seems strange, that's all.
M	SÂ	Because you've seen me before?
M	JONATHAN	Maybe. I don't know, it's just - Ever since that night on the train, I've thought about how nice it would be to see you again. And now suddenly, here you are, taking off your clothes. â S of Bingo! So what's the problem?
M	JONATHAN	It's just that-
M	"S,1	Hmm, it is kind of a gear-shift. She starts to button her blouse back up.
M	âSâ	Well, maybe some other time. Jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat -
M	JONATHAN	Wait - don't go. She glances back curiously.
M	JONATHAN	What I mean is, by any chance... are you hungry? He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper. We can hear the sound of JONATHAN AND "S" TALKING AND LAUGHING... meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously. You have some ketchup on your chin.
M	JONATHAN	sorry, I'm a messy eater. âsâ Me too. Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes
M	JONATHAN	Thanks.
M	CONTINUED:	They continue to eat for a while, eyeing each other between bites. Um, I think there's a little piece of... âSr. .onion in my hair? She laughs and flicks it.off. Hmm...they get everywhere.
M	JONATHAN	By the way, my name's-
M	âS,.	Don't! She puts her finger to his lips. A first touch. An electricity between them.
M	âC/,	You know the rules. No names.
M	JONATHAN	The 'rules' seem to specify no conversation either.
M	as.,	They are a little rigid, aren't they? But I think we should obey the 'no names'. It'll be fun!
M	JONATHAN	Ah, but I know.yours begins with an 'S'. âSir Is that right?
M	JONATHAN	I saw part of the monogram on your briefcase. ./ S If I see-Excellent work, Holmes. Maybe I'll tell you if.you guess... Her face is an inch from his, the moment mysterious and sexy.
M	JONATHAN	Hmrn...what do we know of her? She sports a camel coat, a briefcase and possesses no umbrella. I deduce...her name is 'Sybil'. 'S' laughs.
M	JONATHAN	Sarah? Sara? Samantha? Sandra? Susan? She makes a little sound of encouragement. Hun...
M	JONATHAN	Aha! Sue? Suzie with a 'z'? You're saying my name is 'Suzie'?
M	JONATHAN	is it?
M	âSâ¢â	Nape. Jonathan laughs.
M	JONATHAN	I've got to tell you, I'm much better with numbers... How about Sonia? Sheena? Wait - Sophie! You're definitely a Sophie.
M	âS.	With an 'ie' or a 'y'?
M	JONATHAN	Either.
M	W7	Neither.
M	JONATHAN	How about Syd? As in Syd Charisse? She was Cyd with a 'C'!
M	JONATHAN	But maybe you spell it with an 'S'? ,, S . If I do not.
M	JONATHAN	Steffi? Sexy Steffi soaking in the:rain?. She mock-frowns.
M	âS.,,	Nein.
M	JONATHAN	Sally? Sally with three 'l's? She shakes her head, amused. Jonathan rubs his chin.
M	JONATHAN	Hmmm. Hmmm. The mysterious 'S' alighted from the train at Canal Street. She may well be from 'downtown'...hmm...ah! Of course! How foolish I've been; Sinead. 'S' giggles, charmed by him.
M	JONATHAN	Stella? Sky? Sunbeam?
M	Â»S.,,	Do I look like a 'Sunbeam'?
M	JONATHAN	Absolutely. To me you are 'Sunbeam'.
M	âS.,,	Then so be it. Jonathan considers this a moment, and concedes.
M	JONATHAN	Can I ask what you do for a living? You first.
M	JONATHAN	I sit behind glass and watch people pass like fish. She smiles - a more interesting answer than she expected.
M	ALSIP	You work in a bank?
M	JONATHAN	Nahh, I'm... I'm kind of an accountant. us,, Now I bet that's just what you wanted to do when you were a kid!
M	JONATHAN	Oh yeah. I'm living the dream. Feel free to leave now. u S â Still here.
M	JONATHAN	So what about you?
M	âSÂ»	No, we're still on you, Frank. Off Jonathan's look, 'Frank'?
M	âS.11	You look like a Frank. So, Frank, when you were a little boy, what did you wanna be when you grew up? .Jonathan thinks. Confesses:
M	JONATHAN	A pro tennis player.
M	âS,.	Huh! I wanted to be an umpire.
M	JONATHAN	You're kidding? âsâ Really! I loved the idea of sitting in that big, high chair. 'The ball was good,'Mr McEnroe.'
M	JONATHAN	I can see it. An 80's new wave love song comes on the radio. She beams, reaching across Jonathan to turn it up. a, S 11 I used to love this song. "S" stands up on the bed, starts to dance. She reaches her
M	JONATHAN	Trust me, it's not a pretty sight.
M	"S:,	I'll be the judge of that. He hesitates, then takes her hand, rises to his feet, and is S Il See? You just need the right partner. She closes her eyes, swaying with the music. They dance As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn escapes her. She covers her mouth. of S+â I'm so sorry. Suddenly I'm crashing. She drops down on the bed, tugging him down with her. They

M	JONATHAN	How about tomorrow? /. S to It is tomorrow. She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from to the purse, then back at "S," sleeping peacefully on his He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her on the desk on hotel note paper: Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will call u later. Sunbeam xxx He stares at the note, beaming - when his cell phone rings.
M	MAN'S VOICE (V.0..)	Are you free tonight? A bea- - and then Wyatt's familiar laughter.
M	JONATHAN	Hey! Are you back in town?
M	WYATT (V.0.)	I wish. It's friggin' anarchy in the U.K.. I'm stuck here at least another week.
M	JONATHAN	Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night - at the Hudson.
M	WYATT (V.0.)	The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been enjoying my little gift.
M	JONATHAN	Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl.
M	WYATT (V.0.)	That's fantastic! Who is the lucky gal?
M	JONATHAN	She's a member of your naughty little sex club. I have broken all the rules and had an honest-to-God conversation.
M	WYATT (V.0.)	That's extremely naughty of you! So what happened, Romeo?
M	JONATHAN	I'd like to say it's a long story but it's not. When you are coming back, you gotta meet her.
M	WYATT (V.0.)	So she's, what, a lawyer or something?
M	JONATHAN	I-have no idea, I don't know all that much about her. All I know is I can't wait to see her again.
M	WYATT (V.0.)	Listen, I don't want to dampen your spirits, but - be careful, okay?
M	JONATHAN	What do you mean by that?
M	WYATT (V.0.)	Nothing. I'm just saying, this club - who knows who anybody is, right?
M	JONATHAN	Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just have to go with what you feel, don't you?
M	WYATT (V.0.)	True enough. Hold on a sec. Muffled sounds of Wyatt talking to someone else.
M	WYATT (V.0.)	It's non stop back-to-back bullshit here. Listen, I'll call you later. And hey - congratulations! Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan smiles. And then reads the note again - grinning. sleepy smile lingering on his face. He calls up the list of "Recent Calls: Incoming," scrolls up to the top number. It reads: "Number Unavailable." Jonathan looks worried, wondering how he can get a hold of her - when his cell phone rings. He immediately picks up.
M	JONATHAN	Hello?
M	WOMAN (O.S.)	Are you free tonight? I think you have the wrong number. the stairs, not wanting to descend. Below him he can hear the lonely roar of a train pulling in below. only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his cell phone is ringing. He picks up.
M	JONATHAN	Hello? Intermittent static on the other end. And then what sounds like a WOMAN GASPING; it's unclear if it's a sound of pleasure or pain.
M	JONATHAN	.Hello? The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan debates hanging up - when the gasps halt,--replaced by the faintest whisp__of_ a female voice: "No... No please..." There's no mistaking the tone now it's fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM... - and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the phone in his hand, like he's just witnessed something awful. He quickly checks the display: "Number Unavailable." Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was "S"- - when the phone rings again. He hesitates, then picks up. Are you free tonight? Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice. - when something is wrapped around his eyes. He's startled, if S I'll I bought you a present. She drapes the scarf around his neck. It's all striped,
M	JONATHAN	Sure you don't mean "clashing?" She laughs - then notices how tense he seems.
M	,/Sâ	Are you all right?
M	JONATHAN.	I guess. I got a call-before yours - I'm not sure if it was real, or if it was even meant for me - but there was a woman who sounded like she was being - I don't know, hurt. Maybe worse. "S" seems instantly on edge. Something about this scares her. If SIP You don't know who she was?
M	JONATHAN	It could've been a prank. (notices). Now you're the one who looks scared.
M	..Sâ	No, it's just - it sounds creepy, that's all. She shakes it off, mustering a smile as she takes his arm.
M	âSâ	Come on. "S" walk arm in arm through the packed crowd, like a couple. Jonathan looks like we've never seen him before: a fascination with everything around him, especially her. They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets, including a small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle.
M	Â«S"	He's so cute! What's his name? Duck On Bike. "S" beams like it's the greatest name ever. "Duck On Bike" as it totters across the table, trips over a chopstick and flails on its side. /t S â Oh, poor Duck On Bike! She uprights the toy and it keeps on moving across the table.
M	JONATHAN	You gotta respect him; he just keeps at it. A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in J! $ Ft We'll have this... and this... oh, and let's try one of these. Thank you. The Waiter nods, walks off.
M	JONATHAN	What did you order? â S of I have absolutely no idea.
M	JONATHAN	How do you know we'll like it? How do you know we won't? Jonathan gazes at her a beat.
M	JONATHAN	This is so...not my life. Is that a good thing?
M	JONATHAN	More than you know.
M	O	" smiles. Jonathan looks at her.
M	JONATHAN	Ever since that night on the subway - I haven't stopped thinking about you. She lowers.her eyes.
M	JONATHAN	Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out. She slowly looks up again, touched.
M	âSâ	Are you always so honest?
M	JONATHAN	No. it S., Even so, I'm not sure I believe you. Jonathan's look, 'why not?'
M	"S.â	You're in the sex club! Another anonymous guy looking for anonymous action. I'm not judging you, I'm in. there too, but don't say you've been solemnly holding atorch for me for - how long is it -- wow, one whole month! Jonathan smiles.
M	JONATHAN	Point taken. But I've thought about you a lot. In between the mindless shtupping?
M	JONATHAN	And sometimes during. She laughs. The waiter brings them their drinks.
M	JONATHAN	So how come you got involved in the club? She frowns slightly, thinks. âs . If Wouldn't it be great if you could just meet someone and not have to do the 'work/ family/previous relationships' thing? Isn't who we are right now so much more interesting than where we've come from?
M	JONATHAN	Sure... but that didn't really answer my question. She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly. â S of I know it seems like I'm holding out on you, but I'm not. It's just - I turned thirty this year, and I made this vow to live only in the present. And it's good, you know? And yes, maybe it's because there are things in my past I don't care to think about - but that's the same for everyone, isn't it? He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of this. is S . â I like you. I hope you like me. Can't that be enough? Jonathan smiles, completely disarmed by her. The waiter brings their food and goes.
M	JONATHAN	I wasn't asking for an autobiography, you know. I was just curious. If S. IS A woman I know used to do it. So I decided to give it a try. For various reasons, it suits my present situation.
M	JONATHAN	You mean the intimacy without intricacy.
M	âS . 110	It has its merits. At least I thought it did... until you came along. He beams, gazing at her. Blushing, she starts in on the food.
M	JONATHAN	Oh - no thanks.
M	JIS.11	Don't let the wrapper intimidate you. I buy it at a store nearby. It has ginseng in it, you know, for energy. It's not bad, though it sort of tastes like hairspray. She chews her gum. He watches her; the jaw line, her lips.
M	JONATHAN	Hey, are you all right?
M	"SÂ	I don't want to complicate your life.
M	JONATHAN	Too late. -- I want all the complication you've got. She gazes at him, blinks back her emotions. it Sc, Your glasses. They're fogging up. She reaches out and gently removes his glasses. She wipes the lenses, then peering into his eyes, slowly She absently lowers her hand, lost in the unexpected intensity of the kiss. Embraced, they accidentally step under the sheet of water falling off the awning. Jonathan guides her back beneath the awning's shelter. At S is Maybe you should go...
M	JONATHAN	Maybe you should stay. She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately. Again them - - only "S" leans into him instead, leading him out from under and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's just breathed for the very first time. Rack focus on a hotel down the street, its neon sign reads: "Hotel Lotus." She changes channels. Finds some tennis.
M	JONATHAN	Perfect. They watch together. âs_.. So were you any good?
M	JONATHAN	Yeah. But I didn't want it enough. The guys who make it really need it. I played recently, first time in years. I've got this friend - a new friend, he's great.
M	JONATHAN (CONT'D)	Maybe you'll meet him one day. Anyway, we played and he creamed me. But I knew I was better than him. He said I had no killer instinct. I's. it .I don't know, I think you're a pretty determined character.
M	JONATHAN	On a level with this feller? He points to 'Duck on bike' watching over them like a charm.
M	"S	Given the chance I believe you could be. She idly flips channels, finds a romantic melodrama, an old black and white film. They settle back to watch.
M	JONATHAN	I know we said we wouldn't rush. But for the record, I'm doing everything Ican to apply.the brakes here. âS . of Me too. And for the record, I'd like nothing more than to make love right now. But I'm kind of glad we decided to wait.
M	JONATHAN	It's a wise and mature choice we've made.
M	//S . ,/	Our parents would be proud. Pause. Jonathan is wild with lust for her.
M	JONATHAN	But say we did, just say... Mmhmm...?
M	JONATHAN	Say we were to suddenly tear off these robes... Would that be such a terrible thing? For two people in Manhattan -
M	âS.	In the small hours on a wet Winter's night...
M	JONATHAN	To consummate their deep human needs in a frenzy of...of... Fucking and sucking?
M	JONATHAN	Beautifully put. Its. I. You were saying?
M	JONATHAN	Who - who would blame these two people?
M	0IS â	Who could possibly judge them? They face each other, breathing deeply, almost panting...
M	JONATHAN	And who would know? His face is inches from hers - when she rolls over and She sips her water, as she turns back to Jonathan. Still,
M	JONATHAN	is everything okay? She starts to say something, then stops herself and nods
M	JONATHAN	Where are you going?
M	,I $â	For ice...
M	JONATHAN	Ice, huh?
M	I,S,I	I saw a machine down the hall. I'll be right back. She starts to tie her robe closed -
M	JONATHAN	That's all right, I'll go. He hops off the bed, grabs an ice bucket from the mini bar and a key card from the table, he surreptitiously adjusts his the handle when - Wait -
M	JONATHAN	Yes? She hesitates a cryptic beat - then shakes her head, and smiles at him with immense tenderness. Jonathan beams back. its . P1 Hurry, okay? He blows her a kiss, she blows one back. Almost in SLOW At the ice machine: an eccentric OLD WOMAN in her night Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to break her long nails. Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration. She turns, looks him up and down - he feels a bit self-
M	JONATHAN	Would you like some help, ma'am?
M	OLD WOMAN	I can manage, thank you. Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way. Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in the door, calls out:
M	JONATHAN	I can't get the card to work. He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel: He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence.
M	JONATHAN	Hello?... Hello? He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into the door. Nothing. Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns
M	THE ROOM	He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath splattered all over the crumpled sheets... Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just potatoes.
M	TWO HOURS LATER	THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The ice has melted, a pool of fingers... slowly responding to the cold water... The TV playing a different film now. OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on the floor. He groans a little. Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet, shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of "S." Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator. Jonathan tears off in its direction... He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he
M	THE LOBBY	His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild- sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' "Yesterday." The Asian Clerk working there snaps his head up with a startled gasp. Jonathan barely manages to breathe the word:
M	JONATHAN	help...
M	JONATHAN	.I saw blood on the bed and then someone hit me. When I came to, she was gone.
M	SECURITY 1	This woman you were with. What's her name? Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing.
M	SECURITY 2	Sir?
M	JONATHAN	I don't know. It starts with an 'S'. I think.
M	SECURITY 2	Was shea prostitute?
M	JONATHAN	No! No, she's just a person. A friend.
M	SECURITY 2	A friend with no name.
M	JONATHAN	Of course she has a name! I just don't - we have to find her - something must have happened to her!
M	SECURITY 1	I thought you said there was blood?
M	JONATHAN	I told you, whoever did this must have cleaned it up while I was out. Jonathan freezes, eyes darting to the night stand.
M	JONATHAN	My wallet and keys - they're gone! They were right here... He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies. His
M	SECURITY 2	Maybe she took them.
M	JONATHAN	What?! It happens.
M	JONATHAN	She didn't do this, okay?! Something happened to her! You don't understand, we were... Wait! He sees something on the floor between the bed and night stand. He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper.
M	JONATHAN	This -- this was hers... Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE.
M	SECURITY 1	Sir - are these your clothes? Jonathan nods absently.
M	SECURITY 1	How about putting them on.
M	RUSSO	Mr. Messer, I'm Detective Russo. And you don't know anything about her. Where she works? Where she lives?
M	JONATHAN	I told you how we met.
M	RUSSO	Through a sex group. Her flat words hang in the air. He guiltily avoids her eyes.
M	RUSSO	Does this group have a name?
M	JONATHAN	I don't -- it's not like that.
M	RUSSO	Mr. Messer, I spoke to the desk clerk. She only recalled seeing you check in.
M	JONATHAN	That's... that's the way it works.
M	RUSSO	All right. But now you're telling me that in addition to this mystery woman, there was another individual in the room?
M	JONATHAN	Not at first -- look, I know how it sounds, but I'm telling you, whoever hit me must have - I don't know -- taken her. Maybe even... He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications.
M	RUSSO	Mr. Messer, have you had - experiences like this before? Taking any sort of medication?
M	JONATHAN	I'm not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished back there! There was blood all over the goddamn bed! He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the
M	RUSSO	Yeah. No, I don't think it's necessary... Right. She hangs up and turns to Jonathan. He looks away, barely
M	JONATHAN	What am I supposed to do? An awkward silence, then:
M	RUSSO	If you want to file a report regarding the items she - - the items you claim were stolen... Jonathan shakes his head, crushed and exasperated.
M	JONATHAN	I'd like to go now. Is that all right? Can I just - can I go? something that's caught his eye... HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the exposed area - as if the trophy had recently been moved. Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark -
M	A SPARE BEDROOM	Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts through
M	JONATHAN (INTO PHONE)	.Your ad says 24-Hour Locksmith... Well how soon could you-... Fine. He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs line: "To report a card lost or stolen..." he's looking for: a SMALL BLACK CANNISTER for film. He pops the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money. Jonathan exits the bathroom, crosses the living room to the This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able to come in today. I'm - pretty ill... 'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses.
M	CONDUCTOR (O.S.)	Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next. Jonathan jerks awake. A few stares from nearby passengers. bustling mix of ASIANS and map-clutching TOURISTS. He surveys Jonathan pauses by a STREET VENDOR, takes from his pocket the
M	JONATHAN	I was told you sell this gum here? The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a candy display. In one box is the same gum.
M	JONATHAN	A woman - a white woman - buys this brand of gum. I need to find- The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese.
M	JONATHAN	I'm sorry, I don't -- Do you know the woman I'm talking about? A white woman...? Please, it's very important that I --
M	GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)	My grandmother doesn't speak English. Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL.(13) in a smock.
M	JONATHAN	Can you ask if she knows the name of the white woman who buys this gum? The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes. a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan.
M	GIRL	She says they sell that gum in practically every store in Chinatown.
M	JONATHAN	Hello?
M	DETECTIVE RUSSO	Mr. Messer?
M	RUSSO	The body came in late last night, although time of death's still unclear. She was found in a taxi: driver was in a .coffee shop on his break, came back to his cab and there she was in the back seat. The elevator shudders to a metallic stop.
M	RUSSO	Her purse was recovered from a dumpster about a block away, so we've got a name. Jonathan tenses as the elevator doors BANG OPEN.
M	RUSSO	Simone Forester. Jonathan looks sick with fear. - and eye Jonathan with hard, careful stares.
M	SAME -"'MOMENTS LATER	The M.E. stands over agurney, casually lifts the sheet that's been draped over the body. We glimpse a slender foot. THE VICTIM'S FACE: it's not "S". But we do recognize her. It's the Blonde: the first woman he'd been with, the one he'd She looks the same, only death-pale and naked - and her neck
M	RUSSO	Mr Messer...? He tries to speak, but can hardly breathe, let alone answer.
M	RUSSO	Was this the woman you were with last night? She frowns, suspicious of Jonathan's hesitation. His tense eyes whip across the morgue: the two cops still idling there.
M	RUSSO	Mr. Messer?
M	JONATHAN	No - she's not. Not last night... no. Russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat.
M	RUSSO	I figured it was a long shot. The only reason I called you down is she was last seen with a man in the bar of the Hudson hotel.
M	JONATHAN	The Hudson?
M	RUSSO	You mentioned this group of yours meets up at various hotels. I thought it was worth a shot. Russo glances up at him, trying to read him - something about
M	RUSSO	Mr. Messer, is there anything else you want to tell me? Nervous and torn, Jonathan manages to shake his head.
M	JONATHAN	Wyatt, it's me. I need to talk to you. Call me, OK? Please.
M	RECEPTIONIST	May I help you? Jonathan is standing across from her.
M	JONATHAN	Yes, I need to get in contact with one of your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it's extremely important. He's working out of the London office right now. If I could speak to his assistant or someone who'd know how-to reach him immediately...
M	RECEPTIONIST	Of course. Just a minute. The Receptionist types into her PHONE SYSTEM. She shakes her
M	JONATHAN	B-o-s-e. First name Wyatt.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Wyatt with a 'Y'?
M	JONATHAN	Yes... The. receptionist frowns.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Oh -- Ms. Pomerantz? Angle on a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walking past.
M	RECEPTIONIST	Ms. Pomerantz works in H.R..
M	MS. POMERANTZ	What can I do for you, Mr,
M	JONATHAN	Messer. Jonathan Messer. I'm an auditor from worth and Berman.
M	POMERANTZ	Are you sure you have the right firm?
M	JONATHAN	Yes -- yes, I'm --- He works here. I've seen him working here. I net him here.
M	POMERANTZ	When was this?
M	JONATHAN	A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here. He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion.
M	POMERANTZ	I don't know what's going on, but I can assure you, there is nobody here named-
M	JONATHAN	I've seen him in the halls - for Chrissake we smoked pot in the conference room! Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER - This Lawyer and another laughing at Wyatt's punch line.
M	JONATHAN	Thank God. Look, I'm trying to find Wyatt.
M	LAWYER	Who?
M	JONATHAN	Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him, cracking jokes in the coffee lounge. FLASH ON SAME SCENE: Wyatt looks up, eyes meet Jonathan's.
M	LAWYER	I crack jokes with a lot of people.
M	JONATHAN	Hold on, you're telling me you don't--
M	LAWYER	Hey - easy with the hands, okay? Jonathan realizes he's got the man's sleeve in his fist. He lets go, spins back to Ms. Pomerantz.
M	JONATHAN	He said he was in London with Mr. Rutherford, paperinga - Mister Messer. Jonathan spins to find Ms. Pomerantz scowling at him. A beat.
M	MS. POMERANTZ	Mr. Rutherford is presently recovering from hip surgery. In New Jersey. Jonathan glances around, to find everyone - lawyers, assistants, mail clerks - all staring at him.
M	JONATHAN	Wyatt - .by a MAN in his early 60's, his WIFE behind him; both strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts types.
M	JONATHAN	Sorry, I -- I need to speak to Wyatt.
M	MAN	Excuse me - Wyatt?
M	JONATHAN	Wyatt Bose. He lives here.
F	WOMAN	In this building? He must be new. See, we've been out of town the past2 months -
M	JONATHAN	Not in this building - in this apartment. Young man, we've owned this apartment going on thirty years now.
M	JONATHAN	But... I was right-here-with him... The Man takes a step back, catching his wife's equally wary Wait!! That painting there, it's a Gerhard Richter, right?
F	WOMAN	Yes?
M	JONATHAN	From a gallery! In Munich - the one that Herr Kleiner handles? The art dealer downstairs?
M	MAN	Downstairs? You must mean Mr. Moretti, but he's in the carpet business -
M	JONATHAN	But Wyatt smoke to him.
M	MAN	Unless it was in Italian I doubt he got very far. Jonathan steps back, looking like he's losing his mind.
F	WOMAN	Young man... are you all right?
M	"HERR KLEINER"	Sono spiacente. Jonathan's face there's a sense of loss that is almost overwhelming. Jonathan takes the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper from his pocket, smoothes it in his hands, stares down at it with a look of longing... . when his eyes suddenly widen. He sees something inside, something he hadn't noticed. He unfolds it to reveal two words written in a feminine hand on the white underside: I'm sorry Jonathan quickly looks up, as if expecting someone else to He stares back. down at it, bewildered, stunned - chilled. TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we see something click in his head -
M	RECEPTIONIST	Sir, we asked around, nobody knows the guy
M	JONATHAN	When I was working over here, you made a photocopy of my I.D..'
M	RECEPTIONIST	We do all freelancers, it's policy. Oh - I'm not sure I'm allowed to-
M	JONATHAN	You have to. She looks at him', sees his desperation.
M	SAME - MOMENTS LATER	Jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies, then
M	RECEPTIONIST	That's him? He was real cute. Only he wasn't a lawyer. He was a systems analyst, I think. He was here for a few days to work on the computers. RECEPTIONIST'S POV: of the photocopy in Jonathan's hand. It's
M	RECEPTIONIST	I thought you said his name was Wyatt? PAN TO THE NAME beside the photo: Sansky. WilliamR. Jonathan is already running for the EXIT. engine runs the name: "Bansky, William." A page of some 200+ Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license. We see Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away.
M	ON JONATHAN - MOMENTS LATER	Checking URLs site by site. He finally pauses on one. It's an scans the article, we glimpse some lines of text: "...looking for William Roger Bansky, age 31...was employed on a freelance basis by an on-site software consulting firm in Boston..." -- .Bansky recently relocated from the .a young man on the run..." Tilt up to Jonathan, scribbling on a Post-it pad: He sticks the post-it to the photocopy of Bansky's ID. He steps back, stares at it a beat - when he notices something He frowns at it - clearly out of place here. He picks the file up, opens it... to a series of 8X10 photographs? Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it's of Jonathan standing in the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait. Confused, Jonathan's rapidly breathing as he shuffles through more photos. They're in sequence, taken by telephoto lens. Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator. Opening hands on her neck... He's sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings, startling him. He eyes it warily, then slowly picks up.
M	JONATHAN	Hello? Mr. Messer, it's Detective Russo returning your call. Jonathan freezes, tries not to sound panicked, his eyes fixed
M	JONATHAN	Oh - right, I was just - checking in, to see if you had any leads...
M	RUSSO	On that missing girl of yours? No, not yet.
M	JONATHAN	Oh - okay, thanks- Are you sure you didn't know Simone Forester? The PHOTOS of Simone in his hands, Jonathan tenses...
M	JONATHAN	I told you before - I remember what you said. And you weren't at the Hudson two nights ago?
M	JONATHAN	I don't -- why are you-
M	RUSSO (O.S.)	Turns out among credit card charges made that night, there was one with your name. The card was declined.
M	JONATHAN	I cancelled them all, the day they got stolen. I see. I figured it didn't mean much - cards move quickly. It just struck me, you know.. The coincidence. Jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause.
M	RUSSO (O.S.)	By the way, the morgue confirmed strangulation as cause of death. He found trace fibres of Kevlar in her neck wound.
M	JONATHAN	Kevlar?
M	RUSSO (O.S.)	It's used in certain kinds of rope and string. Jonathan's eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze to Mr. Messer?
M	JONATHAN	Yes - yes, I'm -- Thought I lost you for a second. Well, I won't keep you. You have a good night. Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches for the phone, and dials... another number.
M	JONATHAN	I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I know you're trying to frame me for it, so - so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to God I'll... Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and realizing he's now talking to himself. simply-hang-up. To-erase-and-record-a-new- messa ge---press-Star. Jonathan hesitates, hits the Star key. A new BEEP. Harder:
M	JONATHAN	It's me. I need to talk to you. He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something. Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the trophy raised as a makeshift weapon. He finally halts, uneasy but satisfied there's no one else here - when his home phone rings, startling him. RING...
M	JONATHAN'S ANSWERING MACHINE	This is Jonathan. Please leave a message. BEEEEP. A moment of hiss - then:
M	MALE VOICE (O.S.	Jonathan? Jonathan whips to the phone - it sounds like Wyatt ---
M	PETERSON (O.S.)	Chet Peterson calling - -- only it's not.
M	PETERSON (O.S.)	I understand you were out today. I left messages on your cell but never heard back, so I thought I'd try you at home. He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the
M	PETERSON (O.S.)	Just want to make sure you're up to speed with Weiss Murphy, because the folks at Clute Nichols are expecting you...
M	PETERSON (V.0.)	They're our biggest client, so needless to say, make them your top priority... Jonathan takes out the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper. He stares at it with a look of longing: this is his Priority- the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads. Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a headline: "STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC." The photo is of Simone Forester. every strange face.
M	A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Are you free tonight?... Hello? He hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer We lag back, following him from an ANONYMOUS POV; glance up When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide... It's "S." Jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks; he can't believe he's seeing her again... . when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run.
M	JONATHAN	wait! Wait, right there! Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her. and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him capable of: he jumps onto the tracks! He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails, rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he races for
M	THE CENTER DIVIDER	He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up. He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane - only she's no longer there? He scans the people waiting, no sign of "S" among them - and
M	STOP!	She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing on the center divider, feet soaked in muck. Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other across the solitary track. Then:
M	JONATHAN	I thought you were dead! She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And all at once he's hit with a crushing realization:
M	JONATHAN	You are in on this, aren't you?! She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion -
M	JONATHAN	How do you know him? Damn it answer me! She halts, slowly looks back at him. of camâ Through the club. He caught me trying to steal his wallet. Jonathan looks confused; she's struggling to stay composed but looks like she could break down at any moment.
M	âSâ	He asked if I wanted to make some real money. All I had to do was get involved with you, and not ask any questions. Jonathan just stares, devastated.
M	JONATHAN	So everything between us - was nothing? She fights back tears.
M	., S	No - no... After that first night I tried to call it off, he said he'd kill me if I didn't go through with it.
M	JONATHAN	Go through with what? The plan. Get you out of the hotel room, slip out and meet up later for my money. Only I ran instead. He's been looking for me ever since. I have to leave the city -
M	JONATHAN	Then why didn't you?
M	SÂ	Because I needed to see you again. I needed to be sure you were all right. Despite his conflicting emotions, Jonathan is moved by this. S,f I didn't know how to find you - you were just a number in a cell phone, and Jonathan had taken that. I remembered you took this train -
M	JONATHAN	Wait, Jonathan? I'm Jonathan. Jonathan Messer. You're -? O.S. we hear the approaching roar of an INCOMING TRAIN... ii S 7f Did you go to the police?
M	JONATHAN	I can't. He's framing me for murder. What?
M	JONATHAN	He killed a woman from the club, someone I'd been with. "S" is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no idea. I/ S$f Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you understand? You need to get the hell out of here, he's going to kill you! The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER... Don't you understand? He's going to kill - - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out... and swipes "S" out of Jonathan's view. Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its her through the windows.
M	STOP!	He boards the train; using it as a bridge, he pushes through Shuttle to New York's Grand Central Station. Grand Central is next. He jumps off the train, in the direction she'd been walking -- only she's nowhere in sight. Jonathan spins frantically as glimpse of her - no sign of her in any of the windows... her tearful expression bidding him a heartbreaking goodbye. He stumbles to a devastated halt, eyes pleading vainly as he directly beneath it the train's steel. exterior labelled the shuttle line's circled black and white S.
M	TICKET AGENT	Let's see - there's one to New Haven, leaving in... six minutes. If you need to go farther, you can transfer from there. "S" peers anxiously around her, like someone hunted.
M	#; SIT	And that's the very next train leaving? A man's hand extends a handkerchief from the seat behind her.
M	âSâ	No thank you. RACK FOCUS on the man withdrawing his handkerchief behind
M	WYATT	Suit yourself. RACK BACK TO "S" as her eyes blink open in terror -- He takes out his cell phone, dials. The other end immediately
M	JONATHAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Jonathan Messerâ Jonathan hangs up. Takes an angry breath. Presses redial. He hangs up again. But his face bears a blank, eerily driven Jonathan hangs up and just stares at the phone in his hand, freezes. RING... RING... RING... RING... RING -- a CLICK of
M	JONATHAN	Hello...? Not a word from the other end. We barely make out BREATHING.
M	JONATHAN	Wyatt? Is that you? Jonathan takes a tentative step forward, as if fearful that the least movement will cost him this connection.
M	JONATHAN	Say something damn it! From the receiver we hear a well-exhaled breath. And then:
M	WYATT'S VOICE (O.S.)	Yesterday... Reeling, Jonathan grips the phone tighter to his ear.
M	WYATT'S VOICE (O.S.)	All my troubles seemed so far away...
M	JONATHAN	What do you want from me? Now it seems as though -
M	JONATHAN	Answer me! - they're here to stay, Oh I believe
M	JONATHAN	Why are you doing this to me?!
M	WYATT'S VOICE (O.S.)	- in yester--
M	JONATHAN	I'm going to find you, you hear me? I'm- CLICK. Dead air.
M	JONATHAN	Hello?... Hello?! Jonathan SLAMS the phone down, tension in his face joined by
M	JONATHAN	I'm going to find you.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE	Mr. Messer? Jonathan is too lost in thought to hear it.
M	WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Jonathan. He glances up... to find Russo standing near the entryway -
M	RUSSO	I was gonna call, but I was in the area. Just doing some follow-up. Jonathan tries to mask his uneasiness.
M	JONATHAN	Follow-up?
M	RUSSO	On that missing girl of yours. The.one whose name began with. an "S." Have any luck finding her? Jonathan absently tightens his grasp on his briefcase.
M	JONATHAN	No. No luck.
M	RUSSO	I see. That's too bad. she studies him a cryptic beat, then smiles flatly.
M	RUSSO	Well, who knows, maybe she'll turn up yet. You have a good day, Mr. Messer. Jonathan nods tensely, then walks off, feeling her watching him from the curb as he goes. Close on Jonathan as he scribbles on a post-it: "Yesterday - Beatles?" Widen to find the post-its organized with his usual fastidiousness - only scribbled with words, not numbers: "Wyatt Bose = William Bansky" and other random scribblings. He's trying to apply his mathematical mind to his crisis, hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all. Reverse angle through the glass: to anyone passing, he looks like your typical overly meticulous, isolated auditor. Closer on Jonathan as he clutches the table, looks seconds away from utterly losing it -- when something suddenly occurs His cell phone. He grabs it. Presses a key repeatedly -
M	JONATHAN	Are you free tonight?
M	JONATHAN	Do you know Wyatt Bose?
M	BLUE PASHMINA	Excuse me?
M	JONATHAN	What about William Bansky? Does that name-- She darts.for the "Door Open" button, but he blocks her path.
M	BLUE PASHMINA	I swear to God I'll scream.
M	JONATHAN	Please, I'm not trying to scare you, I just -- I'm looking for someone.and it's very important that I find him. she tries to push past him, again Jonathan blocks her.
M	JONATHAN	He does this too - or he did. someone had to give him the numbers. Someone let him in. If I can-'find who it was that knew him, they might know where he's -- she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel. Jonathan grasps his leg - she presses the button and is out the opening doors before he's even looked up. SOUND ADVANCE: TENSE CLACKING of computer keys... about-faces without a word. Jonathan has a relentless look in faces and the hotel backgrounds behind them change.
M	JONATHAN	I need to ask you something, it's incredibly important... He pauses to unfold his now scotch-taped photocopy, shows it to her. She freezes, eyes fixed on the license photo. Jonathan braces himself for her departure - when she stares back up at him in scared but clear recognition.
M	SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER	Seated on the edge of the made bed, Black Business Suit shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette.
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	I was in Chicago on business, a little over a year ago. I was out.to dinner with one of our Chicago partners,.a man named Holloway. That's how I met him. TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we SMASH TO:
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT (V.0.)	At first I assumed he was a junior executive at their firm. But he wasn't. That's not to say he didn't work for Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate capacity... Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette.
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing - you know, this thing -- for a while.
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT (V.0.)	I was simply curious. More so when he apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten about another engagement. Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance...
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	I was intrigued. He was intelligent, informed about everything from law to art to politics. I'd never met anyone so in command of his own charm. He said that he'd come from nothing, that everything he learned, he learned from his tricks. He claimed that Holloway was even grooming him for a position at his company. She lights another cigarette with her old one.
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	In a way, I felt for him. But I also admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a way of making me feel - close to him, you know? This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods.
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	So I found myself telling him things.. Personal things. And, next thing I knew -
M	JONATHAN	You told him. About this. A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette.
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know all the details. I suppose I'd had too much to drink. And I was distracted... I was thinking about what a great lay he was going to be. nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes. Exhausted, her body goes limp. TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	Only afterwards I discovered two of my credit cards were missing. As was my cell phone. Of course I couldn't say anything to Holloway. And Jamie must have known I'd never report it to the police. So I just put the incident out of my mind. I all but forgot about it, until one night, maybe two months ago -
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT (V.0.)	I almost didn't recognize him. But when I did, I suddenly felt very, very scared. She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	I left before he saw me. She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space.
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	He must have used my cell phone to get into the group. Anyway, that's it. That's all I know. She looks around. At the room, the bed. She shudders, rises.
M	JONATHAN	Wait - thank you. Have you ever run into him again?
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	Getz? No. And I don't ever want to.
M	JONATHAN	Getz?
M	BLACK BUSINESS SUIT	That was his name. Jamie Getz.
F	SOLANGE	Jonathan, you're home early - Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt.
F	SOLANGE	Oh - je suis desole. My mistake. Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps. who's James Getz?
M	WYATT (V.0.)	A guy I roomed with freshman year at Princeton. on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton University alumni. He types in: Getz, James. A beat - then: "No match." A long list of G names follows. Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz.
M	JONATHAN	Shit. Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed. Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name. "Sort no contact information available." Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types: An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: "BODY OF photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his name: "Reed Holloway." Jonathan glances up at the Hotel employee manning the desk.
M	JONATHAN	Can I print this out? reading over the printed article. joined by the distant.wail of SIRENS. Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses. He wrinkles his nose, smelling something. He looks up: two blocks away, a his building! Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked gear and peels out in a fast turn. Jonathan spins - something continues racing toward his building... The neon "FLEURS DE SOLANGE" sign crackles and sparks in the flame. Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers emit what must be an awful stench. Two EMS WORKERS are loading a gurney on which Solange lays, She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible:
F	SOLANGE	Jonathan... He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance.
M	JONATHAN'	Is she going to be okay?
M	EMS WORKER	Yeah, she'll make it. The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand grabs Jonathan's arm.
M	JONATHAN	I live here. His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its
M	FIRE WORKER	Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat. Better get your valuables together.
M	JONATHAN	How did it start?
M	FIRE WORKER (O.S.)	We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse.
M	FIRE WORKER (O.S.)	Mr. Messer? Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the doorway. He quickly shuts the file.
M	JONATHAN	Just - give me a minute.
M	FIRE WORKER	That everything? Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation.
M	JONATHAN	I guess it is.
M	FIRE WORKER	You got someone you can stay with?
M	NIGHT CLERK	It's fifty for the night. Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what he discovers are his last three $20s. Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway with bleached hair styled in a loose spike -- IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17." Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand.
M	OFFICE ON PHONE	Boston Police, how can I direct your call? Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him:
M	JONATHAN	This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge number 274655. 1 just need some information from you guys. Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally -
M	OFFICER ON PHONE	Well?
M	JONATHAN	You've got a case, a missing person named William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can tell me the date he was last seen?
M	OFFICER ON PHONE	Hold a sec. Bansky, William, last seen... May 17. Jonathan's eyes return to the Holloway article ("BODY OF
M	OFFICER ON PHONE	Anything else you-
M	JONATHAN	That's it, thanks. Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by the connection he's made. TILT DOWN to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: "BOSE = BANSKY = HOLLOWAY." To this he adds: "= JAMES GETZ" all anxious tension.
M	TELLER	M'kay, if you'll just swipe your ATM card. She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan's right.
M	JONATHAN	Actually, my card was stolen.
M	TELLER	Mmm'kay... do you see those two taupe colored telephones over there? Just pick up either one and you'll be connected with our automated system.
M	JONATHAN	The thing is, I already used your automated system and...look, this passport's all I have left, it's the only thing proves who I am and now I'm down to like my last ten dollars here, so... Jonathan's cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow.
M	TELLER	Mm'kay, if you press "0" on either phone? A customer service representative will -
M	JONATHAN	Give me a goddamn break.
M	TELLER	Sir, there's no need for profanity.
M	JONATHAN	Oh no? In the last few days I've seen a woman I thought might be dead turn up alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn up dead, both at the hands of a guy about whom everything I know is apparently a lie. I've had my building set on fire, my neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment ransacked. So please forgive my language, but it's been one fuck of a week. The stunned Teller stares back at him slack-jawed.
M	JONATHAN	Look, I know I'm just another face on this side of the glass, I get that. But I'm begging you, as one human being to another, please let me into your life just long enough to help me out here. Please. The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods. She starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up.
M	TELLER	I'm showing that card as having been sent out four days ago. It definitely went out. We even heeded the change of address request.
M	JONATHAN	Well, like I -- wait, what request?
M	TELLER	Apparently you informed the bank of an address change? She swivels her monitor so he can see.
M	TELLER	Mr. Jonathan Messer, 140 E. 91st Street - under the mat. Sure enough, there's a key.
M	THE BEDROOM	A room as empty as the others - with the exception of a small slowly nears...to find it's a stack of mail. He picks up an Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him. He steps out of the room to investigate. We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat... .until Jonathan finally steps back in, only slightly at ease. He returns to the stack of mail, picks up an envelope. He reads: "Mr. Jonathan Messer 140 E. 91 St..." Eyes wide, he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail - all addressed to him at this address. Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when he finds at the bottom of the stack: another PHOTOGRAPH. It's of track from Jonathan. And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with fear, unaware of a blurred, nearing intruder...
M	WYATT	Long time no see. Jonathan spins round, Wyatt's standing there with a gun. It's pointing directly at Jonathan.
M	WYATT	I have some instructions. Follow them and I might let her live.
M	JONATHAN	Where is she?
M	WYATT	This should've been simpler. I frame you, you panic...
M	JONATHAN	Where is she?! A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts:
M	JONATHAN	Goddamn it tell me what you did to--
M	WYATT	Press pause on the questions and listen. The brokerage firm you're auditing is Clute Nichols. As a standard part of that audit you're temporarily privy to all client accounts as well as access codes required for transactions. At 11 p.m. tonight you're going to skim from those accounts a total of $200 million and transfer that money to an account I've established overseas.
M	JONATHAN	I can't - I have no idea how to even-
M	WYATT	I know you don't. But I do. Your passport. Now, please. Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches it.
M	WYATT	It's all in there. 11 pm tonight. Their banks will just be opening.
M	JONATHAN	It won't work - they screen for stuff like this. It'll be discovered eventually.
M	WYATT	I can live with eventually. I always have.
M	JONATHAN	This account overseas - it's in my name, isn't it? A moment of tense silence. Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then:
M	JONATHAN	Why'd you pick me? Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question.
M	WYATT	You answered the ad, Jonathan. "Feeling all alone out there? Have a great job, fine personality and good looks to match, but no time to.meet that special someone? Help is just a phone call away -"
M	JONATHAN	The ad - in Money magazine... Told you to block that Caller ID. Of course I had to scope out a whole lot of losers before I hit the jackpot. After all, there only so many Jonathan Messers out there. If you screw with me, well - you saw what I did to that Blonde? That's kindness compared to what I'll do to your little .girlfriend. You won't even recognize her when I'm through.
M	JONATHAN	Why should I believe you? Everything you told me was lies.
M	WYATT	Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now... now you're fucked. He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door.
M	WYATT	Remember: be smart. I'll be watching you. And... feel free to take a shower, looks like you could do with one. The front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring shell-shocked at the envelope. As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to instant before the car would have hit him. Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers
M	ASSISTANT	Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers is here to see you. Jonathan Messer? Really? Well - okay, bring him back. We follow the assistant out the door, read the name stencilled on the glass "CHET PETERSON, SENIOR MANAGER." lobby. The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is
M	PETERSON	Jonathan, good to see you again! - reverse angle to find a YOUNG MAN we've never seen before.
M	YOUNG MAN	Actually, I was just looking for Fred Whipple's office? Next door down. The Young Man ducks out, and now Peterson sees his Assistant glasses. Peterson reloads his greeting:
M	PETERSON	Jonathan, good to see you again!
M	PETERSON	Well, I have to say, your resignation comes as something of a surprise. Most of our auditors seem to like the freedom the position affords. You'll stay on to finish up at Clute Nichols, of course? Track around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from him, Wyatt," wearing one of Jonathan's suits, hair colored and styled like Jonathan's, even sporting identical eyeglasses. He offers an awkward half-smile, just as Jonathan would.
M	WYATT	Absolutely.
M	PETERSON	So do you have any plans?
M	WYATT	Yes. I'm going to travel. I want to see the world. Peterson nods benignly. lettered-boxed by the glass wall through which he watches employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers. Throughout this, Jonathan's blank stare of harrowed tension never changes. its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed. Jonathan peers at the laptop clock. It reads 10:58 PM. Jonathan presses F2. Reads some more, types some more. Finally we read: ENTER SUB-ACCOUNT NUMBER. Jonathan enters more per Wyatt's typed instructions. Reads. Jonathan copies the numbers in from the instructions. Waits. glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil. Jonathan stares at the cursor.on the laptop screen, the icon blinking petulantly. He's about to type... And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE, TIGHTER ON JONATHAN. His eyes fixed on the cell phone, an idea forming in his mind -- RING!! of the cell phone suddenly jars us. RING... Jonathan What's taking you? Jonathan says nothing. We can hear Wyatt getting tenser: I said what's taking you?
M	JONATHAN	I wondered if you were monitoring this. Don't worry about what I'm doing. Just finish the transaction. Now.
M	JONATHAN	Not until I see her. The transfer's impossible without an access code. And there's no way I'm entering it until I'm sure that she's safe. So you tell me. How do we do that? Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent. We tighten on Jonathan, holding his breath, any plan he's concocting clearly hinging on this...
M	WYATT (0..S.)	You have a wireless connection? Jonathan lets out a brief exhalation.
M	SAME - MOMENTS LATER	Jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut, packs it in his gym bag, in which we glimpse the photo he's kept with him of "S" smiling up at him. He then turns to his cell phone once more. He picks it up,
M	AWOMAN'S VOICE (FROM PHONE)	Hello? Are you free tonight? A sudden, jarring SOUND ADVANCE OF MUSIC as we noise unspeakably loud. We travel through the din, past hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy.
M	WYATT (O.S.)'	May I ask you a personal question? Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic smile. With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers. Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand.
M	JONATHAN	Where is she?
M	WYATT	In one of the rooms. Safe. I got us a table.
M	WAITRESS	Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy. The Waitress leaves. Wyatt raises his glass.
M	WYATT	To friendship. Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt.
M	JONATHAN	Bansky's dead, isn't he?
M	WYATT	He was dead when I met him. Just like you. The rest was a mere formality. Of course he didn't have your bargaining chip. Speaking of which...
M	JONATHAN	Not until I see her. She's the only reason I'm here and not at the police.
M	WYATT	I told you, she's in a room. Alive.
M	JONATHAN	Give me the key then. Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on the key card to indicate a room number.
M	WYATT	As soon as you're done, I'll tell you the room number.
M	JONATHAN	Not good enough. Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a handgun concealed by his suit.
M	JONATHAN	You won't let her live. You killed all the others, you'll have to kill us too.
M	WYATT	Hey, I like you, okay? You'll be fine.
M	JONATHAN	You like me.
M	WYATT	I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all, you're my creation. I'm the one who gave you life.
M	JONATHAN	Don't you get it? It was her, not you! She's the one. She gave me life! You can steal my identity, but not what's here. He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is startled by Jonathan's passionate outburst.
M	WYATT	Yeah, well, I'm weeping big wet ones for you both. Now, let's get on with it. I don't have all night, Jonathan. Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent. Wyatt lets go of the key card. Jonathan opens his bag... CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep. The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an access code. Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then pauses, looking confused. Jonathan quickly reaches around. to the back of his laptop,
M	WYATT	What is it?
M	JONATHAN	My wireless modem - I must have left it in the conference room. I can't get back online. Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething.
M	WYATT	You stupid fuck.
M	JONATHAN	I can go back there and-
M	WYATT	No. Get up.
M	JONATHAN	They don't let you use your own computer. Wyatt takes out a hundred dollar bill, gives it to Jonathan.
M	WYATT	They will now. Jonathan takes the hundred, and heads into
M	EMPLOYEE	You forgot your. own room number?
M	JONATHAN	I just checked in and it's been a hectic day. Look at me! The Employee looks uneasy - something about the ill-concealed tension in Jonathan's eyes.
M	EMPLOYEE	You could just ask at the front desk. I'm sure they can-
M	JONATHAN	I really don't have time, okay? Jonathan presses the bill into the Employee's palm, peers up Still eyeing Jonathan. He sees the Employee hesitate, then accept the money. Wyatt looks relieved -- when his view is abruptly blocked by the Auburn-Haired Woman.
M	AUBURN HAIR	Pardon me, but may I ask you something - personal? Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused.
M	AUBURN HAIR	Are you waiting for me?
M	BACK TO JONATHAN IN BUSINESS CENTER	The Employee finishes swiping his card through a scanner.
M	EMPLOYEE	Room 907.
M	JONATHAN	907 - thanks. His view of Jonathan still obscured by Auburn Hair.
M	WYATT	What the hell are you -- And then he sees Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise portrait, then at her cell phone's clock -- and now realizes:
M	WYATT	Motherfucker! He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair aside - eyes darting to the just his laptop resting on the counter where he'd been standing. close - - when his eyes land on something in the hallway: the fire alarm. He suddenly reaches out to stop the elevator door just as it's about to close. the elevators for the nearest stairs.
M	SECURITY (O.S.)	We've got alarms on two - wait, three floors - Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past in sporadic fits - 925...921... 918... 913... 910... Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907. He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot -- - a CLEANING WOMAN. She says something.in Vietnamese, indicating the ringing alarms.
M	JONATHAN	Fire, I know - I'll be out in a minute. The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan quickly slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green. Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she? He searches every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere. The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set -- eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the TV was resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan taps it, he realizes: it's hollow. He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall... And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: "S". hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by how lifeless she appears - - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say face to his chest.
M	âS.,	You're alive. He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his
M	JONATHAN	What do you say we stick together from now on?
M	JA S"	I'd like that. Close on Wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests - - when he halts, peering up through the railings' lozenge- shaped opening, past a collection of hands and profiles... TIGHT ON WYATT. As yet unnoticed by Jonathan, he remains halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him. TIGHTER ON HIS EYES. That predatory gleam. EVEN TIGHTER ON HIS GUN, tucked carefully at his side. CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" three stories above, starting to descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the flow of bodies below. Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a good look. He grips the railing, leans further over... and his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him --
M	JONATHAN	He's down there! I saw him -
M	11 SIP	Oh God -
M	JONATHAN	Up - we've got to go up! Clutching her arm, Jonathan and "S" turn back up, against the evacuating. ANGLE ON WYATT as he presses upward, his steely gaze even more rapacious. The crowd is thinning as Jonathan and "S" race upward as well. INSERT JONATHAN'S POV: a shaky, dizzying blur as they race higher and higher... INSERT WYATT'S POV: from below but gaining on them, Jonathan of the staircase... CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S", desperately racing upwards... CLOSE ON WYATT bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the staircase now empty and quiet, save for the footfall of Jonathan and "S" - no more than three floors above Wyatt now... Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the railing, takes aim... CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" still hurrying up - when a shot rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the bullet missing them by inches. "S" screams, Jonathan tugs her with him - - when a second shot rings out, the bullet punching a dent into the underside of the stairs just overhead. ON WYATT, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the yet told them of the alarms. CLOSE ON A STAIRWELL DOOR MARKED "EMERGENCY EXIT" as it suddenly bangs open and Jonathan and "S" spill out. They pause a moment - thrown by the sight of all the wealthy, beautiful faces, laughing, dancing.
M	JONATHAN	Come on! She grabs his hand, and they waste no time disappearing into They keep moving. Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous - though not as smartly attired. BACK TO THE STAIRWELL DOOR as Wyatt enters the party, scanning the dense crowd, all senses alert. INSERT WYATT'S POV: just a mass of successful, attractive, partying young men and women. There's no way to pick Jonathan and "S" out. Wyatt's smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the periphery. WITHIN THE CROWD "S" clutches Jonathan's hand, their heads ducked low as they press forward... CLOSE ON WYATT, frustration gnashing at him as he quickens sweat beading on his face -- -- when suddenly the music stops. Wyatt frowns., eyes darting. Ladies and Gentlemen, we need everyone to evacuate the hotel. This way please. The crowd noise resumes, as the throngs begrudgingly start for the exits. ON JONATHAN AND "S," doing their best to stay concealed within the exiting crowd. Angle on Wyatt pushing his way through the crush, shoving people aside, trying to find them - - when he suddenly stops. He has an idea. He takes out his cell phone. BACK TO JONATHAN AND "5" within the crowd - - when Jonathan's cell phone RINGS. CLOSE ON JONATHAN as his eyes widen in panic. RING... He quickly fumbles for it, tries to turn it off - lining through the packed suits. WIDE SHOT OF THE ROOFTOP as the throngs are clearing out. Jonathan grabs "S" as they duck, racing across the dark, rooftop, looking for a place to hide. They take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge - She reaches. down for it, starts to lift it - - when Wyatt's hand darts in and grasps the other end. She looks up in terror - when Wyatt punches her violently, knocking her to the ground. Jonathan rushes to her - only to be blocked by Wyatt, gripping the iron rod tight.
M	WYATT	Nice try back there, Jonathan. Looks like you picked up a thing or two from me. Jonathan tries to strike him - when with a lightning quick Jonathan across the face.
M	WYATT	Killer instinct, pall Jonathan crumples, his glasses knocked to the ground. CLOSE ON WYATT as he grips the iron rod like a tennis racquet, steps into position - - and brings the rod down on Jonathan with ruthless tennis strokes: Backhand! Bam! Forehand! Bam! Slice! Bam! Jonathan can barely peer up, bloody and beaten. He hears Wyatt drop the iron rod... swoops in on us - as Wyatt grabs Jonathan by the throat, hefts him up and to struggle free - when Wyatt jams the gun under his chin. Jonathan freezes. They'll... catch... you...
M	WYATT	Me? No - no, I'm just a face in the crowd. I'm a tourist, just passing through. JONATHAN'S POV: Wyatt's face presses closer, now almost in
M	WYATT	As for you, you had your fun... Wyatt presses closer, crushing Jonathan's back to the edge.
M	WYATT	Now we're going to go back down... INSERT JONATHAN'S HAND reaching into Wyatt's pocket, his
M	WYATT	We're going to get that laptop... CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S FINGERS blindly prodding - he has the phone now - his fingers feel for the antenna...
M	WYATT	And we're going to finish this, once and for - - when with all his strength Jonathan jams the cell phone up Wyatt's grasp slips from Jonathan's collar as he stumbles back, cupping a hand to his wound as he swings his gun toward Jonathan - - when with every ounce of strength Jonathan charges, Wyatt's shot missing him as Jonathan slams him into the ledge wall, seizing the momentum to turn himself - - as Wyatt falls right over the edge of the hotel rooftop... blocking our view of the body they're all gawking at. We travel through the confusion until we find JONATHAN AND "S" sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb, each propped against the other. The 'shock of it all is beginning to fade. He reaches into his
M	JONATHAN	Yours, I believe.
M	01S.11	Thanks, Frank. She winds the toy up. They watch it make it's funny way down the sidewalk.
M	JONATHAN	Can I ask you something personal? She nods.
M	JONATHAN	What's your name? "S" considers the request, then smiles gently, leans in close and whispers the answer in his ear. Jonathan gazes at her a moment - whatever her name is, it must be perfect.
M	JONATHAN	So what now? She smiles up at him.
M	S	Well... are you free tonight? On Jonathan: treasuring these moments. He is truly free -- perhaps for the first time in his life.
M	JONATHAN	Yes. I'm free. They gaze at each other. We leave Jonathan and "S" to their privacy, pulling back as
