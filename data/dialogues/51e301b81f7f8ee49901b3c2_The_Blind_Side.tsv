CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	There's a moment of orderly silence before a football play begins. Players are in position, linemen are frozen, and anything's possible. Then, like a traffic accident, stuff begins to randomly collide. From the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the Redskins quarterback, takes the snap and hands off to his running back. JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Two Mississippi. It's a trick play, a flea flicker, and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback. HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Three Mississippi. Up to now the play's been defined by what the quarterback sees. It's about to be defined by what he doesn't. LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player in the NFL and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie. The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	He will also change the game of football as we know it. WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES.
FRANK GIFFORD (V.0.)	Again, we'll look at it with the reverse angle one more time. And I suggest if your stomach is weak you just don't watch.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	Joe Theissman never played another down of football.
LEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE	Now, y'all would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an NFL team is the quarterback. The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	And you'd be right. What you probably don't know is that more often than not the second highest paid player is, thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle. The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)	Because, as every housewife knows, the first check you write is for the mortgage and the second is for the insurance. The left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side.
4 SERIES OF SHOTS 4	"Famous" left tackles - Jonathan Ogden, Orlando Pace, Andre
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	The ideal left tackle is big, but a lot of people are big. He is wide in the butt and massive in the thighs. He has long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	This is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that Monday night game and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that day he not only altered Joe Theismann's life, but mine as well. As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS --
INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.O.)	Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here? Mr. Oher?... Do you know, do you understand why I'm here?
MICHAEL (V.0.)	To... investigate.
INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.0.)	Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate your odd... predicament.
GRANGER	Do you find it odd? Your predicament? Michael?...
MICHAEL	Iono [I don't know]... Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him
MICHAEL (CONT'D)	Can I... can I leave now? No. You can't. Michael sits in the back seat, behind STEVEN HAMILTON, 14, Not a word is spoken as they drive through the streets of Michael's face tells us he's never seen anything like this.
BIG TONY	They say you the coach. Cotton eyes Tony, offers a hand.
BIG TONY	Tony Hamilton, but everybody call me Big Tony.
COTTON	What can I do for you, Tony?
STEVEN	Sure is pretty, huh, Big Mike? Mike doesn't answer, just takes it all in. Steven sees and
STEVEN (CONT'D)	Not even locked!
MICHAEL	White people are crazy.
BIG TONY	You see I promised my mama Boo, on her deathbed, that I would get Steven outta public and into a church school.
COTTON	I appreciate that but I'm not involved with admissions.
BIG TONY	I figured I'd come to you; seeing as you might need some players.
COTTON	What sport does he play?
BIG TONY	Anything with a ball. Good, too. He has Cotton's attention for a moment, then it passes...
COTTON	Classes start in a week. It'd have to be for next semester.
BIG TONY	I know what you're thinking, Coach, but I got money. I'm a mechanic at Wilson's Auto t'other side of town. What if someone drops out or moves? Could they get in then?
COTTON	"They?" You only mentioned one son.
BIG TONY	Steven, yessir, but I brought another boy along.
COTTON	Another boy?
BIG TONY	Yeah, Big Mike. He stays on our couch sometimes. It's a bad deal. His mama's on the crack pipe and he ain't got nobody. He just wanted to come along with us today.
COTTON	Would... Big Mike be an applicant as well?
BIG TONY	Yeah, sure, why not. Cotton sighs, considers what to do.
COTTON	They'd have to fill out applications and make an appointment for interviews.
BIG TONY	I was hopin' you might just interview 'em now.
COTTON	They're here? Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven
BIG TONY	The little ones Steven and the big
COTTON	Big Mike.
BIG TONY	Yeah. That's right. Cotton's lips are almost quivering --
COTTON	Mother of God...
COTTON	Are there spots available or not? PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before...
SANDSTROM	Technically, yes, in both grades. But we have a greater responsibility than just filling classrooms. Steven Hamilton's paperwork looks acceptable and I believe he would be capable of succeeding here but the other kid -- Sandstrom looks through papers for the name.
COTTON	Big Mike.
SANDSTROM	Michael Oher gives us no reason to believe, based on his record, that he would be successful here.
COTTON	How bad could it be? Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file,
MRS. SMITH	We're not sure exactly how old he is due to lack of records. He has a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th percentile. He's been enrolled in seven different institutions, including a gap of eighteen months around the age of ten when he apparently didn't attend school at all. He repeated first grade as well as second, there's no record of attendance in third, and in fourth grade --
COTTON	So they moved him ahead without going to third grade. That says something. His attendance records are abysmal and his grade point average begins with a zero. Zero-point-six- Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and
MRS. BOSWELL	Everyone passed him along - gave him D's so they could hand their problem off to the next school.
COTTON	Brave kid. For wanting to come here. For wanting a quality education. An education denied him by the poor quality of the schools he's attended. Most kids with his background wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place.
MRS. SMITH	Coach Cotton, we understand your interest in the young man's athletic abilities.
SANDSTROM	He wouldn't be able to play until he got his grades up anyway.
COTTON	Forget sports! Look at the wall. He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: "NEIGHBORLY,
COTTON (CONT'D)	Christian. We either take that seriously or we paint over it. You don't admit Michael Oher for sports, you admit him because it's the right thing to do. Their faces announce that he's made a point. Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a
MRS. BOSWELL	Class, this is Mike Oher and he's new here so I expect you all to make him feel welcome. Mike, take any empty seat. She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)	This is a quiz based on the information you learned last year in your science curriculum. Don't worry. It won't be graded. I just want to see how much of the information we need to hit again. The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet
MRS. BOSWELL	It's okay.
MICHAEL	Can I leave now? She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S)	Why he gotta always stay here?
BIG TONY'S VOICE (0.S)	Ain't got nowhere else. And how's that your problem? You the Red Cross all of a sudden? Michael tries to shut his eyes.
STEVEN	Hey, Big Mike, um... my Pops' girlfriend... she don't really want you to stay with us no more. Big Tony's Taurus pulls into the lot.
STEVEN (CONT'D)	We can still give you rides if you want?
MICHAEL	Naw, it's aright. Steven gets in the Taurus. Michael watches it drive away.
LEIGH ANNE	I don't care if Patrick Ramsey did approve the chair. He's an NFL quarterback not Martha frickin' Stewart. She arrives at the concession stand and waits impatiently.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	There's a difference between Bunny Williams and Lazee-boy. Three large popcorns and two large diets. he'll be showing off his home theatre but all I'm gonna see is a brown Barca-lounger. I'm his designer, my name's on it. Deliver what I ordered!!! She hangs up angry, spots a friend nearby and her frown turns
LEIGH ANNE (CONT`D)	Hi, sweetie! We're on the Kidspace committee together, aren't we?! It'll be a hoot!
SEAN	S.J., you know that kid?
SJ	What kid?
SEAN	Black kid. Up in the corner.
SI	Be goes to high school here. His name is Big something... Big Mike. Sean eyes Michael suspiciously.
SEAN	He look like a volleyball fan to you? Leigh Anne, loaded up with refreshments, makes her way up the
LEIGH ANNE	What'd I miss?
SEAN	Collins got a dig.
SI	It's girl's volleyball, Mom. You didn't miss anything. Leigh Anne gives him a look then stands and shouts --
LEIGH ANNE	Collins! Move your feet! ON THE COURT - COLLINS TUOHY, a beautiful 16-year-old, sighs
LEIGH ANNE	Collins, we'll wait outside. And don't double condition in the shower - you still have homework!
COLLINS	I'm going over to Cannon's house to study.
SI	Can I go.to the Johnson's for dinner? They invited me.
LEIGH ANNE	What's so awful about our house? Sean smiles, shakes his head as SJ and Collins leave. Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael, Sean considers this for a second before leaving.
FIRST TEACHER (BOB)	Well, the big guy's been here a month and he ain't cutting it in my class.
SECOND TEACHER (APRIL)	Why would Admissions do this? It's not fair to us or the boy.
THIRD TEACHER (GLENDA)	Just setting him up to fail.
BOB	I don't think he has any idea what I'm teaching.
GLENDA	And how would you know if he did? He won't even talk. Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself.
MRS. BOSWELL	He writes.
APRIL	His name. Barely. Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page.
MRS. BOSWELL	He threw this in the trash can. "I look and I see white everywhere: white walls, white floors, and a lot of white people. The teachers do not know I have no idea of anything they are talking about. I do not want to listen to anyone, especially the teachers.
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)	They are giving homework and expecting me to do the problems on my own. I have never done homework in my life. I go to the bathroom, look in the mirror and say, "This is not Michael Oher." He entitled it "White Walls." The room is dead quiet.
BOB	How's the spelling? Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves.
COTTON	If he makes his grades he'll be eligible in the spring.
SEAN	If he makes his grades.
COTTON	But boy-hidey, just look at him. Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something
SEAN	What did you eat for lunch today?
MICHAEL	Here in the cafeteria.
SEAN	I didn't ask where you ate, I asked what you ate.
MICHAEL	A few things.
SEAN	Do you need some money? For lunch?
MICHAEL	I don't need any. Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton.
SEAN	Buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill. He's hungry.
COTTON	You could tell that by looking at him? I didn't grow up all that different from him. At public school they when food is finite, you'd be surprised how much time you can spend thinking about it..
MRS. BOSWELL	You'll have one hour. If you finish early put it on my desk and sit quietly. She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT`D)	Mike, come with me.
MRS. BOSWELL	You can take the test back here away from everybody else. I'll sit
in there so if there's anything you	don't understand you can ask. Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)	Mike, how about I ask the questions and you tell me the answers or as much as you know. She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads:
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)	Protozoans are classified based on: a) how they get their food, b) how they reproduce, c) how they move, or d) both a and c. Michael just stares. After a long moment
MICHAEL	Iono...
MRS. BOSWELL	Just try. Ask questions if you don't understand. But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face He lifts his eyes to her and points to -- -- the question on the test - specifically to the word
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)	"Classified". It means how things are grouped together.
MICHAEL	Like our "class"? Exactly. This science course is classified based on what grade y'all are in. Eleventh. Michael nods understanding.
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)	Okay, Mike, you ready to answer the question? He looks at her.
MRS. BOSWELL	He knows it!
BOB	Who knows it and what does he know?
MRS. BOSWELL	The material. Michael Oher. I gave him this test verbally. She holds up the test -- marked with a large red "C".
APRIL	On how big a curve?
MRS. BOSWELL	He's been listening the whole time. It's amazing what he's absorbed. And, trust me, he's listening to you, too. Okay, so his reading level is low and he has no idea how to learn in a classroom, but... I'm not saying he's going to pass but Big Mike is not stupid.
MICHAEL	They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this
SI (OS)	Smile at 'em. Michael turns to see Si nearby, watching him. It lets them know you're their friend. Did you know that even little kids born blind smile? They've never seen anyone do it before but they smile anyway. So it's universal. That's why it works. Not that you should fake it or anything... You're Big Mike, right? Sean holds. out a fist for Mike to "knock" and the two walk
SJ (CONT'D)	I'm Sean, but everyone calls me Si -- that's for Sean Junior because my father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy. He was a basketball star at Ole Miss, point guard, and now he owns like a million Taco Bells. Leigh Anne's car pulls up to the pick up/drop off and Si
SJ (CONT'D)	Manana'. Michael smiles at the kid, who smiles back.
LEIGH ANNE	Who's that SJ?
SI	Big Mike.
LEIGH ANNE	Get your feet off my dash. Big Mike?... Michael turns to see Paul Sandstrom, the principal.
SANDSTROM	Mike, I just got a call from someone at the police department. Do you remember the story in the papers awhile back about the man who fell off an overpass? No one knew who he was and they're not sure if he jumped, or if... at any rate he passed away. Sandstrom struggles with how to say the words.
SANDSTROM (CONT'D)	Mike, the man... was your father. Michael takes this in. without showing emotion.
SANDSTROM (CONT'D)	They've been looking for someone to notify and came across your name on our registry. I'm really sorry, son. Were you close? When did you last see him?
MICHAEL	Iono.
SANDSTROM	I'll try and find out where he's buried. Maybe we could go visit? Michael nods, then rises and walks away. A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she
LEIGH ANNE	Turn on the heat!
SEAN	I don't know where it is.
LEIGH ANNE	It's fifteen degrees, you've had this car a month and you don't know how to turn on the heat?! What would you do without.me?
SEAN	Lots of things you'll never know about. They trade a look and a smile. Sean puts a.hand on her lap.
SI	Get a room.
LEIGH ANNE	Si, don't let this go to your head but I thought you were very convincing in the role of... uh...
SI	Indian Number Three. I tried out for the Chief but they gave it to Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I think there was some multi-cultural bias thing working.
SEAN	Or maybe they just thought he'd make a better Chief.
SI	Dad, he's like Chinese.
LEIGH ANNE	And you're Irish. If you weren't the Chief how come you got the headdress? Si hesitates a bit before --
SI	Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of those free Quesadilla tickets. And where does the acorn fall?
SEAN	Don't laugh too hard. The Quesadilla saved our ass.
LEIGH ANNE	What is he wearing? It's below freezing. What's his name again?
SEAN AND SJ	Big Mike.
LEIGH ANNE	Where's he going? She gives Sean a look. Sean rolls down his window.
SEAN	Hey, Big Mike! Michael stops in the crosswalk, looks to the car.
SEAN (CONT'D)	Where you headin'?
MICHAEL	Gym.._. Sean nods, rolls his window back up and drives as the light
LEIGH ANNE	The gym? It's nine o'clock. No answer to this. They drive another half block,before --
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Turn around. Sean sighs, knowing better than to argue.
LEIGH ANNE	Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate. You said you're going to the gym? Michael slowly nods. The school gym's closed. Michael takes this in but doesn't respond.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Why were you going to the gym? Big Mike?! Why were you going to the gym?
MICHAEL	Because... it's warm. This hits her all at once. She bites her lip.
LEIGH ANNE	Do you have anywhere to stay tonight? Michael eyes the ground, then nods.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Don't you dare lie to me.
SEAN	I've seen that look many times. She's about to get her way. Leigh Anne makes her way back to the car, with Michael in
SEAN (CONT'D)	Where we going?
LEIGH ANNE	Home.
COLLINS	How'd the dork do in the play? She turns to see... Sean, Leigh Anne, SJ in headdress and Um... okay...
LEIGH ANNE	I'd give you the guest bedroom but it's full of sample boxes. And the sectional in the family room slides apart when you sleep on it. At least that's what Sean says.
MICHAEL	Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch?
LEIGH ANNE	Only when he's bad. There's a powder room right there and we're upstairs if you need us. The two share a look, then...
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Sleep tight, honey. She leaves. Michael is dumbfounded, stares at everything in
SJ	Psst... SJ is in the doorway to the kitchen.
SJ (CONT'D)	If you can't sleep, my room is the first one at the top of the back stairs. I got X-Box, Madden, everything. Michael nods then smiles. SJ smiles back, gives a thumbs up NORMAN ROCKWELL. On the cover is "FREEDOM FROM WANT" -
LEIGH ANNE	Was this a bad idea?
SEAN	What?
LEIGH ANNE	Don't lie there and pretend you're not thinking the same thing as me.
SEAN	Fine, tell me what you're thinking so I can know what's supposed to be on my mind.
LEIGH ANNE	How well do you know Big Mike?
SEAN	In case you haven't noticed he doesn't have much to say. What's the big deal? It's just one night. It is just one night, right?.. Leigh Anne?...
LEIGH ANNE	Do you think he'll steal anything?
SEAN	I guess we'll know in. the morning. He rolls over to go to sleep. Leigh Anne just sits, stares.
LEIGH ANNE	If you hear a scream call the insurance adjustor.
LEIGH ANNE	Up and at 'em. Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes.
LEIGH ANNE	Sean Junior! She opens the shades.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Clean this place up before you come downstairs. You hear me? Si crawls out of bed and Leigh Anne exits the room and starts The couch is totally back to normal and the sheets, blankets
LEIGH ANNE	Mike? Big Mike?! Nothing. She hears a DOG BARKING in the neighborhood and
LEIGH ANNE	Big Mike! He stops, turns. Leigh Anne walks over.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Where are you going?
MICHAEL	Iono.
LEIGH ANNE	Are you spending Thanksgiving with your family? Michael shakes his head.
LEIGH ANNE	Come and get it! Sean sits at the TV,"watching an Ole Miss football game,
SEAN	SJ, Ole Miss is about to score!
SI	Which means they're about to fumble. They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food.
SEAN	Looks great, hon. Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned.
COLLINS	I see a lot of starch. SJ jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce - Michael stares - he's never seen so much food. Leigh Anne
LEIGH ANNE	As much as you want. Oh, the potato salad! With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and
SI	Why are we eating in here? Leigh Anne holds out her hands.
LEIGH ANNE	Shall we say grace? The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands. Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Heavenly Father. We thank you for all your many blessings on this family. We thank you for bringing us a new friend. And we ask that you look after. us in this holiday season and never let us forget just how very fortunate we are. Amen. A chorus of Amens and they all dig in. Michael is unsure at
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Big Mike, do you like to shop? Because tomorrow I think I'm gonna have to show you how it's done.
MICHAEL	I qot clothes.
LEIGH ANNE	You "have" clothes.. And an extra T- shirt in a plastic bag does not a wardrobe make. He looks out the window.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Okay, fine, let's go get 'em. Just tell me where I'm going. No answer. Frustrated, she pulls the car over to the curb Tell me everything I need to know about you. He still stares out the window.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Who takes care of you? A mother? Do you have a mother? A grandmother maybe? Nothing. Leigh Anne turns off the car.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Look, Big Mike, we can do this the easy way - or we can do it the hard way. Take your pick. He eyes the floor.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Fine. Tell me one thing I should know about you. One thing! After a beat...
MICHAEL	I don't like to be called Big Mike. She wasn't expecting this, nods her head.
LEIGH ANNE	Okay. Mike or Michael? Tell you what, from now on, to me, 'you're Michael. So,... Michael, where we headed?
LEIGH ANNE	This is where your mother lives? He nods and she opens her door.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Okay, let's go. He forcefully reaches across her and closes the door,
MICHAEL	Don't get out!
LEIGH ANNE	Who's going to help you with your clothes? Don't get out of the car. Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices
ALTON	Big Mike! Where you been?! Michael ignores, keeps walking. And who's that fine piece o' thing driving you around? One of Alton's minions, DAVID, sits nearby. Michael sees
MICHAEL	Hey, David. David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back.
MICHAEL	She wadn't home.
LEIGH ANNE	We can come back. Michael takes this in, looks out the window.
MICHAEL	She prolly moved to a nicer place.
LEIGH ANNE	I've lived in Memphis my whole life and never been anywhere near here. You're going to take care of me, right?
MICHAEL	I got your back.
LEIGH ANNE	That's good to know. Thank you. As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes
SALESMAN	Everything I got to fit him will be -right here.
LEIGH ANNE	This is it? If this is all you got why's it say "Big and Tall" on the sign?
SALESMAN	Big and Tall. You need "Bigger and Taller". He walks away. She starts to pore through the small rack.
LEIGH ANNE	Anything you like? The one thing I know about shopping is that if you don't absolutely love it in the store, you won't wear it. The store is where you like it best. And before you choose something think about yourself wearing it and ask yourself: Is this me? This isn't atrocious.
SHE	He shakes his head again. After a beat he points. This one? This is the one you like? He nods, completely sure.
LEIGH ANNE	Have a great day. Learn something! They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Don't get your panties in a wad.
BETH	The best part about Paris was the food.
BETH (CONT'D)	They use sauce like we use gravy. I had to join a gym the day'we got back.
LEIGH ANNE	Any of y'all spent much time on the other side of town?
ELAINE	On the freeway.
SHERRY	Where exactly are you talking about?
LEIGH ANNE	Alabama Street... Hurt Village.
BETH	Hurt Village -- that sounds like a threat.
LEIGH ANNE	You're not far off.
SHERRY	It would "hurt" me to go there.
ELAINE	It would certainly hurt your reputation to go there.
BETH	I'm actually from there but didn't mind hard work and look where I am now.
LEIGH ANNE	Eating an eighteen dollar salad.
BETH	And it's a little soggy to be honest.
SHERRY	Such a shame.
BETH	Yes it is.
SHERRY	Civil rights was responsible for some good things but those programs - building ugly, low cost housing. I mean how could you be creative if you lived there? It's stifling.
ELAINE	Did you know that black men were employed at a higher rate before those programs? It's a fact.
BETH	They're not "black", Elaine. The term du jour is African-American.
ELAINE	And what if they're from Jamaica, or like Bermuda.
SHERRY	Then they're BerMUDian-Americans. They all cringe and laugh.
ELAINE	So, why are you asking about the projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one of your charities?
BETH	A project for the projects. That's catchy. Money would raise itself. Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh Anne. And they laugh harder. Leigh Anne smiles, biting her lip.
SI	It can't be that hard.
MICHAEL	Oh, yeah?... Si looks at the Michael's notebook.
SI	There are different parts of a sentence and you just have to draw lines showing what they do. Sean stops by the refrigerator for a cold drink while he They're gonna get rid of those stores in Florida... I'll look it over now but I need the sales figures by tomorrow morning.
SJ	Dad, you remember how to diagram sentences?
SEAN	Nah. Sean starts to leave, then stops at the door, turns around,
SEAN (CONT'D)	Let's see...
MICHAEL	You don't have to help. I mean if you're busy or somethin'.
SEAN	I know. Think of a sentence like a football team. This is a noun here, see? That's like the team name or what they're known for - whether they're a running team or a passing team. And this is the verb. That's what makes 'em go - like a star player -- maybe a quarterback, maybe a running back. And this is an adjective - everybody oohs and ahs over adjectives but they're not as important as verbs.
SI	They're like wide receivers.
SEAN	Or kickers. Michael just stares at them. You have no idea what we're talking about, do you?
MICHAEL	Not exactly. They all laugh.
NEARBY	Leigh Anne watches, fixated on the image of the three. Sean
LEIGH ANNE	Do you want to stay here, Michael? He keeps working. Because if you want to... stay... for awhile... longer... I'll try and find some time to figure out a bedroom for you. He stops, turns to her. She walks over, examines the
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	I mean, look at this, you've practically ruined a.ten thousand dollar couch. She moves closer to him. Her face softens.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Do you want to stay here, Michael?
MICHAEL	I don't want to go anyplace else. She's a bit befuddled by the response.
LEIGH ANNE	Well,... alright then.
LEIGH ANNE	I see here on the admission that we're Michael's contact for medical emergencies? Mrs. Smith (from the admissions meeting) sits with her.
MRS. SMITH	Sean wrote that in last week. We needed a contact number and the ones listed weren't in service.
LEIGH ANNE	Love that man. Leigh Anne pulls out another sheet, hands it over...
LEIGH ANNE (CONT`D)	What's this?
MRS. SMITH	The state makes schools measure for career aptitude in eighth grade. It came with his'file.
LEIGH ANNE	They try to figure out what a kid's going to be in the eighth grade? What does. it say about Michael? Mrs. Smith nods and reads over Michael's results.
MRS. SMITH	Doesn't look promising. Spatial relations - third percentile.. Ability to learn - fifth percentile. It's funny though. He tested in the 98th percentile in one category.
LEIGH ANNE	Which one?
MRS. SMITH	"Protective instincts." Leigh Anne smiles and hands the file back.
MRS. SMITH (CONT'D)	It's just so sad. Leigh Anne considers this, then...
LEIGH ANNE	Yes, it is sad. So sad. But he either doesn't know it or doesn't think so and it's my job, and your job, to make sure he doesn't find out. Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for himself and I'll be damned if he starts to because of the way we treat him. "Darned." Leigh Anne and Michael stand in the doorway.
LEIGH ANNE	I had to put half my samples in storage but well, anyway, back there's a desk. Chest o'drawers. Night stand. Lamps. Alarm clock. Bed. Sean says a lot of pro athletes use futons if they can't find a big enough bed. Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Well, try it out. See if it feels okay. He gingerly moves to the bed; touches it.
MICHAEL	It's mine?
LEIGH ANNE	Yeah. What?
MICHAEL	Never had one before. A room to yourself?
MICHAEL	A bed. We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying
LEIGH ANNE	Well, you got one now.
OUTSIDE THE DOOR	Michael stands, unsure what to do.
MRS. BOSWELL	Define Osmosis, Michael.
MICHAEL	I think I know that. It's when water...
GLENDA	Name the combatants in the battle of Waterloo.
MICHAEL	I know that. The little guy, Napoleon was on one side and...
MICHAEL	What?
SJ	Enough with the rugby shirts. You look like a giant bumble bee. Collins walks by with friends and glances but ignores them.
GIRL STUDENT	Who's the big guy hanging around with your little brother?
COLLINS	Just another one of Mom's projects.
GIRL STUDENT	That must get incredibly old. Collins' look says, "yes it does."
SI	That Taco Bell. The KFC catty corner. The Long John Silvers on the next block.
MICHAEL	You own all of 'ern?
SJ	Yeah. We've got hundreds. A hundred and fifteen.
MICHAEL	Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't have to go to work?
SEAN	Hey, hey now. I'm working even when I'm not working.
MICHAEL	And y'all eat at those places for free?
SI	All you want. It's awesome.
MICHAEL	What do y'all do with the leftover food? At the restaurant?,
SEAN	Well, we have to throw some of it away. What's already been cooked.
MICHAEL	That's too bad.
SEAN	Yeah, I'd rather sell it.
SI	Seems like you could give it away or something? You should check into that, Daddy. Leigh Anne and Sean share a look and a smile.
SEAN	All right, I will.
MICHAEL	Why ain't we eatin' at one of yours tonight?
SEAN	.Because tonight is a special occasion.
SJ	What?
SEAN	I talked to Coach Cotton today. Michael's grades improved enough that he can do spring'training for football in March.
LEIGH ANNE	Isn't that great?
SI	Oh, man, you are gonna crush some people! Michael almost smiles, a little unsure.
LEIGH ANNE	I've got a design book I need to get. Sean, go check on our reservation.
SEAN	They'll seat us when we walk in the door. You can get the book after dinner.
LEIGH ANNE	They might be closed by then.
COLLINS	I need some new magazines. SJ shrugs and joins the girls, as does Michael. Sean watches
LEIGH ANNE	Come on, your dad's already PO'ed. Collins holds up a book. Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.
COLLINS	Remember this one, Mom? You read it to us like a thousand times. She softens, walks over, takes the book.
LEIGH ANNE	"And he gnashed his terrible teeth and roared his terrible roar.-
SI	I always liked this one. He holds up THE STORY OF FERDINAND.
LEIGH ANNE	Yeah, me too. Leigh Anne sees Michael left out, but interested.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Michael, your Mama ever read either one of those to you? He just stares at her, the answer obvious.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	No one ever...
SEAN	Now that was a good steak.
COLLINS	Thanks, Daddy.
MICHAEL	Thanks.
SEAN	You're welcome. As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke. Michael?... Leigh Anne touches Sean's arm, silencing him. They watch as -- Leigh Ann is amazed. She's never seen affection in Michael.
LEIGH ANNE	Who was that boy you were talking to, Michael? At the restaurant.
MICHAEL	Marcus.
LEIGH ANNE	He works there?
MICHAEL	Yeah.
LEIGH ANNE	And how do you know Marcus?
MICHAEL	He's my brother. Complete silence in the car. Leigh Anne finally breaks it --
LEIGH ANNE	Well, I'd like to meet him someday. Would that be okay with you?
MICHAEL	I don't know where he stays.
LEIGH ANNE	When's the last time you saw him, Michael?
MICHAEL	When I was little mebbe.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	"Once upon a time in Spain, there was a little bull --"
LEIGH ANNE	"...and his name was Ferdinand. All the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. He liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers"...
SEAN	What?
LEIGH ANNE	Huh?
SEAN	Why are you smiling?
LEIGH ANNE	I don't know. I'm just happy. Really happy.
SEAN	Does. this happiness have anything to do with Michael?
LEIGH ANNE	No. It has everything to do with Michael. Sean smiles, kisses her, turns off the light. She snuggles
SEAN	Oh... He gets the message, rolls over and kisses her on the lips.
SEAN (CONT'D)	Happy's good. As their amorous activities continue...
LEIGH ANNE	I think we should start a charity. For kids like him.
SEAN	Sure, okay.
LEIGH ANNE	Maybe fund a program at Wingate.
SEAN	Absolutely...
LEIGH ANNE	Are you even listening to me?
SEAN	I try to concentrate on one thing at a time.
LEIGH ANNE	You knew I was a multi-tasker when you married me. She kisses him and they roll over, laughing.
PHOTOGRAPHER	Okay, big smiles everyone! FLASH! Leigh Anne smiles but notices ---
LEIGH ANNE	Michael! Come over here and get in the next one. Sean gives her a look like she's crazy.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	We don't have a single picture with him. Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna put it on the Christmas card. Michael moves in behind the family, dwarfing them.
PHOTOGRAPHER	Okay, really big smiles. One, two, three... say Rebels!
LEIGH ANNE	Who's winning?
SI	Tennessee.
LEIGH ANNE	Too bad. Who are they playing?
SEAN	So you root against Tennessee no matter who they're playing?
LEIGH ANNE	Yep. With gusto. She can't stand Tennessee.
LEIGH ANNE	Collie-bell, I thought you were going to your boyfriend's?
COLLINS	I'm just gonna hang around here today.
LEIGH ANNE	I like that.
SEAN	Coupla messages on the machine. She pushes PLAY on the message machine.
MESSAGE MACHINE	Hey, Leigh Anne, it's Patrick Ramsey.
PATRICK RAMSEY	You sent me these measurements for clothes and I posted 'em in the locker room for donations but there's a problem.
PATRICK RAMSEY (CONT'D)	I mean, are you sure the sizes are right, because there's nobody on our team who's that big? Gimme a call.
MESSAGE MACHINE	Hey, Sean, hey Leigh Anne, it's cousin Bobby. Happy New Years!
COUSIN BOBBY	Listen, I've had about five cold ones so'I'm just gonna go ahead and ask... Who's the colored boy in y'all's,Christmas Card?
ELAINE (V.0.)	Leigh Anne, you looked teeny-tiny next to him.
ELAINE	It was like you were Jessica Lange and he was King Kong.
SHERRY	I taped your card to, the fridge. The next morning Frank almost gagged on his orange juice.
BETH	Does Michael get the family discount at Taco Bell? Because if he does Sean's gonna lose a few stores. More laughter.
LEIGH ANNE	Look, he's a great kid.
ELAINE	I say just make it official and adopt him. Big laughs at the "crazy" idea.
LEIGH ANNE	He'll be eighteen in a few months. So, I mean it wouldn't make much sense to legally adopt him, right? They realize she's thought about it and stop laughing. After
SHERRY	Is this some kind of white guilt thing, Leigh Anne? I mean charity's the Lord's work but...
ELAINE	What will your daddy say?
LEIGH ANNE	Before or after he turns over in his grave? Daddy's gone five years now, Elaine, and to make matters worse you were at the funeral. You wore Chanel with that awful black hat. Before Elaine can attack -- Look, here's the deal. I don't need any of y'all to approve of my choices. But I do ask you to respect them. You have no idea what this boy's been through.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	And if this is going to be a running diatribe I can find an overpriced salad a lot closer to home.
SHERRY	I'm so sorry, Leigh Anne. We didn't intend to --
ELAINE	No, we didn't, really --
BETH	I mean, what you're doing is so great. To open your home to him. You're changing his life. Leigh Anne smiles to herself, realizing...
LEIGH ANNE	No. He's changing mine.
ELAINE	That's awesome for you, but... what about Collins?
LEIGH ANNE	What about Collins?
ELAINE	Aren't you worried, even just a little? I mean he is a boy, a large, black boy, sleeping under the same roof. Leigh Anne stares at them, shakes her head then grabs the
LEIGH ANNE	I've got this. Shame on you. And strides away.
LEIGH ANNE	Be honest with me now, okay? Collins nods, having no idea what her mother is about to say.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Is Michael being here weird for you?
COLLINS	They're stupid kids, who cares what they say.
LEIGH ANNE	What kids?
COLLINS	At school. They're juvenile.
LEIGH ANNE	And what do the juvenile kids say?
COLLINS	It's really not worth repeating. And don't worry about SJ - he loves the attention. He introduces Michael as his big brother.
LEIGH ANNE	What about you?
COLLINS	It's fine. I mean, you can't just throw him out on the street.
LEIGH ANNE	I can make other arrangements. Just let me know. Okay?... Leigh Anne kisses Collins goodnight.
FIRST LITTLE GIRL	Hi Mike.
MICHAEL	Hi. Need a push? They giggle and Michael pushes them, one arm each until
NEARBY	Collins watches.
FRIEND	Where are you going? Collins walks away toward Michael.
FRIEND (CONT'D)	Collins? They are aghast when they see Collins set down her books
AT MICHAEL'S TABLE	Michael is confused. She looks at him and shakes her head.
COLLINS	Quit looking at me like that. I mean, we study together at home. Eyes in the library are on the pair as they start to read. Michael carries four blocking dummies to the center of the
COTTON	You know how much those things weigh? This kid's gonna make us all famous.
SEAN	Easy, Bert. It's only the spring and he hasn't even been through his first practice.
COTTON	Okay, Mike, you fought off the block but you've got to shuck him and make the tackle. You got it?
NEXT PLAY	Michael gets down in a his stance and when the ball is
COTTON (CONT'D)	Shuck the blocker, Mike! Michael gingerly sets the lineman on the ground.
IN THE STANDS	Leigh Anne shows up, sits next to Sean.
LEIGH ANNE	How's he doing?
SEAN	Doesn't quite have the hang of it yet. Michael tries to crawl under the blocker.
COTTON	No! Michael drops back and tries to intercept a pass.
COTTON (CONT'D)	No! Michael holds a blocker off him with one arm and looks
COTTON (CONT'D)	No! No! No!
COTTON	Most kids from bad situations can't wait to be violent and that comes out on the field. But this kid, he doesn't seem to wanna hit anyone.
LEIGH ANNE	He's Ferdinand the Bull.
COTTON	What?
LEIGH ANNE	Nothing.
COTTON	I thought for sure he was gonna be a player. I can't believe I used up my chits to get him in school.
LEIGH ANNE	I thought you said it was your Christian duty? He gives her a smirk. Look, Bert, he's never even played before.
COTTON	And he won't in the fall if he doesn't improve a lot before then.
SI	This is your summer workout sheet. First it says to warm up and get loose. Well, go ahead, get loose. Michael moves his arms around a bit then stops.
SJ (CONT'D)	You loose? Okay, next is five one hundred yard runs to stretch out your legs. Michael grimaces.
MICHAEL	Let's go home, play some video games. Look, everybody at. Wingate is expecting you to be a star football player. You don't want to let them down, do you?
MICHAEL	Iono..
SI	What about Dad and Mom? 'Cause you see, in our family, everyone's an athlete. Dad was a basketball star, Collins plays volleyball and runs track. Me, as you know, I do it all and Mom,... well, Mom was a cheerleader, which doesn't exactly count but don't tell her I said that.
MICHAEL	Okay... Michael moves to the line. Si raises his whistle and blows. SJ holds a blocking dummy and Michael fires out, hitting Michael does ten yard "back and forths" as Si times him. WIDE - SJ runs Michael through his workout. He blows his
MICHAEL	Mrs. Tuohy? Michael stands nearby.
LEIGH ANNE	I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my shoulder for my mother--in-law. Call me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost anything else.
MICHAEL	Will you help get me something?
LEIGH ANNE	What?
MICHAEL	Driver's license.
LEIGH ANNE	Why do you need a driver's license when you don't have a car?
MICHAEL	You have a car.
LEIGH ANNE	That I use to haul y'all all over creation with. He doesn't say anything but doesn't leave either. Leigh Anne
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Why do you want a license, Michael?
MICHAEL	Something to carry. With my name on it. She locks eyes with him. This time he holds her gaze.
DMV EMPLOYEE (V.0.)	Address?...
DMV EMPLOYEE	Is this his address as well?
LEIGH ANNE	Yes. He lives with us.
DMV EMPLOYEE	Are y'all his foster parents?
LEIGH ANNE	No.
DMV EMPLOYEE	His legal guardians?
LEIGH ANNE	oh... no. The Employee does a search on the computer. As she types...
DMV EMPLOYEE	Does he have a Social Security card? Leigh Anne looks to Michael, who shakes his head.
DMV EMPLOYEE (CONT'D)	Birth certificate?
LEIGH ANNE	We tried to find one for school, but... You don't know which city, which county, which hospital?...
LEIGH ANNE	How big a problem is this? DMV Employee looks to Leigh Anne.
DMV EMPLOYEE	There's nobody named Michael Oher in the system. Another last name perhaps? Leigh Anne again turns to Michael, who shrugs.
LEIGH ANNE	Look, I'll sign something saying he lives with us and we'll pay for the insurance; whatever it takes. What's it gonna take? Off the Employee's look -- You wanna do what?!
LEIGH ANNE	Don't pretend you didn't hear me.
SEAN	Shouldn't we at least talk about it?
LEIGH ANNE	What do you think we're doing? And don't act like I'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as his medical contact at school.
SEAN	There's a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone. Someone we barely know.
LEIGH ANNE	And that's another thing. We have to find out more about his past.
SEAN	He won't talk about it. He's like an onion; you have to peel it a layer at a time.
LEIGH ANNE	Not if you use a knife. What if we sent him to a child psychologist?
SEAN	Do you really expect Big Mike --
SEAN	-- expect Michael to lie down and talk about his childhood like he's Woody Allen or something? Michael's gift is his ability to forget. He's mad at no one and doesn't really care what happened in the past. This puts her on her heels.
LEIGH'ANNE	You're right.
SEAN	Excuse me? "You're right?" How'd those words taste coming out of your mouth?
LEIGH ANNE	Like vinegar. She moves to him, holds him. At least promise me you'll think about it.
SEAN	Alright.
LEIGH ANNE	"Alright" you'll think about it or "alright" we should do it?
SEAN	Is there a difference? Just tell Rodney to hold the chiffonier for me and I'll get by after while.
TO	She hangs up and, exasperated by the wait, rises and walks
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	I'm not cutting, just asking. I've been waiting for over an hour and I look around and all I see is people shooting the bull and drinking coffee. Who runs this place anyway? The "heard it all" EMPLOYEE points to the wall with a
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Well I'd have it in shape in two days, I can tell you that.
EMPLOYEE	I'm sure you would. How can I help you? She turns to the man waiting behind her.
LEIGH ANNE	He was first.
MAN IN LINE	No, you go ahead. I think I. want to hear this.
EMPLOYEE	Me, too. I do not appreciate the attitude.
EMPLOYEE	Ma'am, you can tell me what you want or I'll make sure you wait all day. How. Can. I. Help. You?
LEIGH ANNE	I'd like to become a legal guardian.
EMPLOYEE	Lord look over that child.
RONALD	There's very little on Michael. Most of his files have been lost.
LEIGH ANNE	What is in there?
RONALD	A few case notes. This one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed Michael and six half-siblings from Denise Oher's care when Michael was seven. Quite a scene evidently. They had to split up the kids. And it's far from the worst.
LEIGH ANNE	Where is she? His mother?
RONALD	Dunno, but if you find her we have a bunch more files we could add to.
LEIGH ANNE	How many children does she have?
RONALD	At least a dozen, probably more. With her drug arrest record my guess would be she can't even remember. Leigh Anne absorbs this.
LEIGH ANNE	We'd need her permission though, .right?
RONALD	No. Michael is a ward of the state. Just apply and get a Judge to sign off on it.
LEIGH ANNE	So you would give him away without even telling his mother? Ronald shrugs. Leigh Anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted. She
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Who you lookin' for?! Startled, Leigh Anne turns and sees Alton approaching...
LEIGH ANNE	I'm looking for Denise Oher.
ALTON	Dee Dee don't stay there no more.
LEIGH ANNE	Do you know where she might be?
ALTON	Chances are she ain't gone far. I seen you before. You with Big Mike now. You wanna come in for a wine cooler or sumthin'?
LEIGH ANNE	No, I can't, but thank you.
LEIGH ANNE	Hi. Mrs. Oher?
DENISE OHER	You from the state?
LEIGH ANNE	No. My. name is Leigh Anne Tuohy and your son Michael lives with me. And my family. Denise takes this in.
DENISE OHER (O.S.)	How is my boy, how's Big Mike? He's fine. He's doing well. When did you move from the other building? Denise emerges from the back of the apartment, adjusting a
DENISE OHER	Awhile back. This is temporary. Friends let me stay here.
LEIGH ANNE	When did you last see Michael?
DENISE OHER	Iono. We might have some wine in the kitchen, if...
LEIGH ANNE	No, no that's very kind but...
DENISE OHER	How many foster kids you got living with you?
LEIGH ANNE	Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael. We were just helping him out.
DENISE OHER	State don't pay you nothing?
LEIGH ANNE	No.
DENISE OHER	And he lives with you? And you feed him?. Buy him clothes, too?
LEIGH ANNE	When I can find them in his size.
DENISE OHER	You a fine Christian lady.
LEIGH ANNE	I try to be.
DENISE OHER	This is all real nice what you're doing, but don't be surprised if one day you wake up and he gone.
LEIGH ANNE	What do you mean?
DENISE OHER	He's a "runner". That's what the state called him after they took him from me. Every foster home they sent him to, he'd slip out the window at night and come looking for me. No matter where I was that boy would come find me, take care of me. I've had some . health problems.
LEIGH ANNE	Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a different name? Denise tries to remember. After a few seconds...
DENISE OHER	Proctor. That was his Daddy's last name.
LEIGH ANNE	Where is he, the father, if you don't mind me asking?
DENISE OHER	Ain't. seen him since he left.
LEIGH ANNE	And when was that?
DENISE OHER	Week after Mike was born.
LEIGH ANNE	Do you have Michael's birth certificate? Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head. And
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	It's okay, Mrs. Oher.. I'll figure it out. Leigh Anne walks over, kneels and takes Denise's hands. You'll always be Michael's Mama. Would you like to see him?
DENISE OHER	No... Not this way.
LEIGH ANNE	People lose birth certificates. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
DENISE OHER	It's Williams. His last name's Williams. Couldn't even remember who the boy's father is. Leigh Anne bites her lip'and puts her arms around Denise, who
SEAN	Michael, we have something to ask you.
MICHAEL	What?
SEAN	Leigh. Anne and I would like to become your legal guardians.
MICHAEL	What's that mean?
LEIGH ANNE	Well, what it means is, we want to know if you'd like to be a part of this family? Michael looks to a grinning SJ, to Collins who nods and
MICHAEL	I kinda thought I already was. Leigh Anne feels a wave of emotion, nods to him, then races Michael looks to Sean for an explanation. Sean shrugs
SEAN	Is that the one you wanted? He just stands there, staring. Sean hands him the keys.
SEAN (CONT'D)	Well, hell, take it for a spin. Go on.
SI	Can I go, too?
LEIGH ANNE	okay, but Michael?... Be careful. Michael smiles and he and SJ get inside the truck.
COLLINS	He wanted a truck?!
SEAN	Michael thinks he's a redneck.
MICHAEL	Tenth grade tough?
STEVEN	Naw. This really yours?
MICHAEL	Yeah.
STEVEN	They just give it to ya'?
MICHAEL	Yeah. After a beat...
STEVEN	You're right. white people are crazy. And they walk off together to class.
BOB	You are now seniors. Congratulations. But with that distinction comes responsibility. This will be one of your tougher courses because my job is to prepare you, at least most of you, for the rigors of college Freshman English. You are each holding a class study guide which details assignments. I won't remind you what is due and when. Read the materials and come prepared. At the end of the year you will each choose one of our literature assignments and present a written dissection of the piece. The faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course.
SI	See, you're the ketchup, here at Left Tackle. On the weakside.
MICHAEL	I'm not that weak, SJ.
SI	it just means there are more blockers on the other side. It's a compliment, really.
MICHAEL	A compliment for a condiment. Good one. So the first play is simple. "Gap." It just means you block whoever is in front of you, or the person on your inside shoulder if you're not covered by a defender. I'll be the running back and you show me what you're supposed to do. Ready... . Hike! SJ, using both hands, moves Cayenne pepper back a bit, then
SJ (CONT'D)	Open lane to the end zone. All there is to it. Si slides Cinnamon forward. The bottle flies off the end of
LEIGH ANNE	What is going on here?!
MICHAEL	Cinnamon just scored.
SI	We're going through the playbook. Michael got moved to offense..
LEIGH ANNE	Well, when you're finished, put the players back in the spice cabinet.
SJ	No problem. Actually, Mom, we were waiting for you. The new Madden came out and me and Michael want to go get it.
LEIGH ANNE	Honey, I've got a meeting in ten minutes.
MICHAEL	I'll drive.
SI	Look for Walker Street. That's where we take a left. Si finds a hip-hop station and they both groove to the beat, That's what I'm talkin' 'bout! As the beat reaches a crescendo -- Michael instinctively throws a big arm in front of SJ as --
LEIGH ANNE	This is not a twenty thousand dollar Oushak, Jerry. The borders are different widths, it's been altered. Leigh Anne's phone rings. As she answers
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	We'll give you nine tops. Hello ... The look on her face changes -- As she approaches she sees -- Michael's truck -- the front end
LEIGH ANNE	Michael! He looks up, sobbing.
MICHAEL	I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!
LEIGH ANNE	Where's SJ?! Go help him! Please go help him! Leigh Anne turns to see a group of PARAMEDICS kneeling around
SI	Mom, do you think the blood will come out of my shirt?
FIREMAN	An airbag deploys at 200 miles per hour. Your son's too small to sit in the front seat.
LEIGH ANNE	He's okay, though, right?
FIREMAN	Busted lip, some facial bruising.
When an airbag strikes a child his	size it usually means a fractured face, a broken neck or worse. It's almost like the airbag started at him then changed direction. Defective or something. Very, very lucky. Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the
LEIGH ANNE	Michael, it wasn't your fault. It could have happened to anybody.. He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices --
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Michael, your arm... what happened? He looks up and into her eyes...
MICHAEL	I stopped it. ON THE FIELD: Michael skips to the line and gets down in his
COTTON	0her! You've got a hundred pounds on Collis and you can't keep him out of our backfield?!
IN THE STANDS	Leigh Anne sits down next to SJ.
LEIGH ANNE	What's. with the camera?
SI	Michael does better when he can see what he's supposed to be doing.
ON THE FIELD	The quarterback drops back to pass. Michael backpedals. When
COTTON	Holding - left tackle! He gets right in Michael's face, grabs his jersey.
COTTON (CONT'D)	You can only grab in here -- at the tits, you got it?! You grab out here or here, we're gonna get flagged and I'm gonna get pissed. Leigh Anne grimaces, shakes her head.
NEXT PLAY	At the snap of the ball Michael tries to pass protect, pushes
COTTON (CONT'D)	Move your feet, son! Keep 'em moving! Back to the huddle! Cotton addresses an ASSISTANT COACH...
COTTON (CONT'D)	Well at least he'll look good coming off the bus. The other team will be terrified 'til they realize he's a marshmallow. As they chuckle, Leigh Anne strides past, onto the field.
LEIGH ANNE	Gimme a minute, Bert.
COTTON	We're in the middle of practice, Leigh Anne!
LEIGH ANNE	You can thank me later. Bert just watches as Leigh Anne walks straight to the huddle
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Do you remember just after we met, and we went to that horrible part of town to buy you those dreadful clothes? And I was a little scared and you told me not to worry, that you had my back?. Do you remember that?
MICHAEL	Yes ma'am.
LEIGH ANNE	If anyone tried to get to me you would have stopped them, right? And when you and Si were in that car wreck, what did you do to that airbag?
MICHAEL	I stopped it. Leigh Anne points to the offense.
LEIGH ANNE	This team is your family. And you have to protect them -- --from those guys. She walks over and grabs the QB, pulls him out.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Tony is your quarterback. You protect his blindside.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	When you look at him, think of me. How you have my back. How you have his. She grabs BOBBY, a short stump of a running back.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	oomaloompah here is your tailback. When you look at him think of SJ and how you'd never let anything or anyone hurt him. Do you understand me?
MICHAEL	What about Mr. Tuohy and Collins?
LEIGH ANNE	I suppose they can be on the team, too. Are you going to protect the family, Michael?
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Yelling at him won't help. He doesn't trust men. In his experience they pretend to care about you 'til they disappear. Cotton chuckles.. She walks over and sits next to SJ, who has
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	You're gonna wanna get this. At the snap Michael drives the defender into the dirt. On a sweep to his side, Michael pushes three defenders
COTTON	What'd you say to him?
LEIGH ANNE	You should get to know your percent in protective instincts. I told you you.could thank me later. Thank you, Leigh Anne.
SEAN	So much for home field advantage.
LEIGH ANNE	You ever seen so many rednecks in one place?
SJ	Nascar, not even close.
COTTON	On the schedule it says this is a home game but don't be deceived, gentlemen. Three fourths of the people in the stands are here from Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your helmets on 'til you're on the sidelines. I don't want anyone getting beaned with a whiskey bottle. Grab a knee. And the team huddles for their prayer...
COTTON (CONT'D)	For we can... Do all things... Through Jesus Christ... Who strengthens us... Each and every day... As they rise to leave--
COTTON (CONT'D)	Oh, one more thing. The reason Milford traveled all that way to come here is they expect to whup your ass. Whup your ass and have a party in your house. Whup your ass, have a party in your house and piss on your mama's new couch. Is that gonna happen? The team erupts with a chorus of NO'.s and HELL NO!s. the other cheek or just bend over?! Another Milford player, #66, spots Michael.
MILFORD #66	Would y'all look at the size of that buck!
JAY COLLIS	Pay 'em back on the field. Coach Cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to
MILFORD DAD	Damn, that ain't fair! They got a big ole' black bear playing for 'em! What is this, a circus?!
MILFORD DAD (CONT'D)	There's the Lions and here come the Christians! SJ turns and gives a dirty look --
LEIGH ANNE	SJ, eyes forward! Sticks and stones...
COTTON	Let's go 0! The offense runs onto the field and huddles. The Milford
MILFORD #66	Look whose fat black ass I get to kick all night long. At the snap #66 sidesteps Michael and sacks the QB.
MILFORD #66 (CONT'D)	All night long, fat ass. All night long.
IN THE STANDS	Leigh Anne and Sean share a look and cheer on the team.
LEIGH ANNE	Come on, Michael! The Milford players high five and both give Michael a Michael hits #66 square in the numbers, putting him on his
REFEREE	Fourth down ! The crusaders offense leaves the field. #66 follows behind
MILFORD #66	And don't come back unless you want me to embarrass your black ass!
COTTON	Get back to your own bench, 66! 66 laughs and struts away. Cotton goes straight to the ref.
COTTON (CONT'D)	Did you hear what he said? Are you gonna just let that kinda talk go?!
REFEREE	Ever heard of the First amendment, Coach? Get back to the sideline. Cotton takes a deep breath, then turns to Michael, who has
COTTON	Look, son, 66 is quick, so just focus on his belt buckle. Where it goes he goes. And block 'til the whistle blows. All right? Michael nods and takes a seat on the bench. Cotton hears Hello?...
IN THE STANDS	Leigh Anne is on the phone.
LEIGH ANNE	Enough with the trick plays, Bert. Just run the dang ball.
AND	Bert, on the field, turns to the stands, shakes his head Behind the Tuohys, the Milford fans are in a frenzy.
MILFORD DAD	That's my boy Jimmy, number 66. He is kicking that blue gum's ass! Leigh Anne can't restrain herself. She rises, turns
LEIGH ANNE	Hey crotch mouth! Yeah, you! Zip it or I'll come zip it for ya! Sean pulls her back down to her seat.
SI	Sticks and stones?
ON THE FIELD	The Milford offense is moving the ball a draw play for ten yards. a screen pass for twenty. an option play - the QB pitches out and the tailback turns Bert Cotton gathers his forces.
COTTON	It's all right. Settle down.
ON THE FIELD	The Crusaders have the ball at the twenty. They break from
MILFORD #66	Big black pile of nigger crap! Cotton is nearby, hears this, races straight over to the Ref.
COTTON	Ref, you gonna do something about this?! He kicked my boy in the head and cussed him! The Ref throws a flag.
COTTON (CONT'D)	Thank you!
REFEREE	Unsportsmanlike conduct on Wingate! Fifteen yards. Shut up or you'll get another fifteen.
COTTON	What happened to the first Amendment?! Cotton throws his hat and another ref throws a flag.
COTTON (CONT'D)	This young man plays for my team and I will defend him like he's my own son! Against you or any other redneck sonofabitch! Michael watches, dumbfounded. He walks over to the livid
MICHAEL	Don't worry, Coach. I got your back. Cotton cools down. Michael trots out onto the field.
REFEREE	Second and 38. IN THE CRUSADERS HUDDLE Michael looks to Tony.
MICHAEL	Try Gap.
TONY	Coach called a pass.
MICHAEL	Gap. As Wingate lines up, 66 is at it again.
MILFORD #66	Your coach always do your fightin' for you? He your Massa?- Michael gets in his stance and on the snap of the ball powers Bobby cuts to the sideline -- Michael is running full speed with 66 now and he keeps going Past Collins and the rest of the cheerleaders while -- Si is on his feet, filming Michael -- Michael keeps going, past the track and toward the fence Just as Bobby races into the end zone --
COLLINS	Way to go big bro! A referee signals touchdown then notices Michael walking back The Ref throws a flag.
COTTON	Now what?! Was he holding?
REFEREE	Uh, no.
COTTON	Did he hit after the whistle?
REFEREE	I don't believe so.
COTTON	Then what's the flag for?
REFEREE	I dunno... . Excessive blocking.
COTTON	You're kidding me. The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the
MICHAEL	Sorry, Coach. I stopped when I heard the whistle.
COTTON	Where were you taking him, Mike?
MICHAEL	To the bus. It was time for him to go home. Cotton smiles proudly and slaps Michael on the ass.
COTTON	Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy! Leigh Anne stands and turns to face the Milford fans
LEIGH ANNE	See number seventy-four? Well, that's MY son.! The Milford fans don't know what to make of this. Leigh Anne Tony throws a touchdown pass -- 66 submarines and Michael pushes him down with one hand -- Scoreboard reads: VISITORS 7 HOME 35 66 limps off the field, shamed and another player takes
SECRETARY	Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold... Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold... And land on TOM LEMMING, the foremost college talent
TOM LEMMING .	Did the monthly recruiting updates get mailed?
SECRETARY	Coach Saban wants his Fed Exed.
TOM LEMMING	Does he really think getting it one day early is gonna give LSU a leg up? An ASSISTANT hurries up.
ASSISTANT	Have you filled all the slots for the Army All Star Game?
TOM LEMMING	Yeah, why? The assistant hands over the distinctive DVD marked MICHAEL
ASSISTANT	You might want to open one up.
TOM LEMMING	Every year there are a dozen running backs in the high school ranks who will make it to the NFL. Quarterbacks maybe three or four. But left tackles, true left tackles, they're freaks, gifts from the gods. A great one only comes around every four or five years. Mike's the best I've seen in ten.
COTTON	You're kidding?
TOM LEMMING	I don't kid about guys who'll get fifty million or more to play football.
COTTON	And you think that could be Michael?
TOM LEMMING	Oh, yeah. The embarrassing thing is it's my business to know every prospect in the nation but if you hadn't sent me that DVD I would have never heard of him.
SEAN	What DVD? I didn't send a DVD.
TOM LEMMING	You're Sean Tuohy, right? Sean "gets it", trades a look with Cotton.
SEAN	Si.
TOM LEMMING	Wow. Just wow. Lemming breaks out a measuring tape and smiles.
COTTON	Tom Lemming runs the biggest recruiting service in the nation. He practically created an industry. Every college coach subscribes to his newsletter. One word from him and... This is big, Sean.
TOM LEMMING	Mike, I came all the way from Chicago just to see for myself. And now that I have, I'd like to extend to you an invitation to play in the Army High School All American game at the end of the season. He places an application on the desk. Michael stares at it.
TOM LEMMING	I don't want to offend but... does Mike have special needs?
SEAN	Well, he eats a lot.
TOM LEMMING	No, I meant, is he mentally... off?
SEAN	No, no, he's just...
COTTON	Shy. Really shy.
TOM LEMMING	Because the only thing he said to me was "No." Said it three times; every time I asked him if he'd like to play in the Army All Star game. I get lobbied by every player, every father, every coach to get into this game. Let me know if he changes his mind. Lemming walks away. After he's gone, Michael emerges.
SEAN	Why didn't you fill out the application, Michael?
MICHAEL	I don't wanna join the Army. Sean and Coach Cotton crack up. NICK SABAN watches on a computer --
PHIL FULMER	I want him! I want him bad. mer, in a bright orange Tennessee shirt, jumps out and starts to trot toward
LEIGH ANNE	Kick higher, Collins. Point your toes! Leigh Anne notices Fulmer. What in the world?... Y'all keep practicing. She strides toward the football practice field.
SOUTHERN MISS COACH	Shoot, man, Fulmer's here. I might as well go home. Fulmer smiles at the assembled coaches, shakes a few-hands.
FULMER	Drove all the way from Knoxville to come see for myself. Leigh Anne slides in near the group so she can eavesdro
CLEMSON ASSISTANT COACH	Heck, I drove from Clemson, that's nine hours! Bert cotton walks over, shakes Fulmer's hand, leaving the
COTTON	Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.
FULMER	Coach Cotton I been keeping an eye on your program. Y'all doing a fine job down here. Wouldn't be a bit surprised to see you coaching at the next level real soon. Cotton's smile tells us he'd like that a lot.
FULMER (CONT`D)	Is that him? Is that O'Hair?
LEIGH ANNE	It's Oher. Like a paddle in a boat. Fulmer notices Leigh Anne, grunts then turns back to Cotton.
FULMER	If you could run him through a few drills, we'd sure appreciate it.. .Cotton gives Leigh Anne a look that says, "get out of here." An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see. The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle.
FULMER	Force equals mass times acceleration. Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and The Clemson coach strides away.
COTTON	Where are you going, Coach?
CLEMSON COACH	Back to South Carolina. I've seen more than enough. If he can qualify with his grades you tell Michael Oher that Clemson wants him.
FULMER	Good luck with that, Brad! Fulmer smiles wide then turns to look once more at Michael. Leigh Anne watches him watch Michael.
LEIGH ANNE	Did you know that to be eligible for a Division One scholarship Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA?
SEAN	Really?
LEIGH ANNE	His ACT is low and I don't see him doing any better if he retakes it.
SEAN	What's his GPA now?
SEAN	Not bad really, when you consider where he started.
LEIGH ANNE	He needs to make A's this year. I'm serious. And that might not even be enough.
SEAN	So he goes to Junior College.
LEIGH ANNE	Most inner city kids that go to JC drop out in a year. His shot at the pros would go out the window.
SEAN	Pros? Are we even sure he's gonna get college offers? She walks over to the answering machine, presses "Play."
ON THE MACHINE	Hello, my name is Nick Saban and I'm the head football coach at Louisiana State University... Tommy Tuberville, Auburn University... We're very interested in having Michael over to Knoxville for a visit.
SEAN	Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?
LEIGH ANNE	There are twenty more. She holds up a stack of mail - envelopes and Fed Exes.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	And these. Fifty of 'em.
SEAN	Any from Ole Miss?
LEIGH ANNE	They won't recruit until they hire a new coach. But none of it matters unless he makes his grades.
SEAN	So, what do we do?
LEIGH ANNE	So here's the plan. E-mail me all assignments and let me know what Michael has to do to make an "A". There is laughter in the room.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)	Okay, fine, a B plus. And if anyone knows of a good tutor I'd love to hear about 'em.
MRS. BOSWELL	I think I know someone.
LEIGH ANNE	I understand that you applied for a teaching position at Wingate?
MISS SUE	I wasn't religious enough for 'em. I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy, but I have certain,. shall we say... doubts.
LEIGH ANNE	I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.
MISS SUE	What's the situation with Michael? He needs to do better in school.
MISS SUE	Obviously. But why the big push?
LEIGH ANNE	He's in line for a football scholarship if he gets his grades up.
MISS SUE	Is he considering Ole Miss?
LEIGH ANNE	He'd better be.
MISS SUE	I'd love to work with him.
LEIGH ANNE	When do you want to start?
MISS SUE	Mrs. Tuohy there's something you should know about me. I don't tell many people, but it's something I feel you should be aware of before you hire me.
LEIGH ANNE	What's that?
MISS SUE	I'm a Democrat.
AT THE TABLE	Michael stares at a problem in Geometry book, then...
MICHAEL	I don't understand it.
MISS SUE	Yet. You don't understand it yet. How big is your head, Michael?
MICHAEL	Big.
MISS SUE	And what's in there?
MICHAEL	A brain.
MISS SUE	A brain. Full of knowledge - like a file cabinet with maps; shortcuts for figuring things out. You will learn this, Michael Oher because I'm here to help you use those maps and reach your destination. Like Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark.
MICHAEL	Sacagawea?
MISS SUE	We'll get to that. And the history books have it wrong, but all you need to you know is that I'll get you there. Do you believe me? Do you trust me, Michael?
MICHAEL	Yes, Miss Sue.
MISS SUE	Try it again. He goes back to the book.
SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE	Sean shakes his head.
SEAN	Who'd a thought we'd have a black son before we knew a Democrat. NICK SABAN, a handsome man wearing a sport jacket and LSU rep
NICK SABAN	And you must be Leigh Anne.
LEIGH ANNE	Yes, Coach Saban, that's me. Leigh Anne. Touhy.
NICK SABAN	Please, call me Nick. What an incredible home. Love the Windsor valances. Thank you. You obviously have good taste.
NICK SABAN	Let's just say I appreciate quality. Michael and SJ walk in. And I know it when I see it. Michael, I'm Nick Saban. And you must be SJ. I hear you have quite a jump shot, young man.
LEIGH ANNE	Nick, why don't you and Michael go into the living room to talk.
MICHAEL	Can SJ come?
SABAN	Absolutely. I'll recruit the both of you. As they walk away, Collins approaches...
LEIGH ANNE	I find him extremely handsome.
SABAN	So, as soon as possible we'd like to get you down to Baton Rouge. We've got a great thing going, Michael and we plan on winning a bunch more National Championships. Whattaya' say, will you commit to a visit? Michael turns to SJ, who raises his hand.
SI	Can I ask a question?
SABAN	Sure.
SJ	My brother and me are very close. I'm worried that if he goes off to school I won't see him so...
SABAN	Go on.
SI	I guess I was just wondering how much access I'd have to him. Saban smiles at the kid's moxie.
SABAN	Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes to LSU I'll get you an all-access pass. How's that sound?
SJ	Sounds good.
MISS SUE	You know this stuff. Just be logical.
NUTT	Hi, I'm Houston Nutt from Arkansas.
FULMER	This is a beautiful home, Ma'am. He is startled to see -- Michael, in briefs, racing down the stairs, carrying Collins,
SI	What level of access can I expect?
TOMMY TUBERVILLE	Your own locker right next to Michael's.
LOU HOLTZ	A Gamecock headdress. Real feathers.
PHIL FULMER	We'll run arm in arm onto the field and you can do the coin toss thingie at the first game.
SI	Sounds real good.
MISS SUE	Have you decided yet, Michael?
MICHAEL	No, Miss Sue.
MISS SUE	But you like Tennessee? It's a good school. Not at the academic level of Ole Miss but they do have an outstanding science department. You know one of the things they're famous for? They work with the FBI to study the effects of the soil on decomposing body parts. Michael is a bit lost.
MISS SUE (CONT'D)	When they find a body the police want to know how long they've been dead. The fine department at Tennessee helps them. They have lots of body parts - arms, legs, hands - from hospitals and medical schools. Do you know where they store them? Right underneath the football field. Michael's eyes widen a bit.
MISS SUE (CONT'D)	So, while it's fine and dandy to have 100,000 fans cheering for you, the bodies you should be worried about are right underneath the turf. Set to poke up through the ground and grab you. She raises a clawed hand (think "CARRIE") to make her point.
MISS SUE (CONT'D)	But it's your decision where you play football. Don't let me influence you. The Blind Side Green Revision - 04/28/09 104
LEIGH ANNE	Congrats on gettin' hired, Coach.
ED ORGERON	Thank yew, Ma'am. Ole Miss is my dream job.
LEIGH ANNE	Coach 0, you're coming a little late to the party but we're diehard Rebels so I'm gonna give you a frickin' road map, okay?
ED ORGERON	Yes 'm.
LEIGH ANNE	LSU is out. Everybody knows Saban's going to the NFL. So when he comes for his visit to Ole Miss, don't take him to some titty bar and give him tequila shots. He'll have nightmares for weeks. Feed him Italian - he likes Fettucine Alfredo - take him to a movie - but not Chainsaw massacre because he'll just cover his eyes - and put him to bed by ten. You got it?
ED ORGERON	Yes'm. What about Tennessee?
LEIGH ANNE	It breaks my heart but they're still in the hunt. Fulmer offered SJ a sweet deal.
ED ORGERON	I hear the kid can really pepper the gumbo.
LEIGH ANNE	He's his daddy's boy.
ED ORGERON	You a Ole Miss tackle, son. I'm buildin' my line, buildin' my team aroun' you. Make your parents proud, come to Oxford, get that sheepskin and help us win the SEC. Michael nods, turns to SJ. Before SJ can raise his hand --
ED ORGERON (CONT'D)	And for you, Si, here's what I can do. At Ole Miss we have The Grove by the stadium. And the team walks it before the game, surrounded by thousands of fans. It's a sacred ritual. And I'm in front.
SI	Seen it a thousand times.
ED ORGERON	Ever seen it from the front of the line? Next year, you and me -- leading the team.
SI	Tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin.
ED ORGERON	I'll throw in a sideline pass. Si considers this, smiles and nods. Michael, at a table, stares at three caps -- Tennessee, LSU
FULMER	This stinks to high heaven.
BOB	I will not give a student a grade he, or she, doesn't deserve.
LEIGH ANNE	He needs a B. What's he gonna have to do to "deserve" that?
BOB	Right now Michael's doing C minus, D plus work. His best chance at improving is with the written essay at the end of the year. It counts for a third of his grade.
LEIGH ANNE	That's it. We're sunk.
MISS SUE	Why not write about "Great Expectations"? You're a lot like Pip. He was poor, an orphan and someone sort of found him. You should be able to relate to that. Michael shrugs. Sean is nearby, watching NBA basketball.
MISS SUE (CONT'D)	Fine, let's go through the reading list. But you have to pick one, Michael. "Pygmalion"... "A Tale of Two Cities"... "The Charge of the Light Brigade"...
SEAN	"Half a league, half a league, half a league onward." I love that one.
MISS SUE	Fine, you do this and I'll watch basketball. Miss Sue walks over, takes the remote from Sean, who rises.
SEAN	"All in the valley of Death rode the six hundred". They call LSU's stadium Death Valley because of this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson is writing about Ole Miss-LSU.
MICHAEL	You're kidding?
SEAN	No. It's a great story.
MISS SUE	It's a poem.
SEAN	"Forward the Light Brigade!" That's like the offense. "Charge for the guns'he said." That's the end zone. "Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred." He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed.
SEAN (CONT'D)	"Forward the Light Brigade! Was there a man dÂ±smay'd? Not tho' the soldier knew someone had blundered."
MICHAEL	Someone made a mistake?
SEAN'	Yeah, their leader, their coach.
MICHAEL	Why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up?
SEAN	"Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die: Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred." It hits Michael. He takes a moment, looks right at Sean.
MICHAEL	They all gonna die, aren't they?
SEAN	Yeah.
MICHAEL	That's really, really sad.
SEAN	I think you just found something to write about. Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen.
MICHAEL (V.0.)	Courage is a hard thing to figure. You can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake, but you're not supposed to question adults, or your coach, or your teacher because they make the rules. Maybe they know best but maybe they don't.
MICHAEL (V.0.)	It all depends on who you are, where you come from. Didn't at least one of the six hundred guys think about giving up and joining with the other side? I mean, Valley of Death, that's pretty salty stuff.
MICHAEL (V.0.)	That's why courage is tricky. Should you always do what others tell you to do? Sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something. I mean, any fool can have courage.
MICHAEL (V.0.)	But honor, that's the real reason you either do something or you don't. It's who you are and maybe who you want to be. If you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and that's pretty good.
MICHAEL (V.0.)	I think that's what the writer was saying. That you should try for courage and hope for honor. And maybe even pray that the people telling you what. to do have some, too. Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles. What? Michael's final GPA. Got it off Paul's computer. He did it, Sean. He did it! Sean grins, then...
SEAN	Wait a minute. You broke into the principal's computer? She ignores him and opens her program, letting Sean know that
SANDSTROM	Michael Jerome Oher. Even though no one is supposed to clap, a spontaneous round
SEAN	Where'd you find a baby picture of Michael?
LEIGH ANNE	Scanned it off an Internet ad for a toddler boutique. Tell a soul and I'll rip your tongue out. IN THE CROWD: The Tuohys, Big Tony, Miss Sue, Bob and the
SEAN	I want you to know something. You'n me, okay? I never believed you could do this. But you did. And I'm as proud of you as I am ashamed of myself. I should know better. I'll never doubt you again, Michael. Michael smiles, nods, gives Leigh Anne a little hug then raps
LEIGH ANNE	Excuse me young man, but I think I need a proper hug. He smiles and moves to her. Off their embrace
LEIGH ANNE	You'll be living in Deaton Hall -- here. You'll have a meal plan and you'll go to Johnson commons to eat. Johnson Commons has all you can eat self-serve ice cream.
MICHAEL	As much as you want?
SEAN	Yep, that's how Mama put on her freshman ten. Leigh Anne rolls up a pamphlet and whacks him hard on her way
LEIGH ANNE	Hello... This is Mrs. Tuohy... As she listens she gives Sean a look - "This isn't good". Leigh Anne walks with Michael.
LEIGH ANNE	They just want to ask you a few questions. You've got nothing to hide, Michael. They arrive at a door, open it.
GRANGER	Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher? My name is Jocelyn Granger and I'm the Assistant Director of Enforcement for the NCAA.
LEIGH ANNE	Please call me Leigh Anne. Leigh Anne shakes her hand and she and Michael move to the
GRANGER	Mrs. Tuohy, I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.
LEIGH ANNE	How long will this take?
GRANGER	Awhile. Michael starts rubbing his knees, nervous as hell.
LEIGH ANNE	Michael, I'll be outside. Leigh Anne pecks his cheek and exits, giving Michael one last
LEIGH ANNE	I've got a bad feeling about this, Sean. This broad is tough. Oh,. Susie's on the other line. Hey... . what does the client want?... But that's tacky... You know what, fine, if she wants her living room to look like a bordello make it happen. She hangs up, checks her watch and looks toward the building.
GRANGER	Your parents are friends with Coach Bert Cotton, correct?
MICHAEL	Coach is a good guy.
GRANGER	Were you aware that Coach Cotton is accepting a job at Ole Miss? And that this job offer came after you signed with them? Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian went to Ole Miss.
MICHAEL	He played basketball.
GRANGER	And Mrs. Tuohy attended Ole Miss as well.
MICHAEL	She was a cheerleader.
GRANGER	Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is their favorite school? Do they like any other Universities? What about, say Tennessee?
MICHAEL	They can't stand Tennessee.
GRANGER	So they wouldn't be happy if you chose to play football there?
MICHAEL	No.
GRANGER	And your tutor...
MICHAEL	Miss Sue.
GRANGER	Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too. Did Miss Sue try to persuade you to attend Ole Miss? Did you know that the Tuohys make generous donations to Ole Miss? That even Miss Sue makes donations? That the:Tuohy's have a condo in Oxford so they can attend as many athletic events as possible? That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy are by our definition "boosters."
MICHAEL	What's that mean?
GRANGER	A booster is someone with an abnormal interest in a school's sports. Someone who-contributes financially to the University's athletic program. Michael doesn't answer, just keeps rubbing his knees. Then
GRANGER (CONT'D)	Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here? Mr. Oher?...
GRANGER	Do you know, do you understand why I'm here?
MICHAEL (V.0.)	To... investigate.
GRANGER	Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate your odd... predicament. Do you find it odd? Your predicament? Michael?...
MICHAEL	Iono... she sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents -
MICHAEL (CONT'D)	Can I... can I leave now? No. You can't. Michael's building up anxiety by the second.
MICHAEL	What do you want, ma'am?
GRANGER	What I want, what my job is, is to discern whether something untoward occurred in your recruitment to Ole Miss.
MICHAEL	Unto...
GRANGER	I want the facts. I need the truth.
MICHAEL	I didn't lie...
GRANGER	And I want to know what you think about all this.
THINK ABOUT WHAT?!	It's the first time we've ever heard Michael raise his voice.
GRANGER	The NCAA fears that with your recruitment a door might be opened that boosters from lots of schools in the south will become legal guardians for young athletes without means and funnel them to their Alma Maters. Michael still doesn't get it, shakes his head.
GRANGER (CONT'D)	I'm not saying I believe it and I'm not saying I don't, but there are many people involved with this case who would argue that the Tuohys took you in, fed you, clothed you, paid for your private education --
MICHAEL	No...no...no...
GRANGER	-- bought you a car and paid for a tutor all as part of a plan to insure that you played football for the University of Mississippi. Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long
GRANGER (CONT'D)	Michael, we're not finished. But he's gone.
LEIGH ANNE	Michael, what's wrong? He looks at her, glares really; upset.
MICHAEL	Why'd you do it?
LEIGH ANNE	What?
MICHAEL	All along you wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
LEIGH ANNE	Well, of course, but...
MICHAEL	Why did you do this for me?!
LEIGH ANNE	What?
MICHAEL	Everything! Was it for you or was it for me? Was it so I would go to school where you wanted?! Was it so I would do what you wanted?!
LEIGH ANNE	No, Michael...
MICHAEL	That's what she thinks! Is she right?! Don't you dare lie to me! Leigh Anne digests this, takes a breath...
LEIGH ANNE	Michael, look... I can see where, where some people might... Her inability, for the first time, to articulate, hits
MICHAEL	I'm not stupid! He turns and walks away.
LEIGH ANNE	Michael?! But she doesn't move, just watches him go.
LEIGH ANNE	Well if he comes by there let me know. Thanks. Michael, please call me and let me know you're okay.
LEIGH ANNE	Text him SJ.
SEAN	Keep it light. Tell him you're gonna take his truck for a spin if he doesn't get in touch. SJ starts texting. Leigh Anne and Sean stare at each other. Sean sits in bed and Leigh Anne paces.
LEIGH ANNE	I should have followed him.
SEAN	You had no way of knowing he'd disappear.
LEIGH ANNE	Was he right? What he said about us?
SEAN	Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts. We gave him a bed. To hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again tomorrow.
LEIGH ANNE	What about the rest of it - all the stuff we did to make sure he got a scholarship? A scholarship to Ole Miss.
SEAN	He could go wherever he wanted, he knew that.
LEIGH ANNE	Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I know for sure I never did. Sean considers this, then beckons.
SEAN	Come here, honey. She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her
LEIGH ANNE	Am I a good person? Not a joke. Not rhetorical.
SEAN	You're the best person I know. Everything you do, you do for others.
LEIGH ANNE	Why is that?
SEAN	I have not a clue. You obviously get some sick satisfaction from it. She looks at him. There's truth in his words.
LEIGH ANNE	Sean... what if he never comes back? Alton opens his door to make a transaction with an addict'and
ALTON	That you Big Mike? Get your ass in here.
MICHAEL	I'm looking for Moms.
ALTON	Your Mama? Oh, I seen Dee Dee around. She usually stop by for a taste around this time. Tell you what, I'll get you a forty and we'll chop it up 'til she get here. Michael hesitates. Alton smiles, beckons. Next to them an INFANT cries in a broken down crib. In the
ALTON	It's good to see you, Big Mike. You lookin' fit. I heard you playin' some ball.
MICHAEL	Yeah.
ALTON	But you know that rich kid football ain't like the public school league. People packing knives in their socks. Back in the day I was a quarterback. You knew that, right? At MLK.
MICHAEL	Yeah, I heard. You still playing ball over at the
DAVID	Naw.
ALTON	He with me now! I'll open a spot for you, too.
DAVID	Got tired of going to class. Always somebody tellin' me what to do.
ALTON	Turn it up, bitch! David jumps up and cranks the volume on a RAP SONG until the You stayin' to the other side of town, that's what Dee Dee said. Said you got a new Mama. She fine, too. I seen her when she come to see Dee Dee.
MICHAEL	She came here?
ALTON	She got any other kids? She got a daughter? You tap that? Michael sets down the beer, rises to leave.
ALTON (CONT'D)	Where you going? Sit down. I wanna hear about your fine white sister. 'Cause I like me some mommy/daughter.
MICHAEL	Shut up. Alton steps in front of Michael, raises his hands ---
ALTON	Shutup?You tellin' me to shut up?I'llcap your fat ass. Cap yourass,drive east and pay a visittoyour Cracker Mama and her Michael shoves him hard. Alton unprepared for the force, Michael screams like a banshee, spins, grabs them and tackles Michael looks to David, frozen in the corner, then over to He grabs his head and heaves, trying to make it all stop -
PULSING FLASHBACK IMAGES	MICHAEL, AGE SEVEN, and several half brothers and sisters in He grabs her waist and is pulled away by an officer.
ALTON	He gone. Leigh Anne stops, looks to Alton.
ALTON (CONT'D)	But you tell him I'll be seeing him around. You tell him he'll get his.
LEIGH ANNE	Michael was here?
ALTON	Last night. Sneaked me then took off like a little bitch. So you tell him, sleep with one eye open. Yod'hear me, bitch?' Leigh Anne steps closer to Alton, stares him down.
LEIGH ANNE	No, you hear me, bitch. You threaten my son you threaten me. You so much as cross downtown you'll be sorry. I'm in a prayer group with the D.A., I'm a member of the NRA and I am always packing. She taps her tiny purse. Alton laughs.
ALTON	What you got in there, a .22? You got yourself a Saturday Night Special?
LEIGH ANNE	And it shoots just fine all the other days, too. She turns on her heels and strides to her car.
LEIGH ANNE	Michael?!!!
MICHAEL'S VOICE	Mama?...
MICHAEL (V.0.)	You think the police gonna come and get me?
LEIGH ANNE	I'd imagine the last thing anybody at Hurt Village wants is cops snooping around. I swore I'd never ask but... how'd you make it out of there, Michael?
MICHAEL	When I was little and something awful was happening, my Mama would tell me to close my eyes.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)	She was tryin' to keep me from seeing her do drugs or other bad things. And she'd say, "keep 'em closed till I say so." And then when she was finished or the bad things were over she'd say, "now when I count to three, you open your eyes and the past is gone, the world is a good place, and it's all gonna be okay."
LEIGH ANNE	You closed your eyes. He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare You know, when I was driving all over Kingdom Come looking for you I just kept thinking about one thing. Ferdinand the bull. Everyone assumed because he was big that he wanted to fight in the ring. But he just wanted to sit under a tree and smell the flowers. I know I should have asked this a long time ago but do you even wanna play football? I mean, do you even like it?' Michael considers this.
MICHAEL	I'm pretty good at it.
LEIGH ANNE	Yeah, you are. Sean and I have been talking and Michael, if you're gonna accept a football scholarship we think it should be from Tennessee. And I promise you I will be at every game cheering for you.
MICHAEL	Every game?
LEIGH ANNE	But I will not wear that gaudy orange of theirs because it's not in my color wheel.
MICHAEL	You want me to go to Tennessee?
LEIGH ANNE	I want you to go wherever you want. It's your decision, Michael. It's your life.
MICHAEL	What if I wanted to flip burgers? She takes this in, swallows hard and
LEIGH ANNE	Your decision; your life. Michael smiles.
MICHAEL	Okay.
LEIGH ANNE	Okay, what?
MICHAEL	I'm sorry I left the other day.
GRANGER	You were pretty upset.
MICHAEL	You ask a lot of questions.
GRANGER	I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
MICHAEL	But all the questions you asked were about why everybody else wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
GRANGER	Okay...
MICHAEL	You asked about everybody but me. You never asked why I wanted to go there.
GRANGER	Alright, fine, Michael... why do you want to go to Ole Miss?
MICHAEL	It's where my family goes to school. It's where they've always gone to school. Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just
LEIGH ANNE	College is going to be a different experience for you. There are lots of distractions.
SEAN	Just have fun.
LEIGH ANNE	There'll always be some nimrod in the dorm who wants to play video games all night, or goof off on the internet.
SEAN	You're gonna have a great time. I know I did. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look - "You're not helping."
LEIGH ANNE	You'll spend lots of time at practice which means you have to be very dedicated to your studies.
MISS SUE (O.S.)	Relax, Mama. Miss Sue walks up carrying papers.
MISS SUE (CONT'D)	Just got back from the library where I reserved a private cubicle for the semester. Here's your class schedule and our study hall hours. She reaches in her purse for her keys.
MISS SUE (CONT'D)	Now, if y'all don't mind I'm gonna go move into my new apartment. She walks away.
LEIGH ANNE	Thank you, Miss Sue.
MISS SUE	Yeah, yeah, yeah... Sean and Michael and SJ eye a GROUP OF ATTRACTIVE COEDS
SEAN	Have a lot of fun. Leigh Anne notices their looks.
LEIGH ANNE	Michael Oher, you listen to me. I want you to enjoy yourself but you need to know that if you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock I will climb in the car, drive here to Oxford and cut off your penis.
SI	She means it.
MICHAEL	Yes ma'am. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look that says, "let's get on the
MICHAEL (CONT'D)	Thank you, Mama. Overwhelmed, she turns for the car with a little wave.
LEIGH ANNE	The 78'll be a parking lot. We should go. She gets inside and closes the door for privacy.
MICHAEL	Why does she always do that?
SEAN	She's an onion, Michael. You have to peel her one layer at a time. Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window. She
LEIGH ANNE	What?
MICHAEL	I need a proper hug. She gets out of the car and holds him for a long time.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	I read a story the other day about a boy from the projects. No daddy, in and out of foster care. He'd been killed in a gang fight at Hurt Village. A newspaper photo of a dead boy from the.projects. Then
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	In the last paragraph they talked about his superb athletic skills and how different his life might have been if he hadn't fallen behind and dropped out of school. He was twenty-one years old the day he died. It was his birthday. Lonely, falling apart.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	That could have been anyone. It could have been my son, Michael. Beautiful on a fall day. And then THE STILL COMES TO LIFE
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE	But it wasn't. And I suppose I have God to thank for that. God and Lawrence Taylor.
