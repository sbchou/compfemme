JULIE	Ready Pappa.
FARMER	Thank you darling, now go inside and take care of your mother. Don't run. Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her. .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER. We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

NAZI OFFICER	Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?
FARMER	I am Perrier LaPadite. The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
NAZI OFFICER	It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S. COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
PERRIER	How may I help you?
COL LANDA	I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion. The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife, The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.
PERRIER	Colonel Landa, this is my family. The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
COL LANDA	Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame, at your service. He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
COL LANDA	please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.
FARMERS WIFE	Don't be ridiculous, heer Col. While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
COL LANDA	Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a beautiful woman. His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters. And each of your daughters is more lovely then the last.
PERRIER	Merci. Please have a seat. The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;
PERRIER	Charlotte, would you be so good as to get The Colonel some wine?
COL LANDA	Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine. This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk?
CHARLOTTE	Oui.
COL LANDA	Then milk is what I prefer.
CHARLOTTE	Very Well. The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
COL LANDA	Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows, I say; Bravo.
PERRIER	Merci.
COL LANDA	Please, join me at your table.
PERRIER	Very well. The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from The Women remain standing. Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of
COL LANDA	Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss,' would be better discussed in private. You'll notice, I left my men outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside.
PERRIER	You are right. G.
PERRIER	Charlotte, would you take the girls outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words. The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
COL LANDA	Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me. However, I've been lead to believe you speak English quite well?
PERRIER	Oui.
COL LANDA	Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation?
PERRIER	By all means. They now speak ENGLISH;
COL LANDA	Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very familiar with you, and your family. I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware of my existence? The Farmer answers;
PERRIER	Yes.
COL LANDA	This is good. Are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
PERRIER	Yes. The Colonel drinks more milk.
COL LANDA	Please tell me what you've heard?
PERRIER	I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding, or passing for Gentile. The S.S.Colonel smiles.
COL LANDA	The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better himself.
PERRIER	But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me. The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews, and found nothing.
COL LANDA	I'm aware of that, I read the report on this area. But like any enterprise, when under new management, there's always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless. I just have A few questions Monsieur LaPadite, if you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family. Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
COL LANDA	Now before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself. The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins, and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?
PERRIER	To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers. - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe? Looking up from his papers.
COL LANDA	Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house, make yourself comfortable. The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
COL LANDA	Now according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished. Which leads me to the conclusion that they've ether made good their escape, or someone is very successfully hiding them. the table at The What have you heard about The Dreyfusis Monsieur LaPadite?
PERRIER	Only rumors -
COL LANDA	- I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding The Dreyfusis? The Farmerlooks at Landa.
COL LANDA	Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you. The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.
PERRIER	Again, this is just a rumor - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain.
COL LANDA	So the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
PERRIER	Yes.
COL LANDA	Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis friendly? As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
FIVE HUMAN BEINGS	lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
PERRIER	We were families in the same community, in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say we were friends, but members of the same community, we had common interest. The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
COL LANDA	Having never met the Dreyfusis, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
PERRIER	There were five of them. The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram... her brother, Bob ...
COL LANDA	- How old is Bob?
PERRIER	Thirty - thirty one?
COL LANDA	Continue.
PERRIER	And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.
COL LANDA	Ages of the children?
PERRIER	Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna, was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really sure. The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the They can't hear anything going on inside. e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.
COL LANDA	Well I guess that should do it. Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.
COL LANDA	However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
PERRIER	But of course. Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
COL LANDA	Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
PERRIER	I have no interest in such things.
COL LANDA	But you are aware of what they call me?
PERRIER	I'm aware.
COL LANDA	What are you aware of?
PERRIER	That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".
COL LANDA	Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in repeating it. Before he was assassinated, Heydrich apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him. Actually why he would hate the name, "The Hangman", is baffling to me It would appear he did everything in his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I've earned it. As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
COL LANDA	The feature that makes me such a effective hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a jew. where they can only think like a German, or more precisely, a German soldier. Now if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk. COL LANDA Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips - smell - physical strength - penis size. But, if one were to determine what attributes the jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat. Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. Where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison a insult. Consider for a moment, the world a rat lives in. It's a hostile world indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now, would you greet it with hostility?
PERRIER	I suppose I would.
COL LANDA	Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
PERRIER	Rat's spread disease, they bite people -
COL LANDA	- Unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one, rats don't make it a practise of biting human beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life? I purpose to you, any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry. Yet I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
PERRIER	No.
COL LANDA	Yet, they are both rodent's, are they not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don't they?
PERRIER	It is a interesting thought, beer Colonel.
COL LANDA	However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper through your door, this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk?
PERRIER	Probably not.
COL LANDA	I didn't think so. You don't like them. You don't really know why you don't like them. All you know is, you find them repulsive.
METAPHOR	What a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure. Yet, not only does he survive, he thrives. And the reason for this, is because our little foe has a instinct for survival and presavation second to none. And that Monsieur, is what a jew shares with a rat. Consequently, a German soldier, conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar - he looks everywhere, he would hide. But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However the reason the Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria, and placed me in French cow country today, is because it does occur to me. Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity. May I smoke my pipe as well? Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding.
PERRIER	Please, Cononel, make yourself at home. The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
COL LANDA	The other mistake the German soldier make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews. These citizens are not enemies of the state. They are simply confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates. These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be reminded of their duty in war time. Let's use you as a example Monsieur LaPadite. In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet, here you are. So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose a question. In this time of war, what is your number one duty? Is it to fight the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or, is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your ability? Or, is it to protect the poor unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect themselfs? Or, is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed, to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family? The Colonel lets the last statement stand.
COL LANDA	That was a question Monsieur LaPadite. In this time of war, What do you consider your number one duty?
PERRIER	To protect my family.
COL LANDA	Now, my job dictates, that I must have my men enter your home, and conduct a thorough search, before I can officially cross your families name off my list. And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured, they will be. That is unless, you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary. I might add also, that any information that makes the preforming of My duty easier, will not be met with punishment. Actually quite the contrary, it will be met with reward. And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in anyway, by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country. The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
COL LANDA	You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
PERRIER	Yes.
COL LANDA	Your sheltering them underneath your floorboards aren't you?
PERRIER	Yes.
COL LANDA	Point out to me the area's where their hiding. The Farmer points out the area's on the floor with the Dreyfusis are
COL LANDA	Since I haven't heard any disturbance, I assume that while their listening, they don't speak english?
PERRIER	Yes .
COL LANDA	I'm going to switch back to french now, and I want you to follow my masquerade - is that clear?
PERRIER	Yes. Colonel Landa stands up from the table, and switching to FRENCH says
COL LANDA	Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for milk, and your hospitably. I do believe our business here is done. The Nazi Officer opens the front door, and silently motions for his

DRIVER	Why did yoy allow a enemy of the state to escape? Oh, I don't think the state is in too much danger, do you?
DRIVER	I suppose not.
COL LANDA	I'm glad you see it my way. Besides, not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen year old girl, and allowing her to escape, our not nessessarlly the same thing. She's a young girl, no food, no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed the massacre of her entire family. She may not survive the night. And after word spreads about what happened today, it's highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid. If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll probably be turned in by some neighbour. Or, she'll be spotted by some German soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the woods, dead from starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will elude capture. She will escape to America. She will move to New York city. Where she will be elected, President of the United States. The S.S. Colonel chuckles at his little funny. A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.
LT.ALDO	My name is Lt.Aldo Raine, and I'm puttin together a special team. And I need me eight soldiers. Eight - Jewish - American - soldiers. Now y'all might of heard rumors about the armada happening soon. Well, we'll be leavin a little earlier. We're gonna be dropped into France, dressed as civilians. And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwackin, guerrilla army, we're gonna be doin one thing, and thing only, Killin Nazi's. The Members of the National Socialist Party, have conquered Europe through murder, torture, intimidation, and terror. And that's exactly what we're gonna do to them. Now I don't know bout y'all? But I sure as hell, didnt come down from the goddamn Smoky mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin air-o-plane, to teach the Nazi's lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. There the foot soldiers of a Jew hatin, mass murderin manic, and they need to be destroyed. That's why any and every son-of-a--bitch we find wearin a Nazi uniform, there gonna die. if. We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty, they will know who we are. They will find the evidence of our cruelty, in the disembowed, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the Germans, will be sickened by us. And the Germans, will talk about us. And the Germans, will fear us. And when the Germans close their eyes at night, and their sub conscious tortures them for the evil they've done, it will be with thoughts of us, that it tortures them with. He stops pacing, and looks at everybody.
LT. ALDO	Sound good? They all say;
ALL	Yes, sir!
LT.ALDO	That's what I like to hear. But I got a word of warning to all would-be warriors. When you join my command, you take on debit. A debit you owe me, personally. Every man under my command, owes me, one hundred nazi scalps. And I want my scalps. And all y'all will git me, one hundred Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead Nazi's... .or you will die trying. A huge Chalet on a misty mountain top in Barvia. In a huge room, ADOLPH HITLER, pounds on a big table with
HITLER	How much more of these jew swine must I endure? They butcher my men like they were fish bait! This pack of filthy degenerates, are doing what the Russian army didn't, and Patton's army couldn't. Turning soldiers of The Third Reich, into superstitious old women!
GERMAN GENERAL	Just the cowards among them mine Fuhrer. Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.
HITLER	No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard the rumors myself! Solders of The Third Reich, who have brought the world to there knee`s, now pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up, in their fear induced delirium? The one that beats my boys with a bat. The one they call "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem. A avenging jew angel, conjured up by a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!
GENERAL	Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers gossip, no one really believes The Bear Jew is a golem.
HITLER	Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture like a aberration. They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will. You want to prove their flesh and blood? Then BRING THEM TO ME! I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the eiffel tower! And then throw their bodies in the sewers, for the rats of Paris to feast! The Fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself, and The Bear Jew. He hits the button on the intercom on his desk. KLIEST VOICE comes out of the intercom;
KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)	Year mine Fuhrer.
HITLER	I have a order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France. The Jew degenerate known as The Bear Jew, hence forth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again. We will cease to aid the Americans any longer in there attempt to undermine the German soldier psyche. Did you get that Kliest?
KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)	Yes mine Fubrer. Do you still wish to see Private Butz?
HITLER	Who and what is a private Butz?

BASTERD PFC.HIRSCHBERG	KICKS Sgt.Rachtman in the back.
PFC.HIRSCHBERG	You! Go! Sgt.Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
NARRATOR(VO)	Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many interrogations since Germany decided it should rule Europe. But this is the first time he's ever been on the wrong end of the exchange. It's always been his belief, only a weakling, in mind, body, and spirt complies with the enemy under threat of consequence. As Werner watched men cry like women, pleadingly offer their knowledge, in exchange for their worthless lives, he made a vow to himself. If his role is to die in this conflict. When they put him under the earth, his dignity would be buried with him. For in the other world, the gods only respect the ones they test first. Well Sgt, this is your test. And the gods are watching. The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds, Sgt.Werner Rachtman. Aldo returns the salute, looking up at him.
LT.ALDO	Lt.Aldo Raine, pleased to meet cha. You know what sit down means Werner?
SGT.RACHTMAN	Yes.
LT.ALDO	Then sit down. The German Sgt does.
LT.ALDO	Hows your English Werner? Cause if need be, we gotta a couple fellas can translate. Aldo points at one of The Basterds in the circle,
LT.ALDO	Wicki there, a Austrian Jew, got the fuck outta Saltzberg, while the gettin was good. Became American, got drafted, and came back to give y'all what for. Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big scary looking
LT.ALDO	And another one over there, you might be familiar with, Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz. Heard of 'em. The two German Sgt's look at each other.
SGT.RACHTMAN	Everybody in the German army's heard of Hugo Stiglitz. The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back.
NARRATOR(VO)	The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple. WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
NARRATOR(VO)	As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly Majors.
NARRATOR(VO)	Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin, to be made a example of. Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
NARRATOR(VO)	Needless to say, once The Basterds heard about him, he never got there. The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
LT.ALDO	Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz? Hugo nods.
LT. ALDO	I'm Lt.Aldo Raine, and these are The Basterds. Ever heard of us? Hugo nods his head, yes.
LT.ALDO	We just wanna say, we're a big fan of your work. When it comes to killin Nazi's, I think you show great talent, and I pride myself on havin a eye for that kind of talent. But your status as a Nazi killer, is still amateur. We all came here to see, if you wanna go pro?
LT.ALDO	Now Werner, I'm gonna assume you know who we are?
SGT.RACHTMAN	Aldo the Apache. The circle of Basterds giggle.
LT.ALDO	Well Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard, we ain't in the prisoner takin business. We in the killin Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin. The Basterds laugh.
LT. ALDO	Now that leaves two ways we can play this out. Either kill ya, or let ya go. Now weather or not you gonna leave this circle alive, depends entirely on you. Aldo takes out a map of the area, and lays it out in front
LT.ALDO	Up the road a piece, there's a orchard. 'sides you, we know there's another kraut patrol fuckin around here somewhere. Now if that patrol were to have any crackshots, that orchard, would be a goddamn snipers delight. Now if you ever wanna eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you gotta show me on this map, where they are, you gotta tell me how many they are, and you gotta tell me, what kinda artillery they carrying with 'em?
SGT.RACHTMAN	You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger?
LT.ALDO	well, Werner that's where your wrong. Because that's exactly what I expect. I need to know about Germans hidin in trees? And you need to tell me? And you need to tell me, right now? Now take your finger, and point out on this map, where this partys bein held, how manys comin, and what they brought to play with? Werner site, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
SGT.WERNER	F I respectfully refuse, sir. Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.
LT.ALDO	You see that ole boy battin rocks? WE RACK FOCUS to a one of The Basterds not in the circle. Werners eyes go to the ballplayer.
LT.ALDO	That's Sgt.Donny Donowitz. But you might know him better by his nickname, The Bear Jew. Now if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about The Bear Jew?
SGT.RACHTMAN	I heard.
LT.ALDO	What did you hear?
SGT.RACHTMAN	He beats German soldiers with a club.
LT.ALDO	He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
SGT.DONOWITZ	back to us, still haven't seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
LT. ALDO	Now Werner, I'm gonna ask you one last-goddamn-time, and if you still, "respectfully refuse", I'm callin The Bear Jew over here, and he's gonna take that big bat of his, and he's gonna beat your ass to death with it. Now take your wennersitnitzel lickin finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
SGT.RACHTMAN	Fuck you and your jew dogs. Instead of getting mad, The Basterds burst out LAUGHING. Aldo says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice;
LT.ALDO	Actually Werner, we're all tickled ya said that. Frankly, watchin Donny beat Nazi's,to death, is the closest we ever get to goin to the movies.
SGT.DONOWITZ	he turns to CAMERA, and yells;
SGT.DONOWITZ	Yeah?
LT.ALDO	Got a German here wants to die for country. Oblige him.
SGT.DONNY DONOWITZ	Bat over his shoulder, smiles. Donny, cutting heads, in his pop's barber shop, in Bostin.
DONNY	.ya got the goddamn fuckin Germans, declaring open season on Jews in Europe, and I'm suppose to fly to the fuckin Philippines, and fight a bunch of fuckin Japs - not me pal. If we just go in this against the Japs, the whole U.S.of fuckin A can go take a running jump at the moon.

MR.GOOROWITZ	Good for you son. Kill one of those Nazi basterds for me, will ya?
DONNY	That's the idea, Mr.Goorowitz.
MR.GOOROWITZ	What can I do you for, Donny?
DONNY	I need a baseball bat. The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats init.
MR.GOOROWITZ	You gettin your little brother a present before you ship out? Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up;
DONNY	No. Donny's "no", silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
DONNY	Can I try this one on for size, outside? Extending his arm;
MR.GOOROWITZ	Be my guest. The phone rings.
MR.GOOROWITZ	I'll get that, you go right ahead. The proprietor answers the phone, and gets into a Donny starts swinging the bat. It's pretty obvious he's pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then the
DONNY	Take that ya Nazi basterd! You like fuckin with the Jews? Wanna Fuck with the Jews? The American jews are gonna FUCK with you... ..! Mr.Goorowitz, see's none of this, as he speaks to his
DONNY	Is this the heaviest ya got? A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
OLD WOMAN	How can I help you?
DONNY	Mrs.Himmelstein?
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	State your business young man.
DONNY	Mrs.Himmelstein, I'm Donny Donowitz, my father Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on Greeny Ave, "Sy's Barber Shop".
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	I've seen it. Do you live in the neighbourhood?
DONNY	All my life.
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	Again, state your business?
DONNY	May I have a word with you?
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	What about?
DONNY	Our people in Europe. She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	Come in. Would you like some tea?
DONNY	Very good.
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	If you like tea. Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
DONNY	Mrs.Himmelstein, do you have any love ones over in Europe who your concerned for?
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	What compels you young man, to ask a stranger such a personal question?
DONNY	Because I'm going to Europe. And I'm gonna make it right.
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	And just how do intend to do that, Joshua? And what exactly do you intend to do with that toy?
DONNY	I'm gonna beat every Nazi I find to death with it.
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	I thought we were having tea together?
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of service?
DONNY	I'm going through the neighbourhood. If you have any love ones in Europe, who's safety you fear for, I'd like you to write their name on my bat.
BACK TO BASTERDS	Donny takes a long walk to Werner...
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	You must be a real BASTERD, Donny?
DONNY	You bet your sweet ass I am.
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	Good. A Basterds work is never done. Specially in Germany. Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi;
DONNY	Gimmie your papers. Werner hands Donny up his papers. Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN	Hand me your sword Gideon. I do believe I will join you on this journey.
INSERT	she signs the BAT, "MADELEINE"
BACK TO BASTERDS	Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
PVT.BUTZ	watches. Hirschberg says to him;
PFC.HIRSCHBERG	About now, I'd be shittin my pants, if I was you. Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him.
PFC.HIRSCHBERG	That means you, cup cake. A crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.
LT.ALDO	You wanna live?
PVT.BUTZ	Yes, sir.
LT.ALDO	Point out on this map, the German position. His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the 3 s.
PVT.BUTZ	This area here.
LT.ALDO	How many?
PVT.BUTZ	Maybe twelve.
LT.ALDO	What kinda of artillery?
PVT.BUTZ	They have a machine gunn dug in here pointing north.
HITLER	How did you survived this ordel? WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
PRVT.BUTZ	They let me go.
LT.ALDO	Now when you report what happened here, you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you told us. They'll shoot ya. But there gonna wanna know, why you so special, we let you live? So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you could spread the word through the ranks, what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.
HITLER	You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one word of detail! Your outfit was ambushed, and you got a away. Not one word more.
PVT.BUTZ	Yes mine Fuhrer.
HITLER	Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?
PVT.BUTZ	Yes mine Fuhrer.
HITLER	Remove your hat and show me.
LT.ALDO	Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the'war? When you get back home, what'eha gonna do?
PVT.BUTZ	I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her before.
LT.ALDO	Well, ain't that's a real nice boy. Are you going to take off your uniform?
PVT.BUTZ	Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to burn it! The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
LT. ALDO	Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't like that. You see, we like our Nazi's in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em, just like that. But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody gonna know you was a Nazi. And that don't sit well with us. Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.
LT.ALDO	So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin, you can't take off.
BACK TO HITLER	Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face, on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
SGT.DONOWITZ	You know Lieutenant, your getting pretty good at that.
LT. ALDO	You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't 'ch? Practice.
"GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"	NOTE: This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the
OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"	We hear the sound of the German musicals climax. The lights go up in the auditorium. Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside The MARQUEE READS in French: "GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO". A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
CU SHOSANNA	still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman, Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into
MADAME MIMIEUX	So young woman, since it's beyond obvious we're closed for the evening. I must assume you want something. What can I do for you?
SHOSANNA	May I sleep here tonight?
MADAME MIMIEUX	So I gather your not a nurse?
SHOSANNA	No.
MADAME MIMIEUX	But your a bright little thing, that's clever disguise. Where is your family?
SHOSANNA	Murdered.
MADAME MIMIEUX	So your a war orphan?
SHOSANNA	We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us
MADAME MIMIEUX	Is this a sad story?
SHOSANNA	Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX	Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in Paris has one. I haven't bore you with mine, don't bore me with yours.
SHOSANNA	You can run the machines?
MADAME MIMIEUX	What machines? Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
SHOSANNA	The machines that show the film?
MADAME MIMIEUX	The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema, of course I can operate them.
SHOSANNA	I know, I saw you.
CU SHOSANNA	eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
MADAME MIMIEUX	expertly working the projectors...
SHOSANNA	Teach me. Teach me to run the machines, that show the film. It's only you and the negro. I know you could use some help.
MADAME MIMIEUX	I know at least six people who've been put up against a wall, and machine gunned for sheltering enemies of the state. I have no intention of being unlucky number seven. How long have you been in Paris?
SHOSANNA	A week, and a few days.
MADAME MIMIEUX	How have you survived the curfew without capture?
SHOSANNA	I sleep on rooftops.
MADAME MIMIEUX	Again, I'm forced to admit, clever girl. How is it?
SHOSANNA	Cold. I can imagine.
SHOSANNA	Respectfully, no you can't.
MADAME MIMIEUX	Fair enough.
MADAME MIMIEUX	So you can't operate a 35mm film projector, you want me teach you, in order to work here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole to hide in, is that correct?
SHOSANNA	Oui.
MADAME MIMIEUX	Whats your name?
SHOSANNA	Shosanna.
MADAME MIMIEUX	I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a home for wayward war orphans. Having said that, what you say is true. If you were truly exceptional, I could find use for you. So Shosanna, are you truly exceptional?
SHOSANNA	Oui Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX	I will be the judge of that. Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS, The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,

SHOSANNA	THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from "GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
NARRATOR(VO)	To operate a cinema in Paris during the occupation, one had two choices. Ether you could show new German propaganda films, produced under the watchful eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you could have a German night in your weekly schedule, and show allowed German classic films. Their German night was Thursday. Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;
GERMAN SOLDIER	What starts tomorrow? Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up
SHOSANNA	A Max Linder festival.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin. Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Rid". The chase climax of "The Kid", superb. Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.
GERMAN SOLDIER	I suppose now you could use a "M" a "A" and a "X"?
SHOSANNA	No need, I can manage.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure. He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.
SHOSANNA	Merci.
GERMAN SOLDIER	I adore your cinema very much.
SHOSANNA	Merci. She busies herself with the marquee letters...
GERMAN SOLDIER	How does a young girl, such as yourself, own a cinema? Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts
SHOSANNA	My aunt left it to me.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Lucky girl. Shosanna makes no reply back.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Merci for hoisting a German night.
SHOSANNA	I don't have a choice, but your welcome.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Do you chose the German films yourself?
SHOSANNA	Oui.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Then my merci stands. I love the Refensthal mountain films, especially, "Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.
SHOSANNA	"Admire", would not be the adjective I would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal.
GERMAN SOLDIER	But you do admire the director. Pabst, don't you? That's why you included his name on the marquee. She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
SHOSANNA	I'm French. We respect directors in our country.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Apparently even Germans.
SHOSANNA	Even Germans. Merci for assistance, Private. Adieu. She turns to go back inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Your not finished?
SHOSANNA	I'll finish in the morning. She opens the door to go inside.
GERMAN SOLDIER	May I ask your name?
SHOSANNA	You wish to see my papers? She hands him her excellently forged papers. That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very pretty name.
SHOSANNA	Merci. Are you finished with my papers? He hands them back.
GERMAN SOLDIER	Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller. She gives no response.
GERMAN SOLDIER	It's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle. He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
FLASH ON	MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
MADAME MIMIEUX	if I ever see you light up a cigarette in my cinema again, I'll turn you into the Nazi's, do you understand? Shosanna is shocked by this statement.
SHOSANNA	Oui, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX	And for bringing a open flame in my cinema, you deserve far worse then a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is? Keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground, that's what! In my collection, I have over 350, 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not only immensely flammable, but highly unstable. And should they catch fire, they burn three times faster then paper. If that happens.. .POOF...all gone, cinema no more, every body burned alive. If I ever see you with a open flame in my cinema again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's I'll kill you myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a curfew pass. Do you understand me?
SHOSANNA	Out, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX	Do you believe me?
SHOSANNA	Out, Madame.
MADAME MIMIEUX	You damn well better.
BACK TO ROOF	Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke. Marcel comes onto the roof.
MARCEL	Are you well?
SHOSANNA	Even on the roof I can't smoke a cigarette without hearing Madames voice yelling at me. That's why I do it. To hear Madames voice again.
MARCEL	We both miss her.
SHOSANNA	I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be to bed soon. Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes. Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
FREDRICK	May I join you?
SHOSANNA	Look Fredrick - - You remember my name?
SHOSANNA	Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow -
FREDRICK	- Merci.
SHOSANNA	Your welcome. - regardless, I want you to stop pestering me.
FREDRICK	I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't trying to be a pest. I was simply trying to be friendly.
SHOSANNA	I don't wish to be your friend.
FREDRICK	Why not?
SHOSANNA	Don't act like a infant. You know why.
FREDRICK	I'm more then just a uniform.
SHOSANNA	Not to me. If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy? Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously Shosanna's eyes narrow.
SHOSANNA	Who are you?
FREDRICK	I thought I was just a uniform?
SHOSANNA	Your not just a German soldier, are you somebodies son?
FREDRICK	Most German soldiers are somebodies son.
SHOSANNA	Yeah, but your not just somebody. What are you, Hitlers nephew? He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;
FREDRICK	Yes.
SHOSANNA	Really?
FREDRICK	No not really, I'm just teasing you. She leans back annoyed.
SHOSANNA	Then what is it? What are you, a German movie star? 6'O
FREDRICK	Not exactly.
SHOSANNA	I asked if you were a movie star, the answer to that question, is yes or no. Fredrick laughs at that line.
FREDRICR	When you said that just now, you reminded me of my sister. This catches young Shosanna off guard.
FREDRICR	I come from a home of six sisters. We run a family operated cinema in Munich. Seeing you run around your cinema, reminds me of them. Especially my sister Helga. She raised me, when our father wasn't up to the job. I admire her very much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a German uniform.
SHOSANNA	You were raised by Helga?
FREDRICK	All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga was the bossiest.
SHOSANNA	And your mother and father?
FREDRICK	My mother died. And my father was a loser. My fathers moto; "If at first you don't succeed, quit". The day he left, good riddance. My sisters are all I need. It's why I like your cinema. It makes me feel both closer to them, and a little homesick at the same time.
SHOSANNA	is your cinema still operatiing?
FREDRICR	Oui.
SHOSANNA	What's it called?
FREDRICK	The Kino Haus.
SHOSANNA	How has it done durring the war?
FREDRICK	Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is up.
SHOSANNA	No doubt, you don't have to operate under a curfew.
FREDRICK	How often do you fill your house?
SHOSANNA	(Pfuit), not since before the war.
FREDRICK	So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out?
SHOSANNA	Of course, but that's not likely to happen. TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
SHOSANNA	So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?
FREDRICK	Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.
SHOSANNA	What did you do? He takes a sip of beer.
FREDRICK	I've shot the most enemy soldiers in world war two...so far. You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.
SHOSANNA	Wow.
FREDRICK	I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia. It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers.
SHOSANNA	What's a bird's nest?
FREDRICK	A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen.
SHOSANNA	How many Russian's did you kill?
FREDRICK	Sixty-eight. The first day. A hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two, the third day. On the forth day, they exited the city. Naturally my war story received alot of attention in Germany, that's why they all recognize me. They call me the German Sgt.York.
SHOSANNA	Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.
FREDRICK	Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's another reason for all the attention.
SHOSANNA	"Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's Pride" is starring you?
FREDRICK	I know, comical, huh?
SHOSANNA	Not so comical. So what are you doing in Paris, enjoying a rest?
FREDRICK	Hardly. I've been doing publicity, having my picture taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops, that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris, so I've been helping them in the planning. Joseph is very keen on this film. He's telling anybody who will listen, when "Nation's Pride" is released, I'll be the German Van Johnson. Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch. She abruptly rises, and says;
SHOSANNA	Well, good luck with your premier Private. I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself. Au revoir. And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private It's the next day. Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee. $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema. The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
GESTAPO MAJOR	Mademoiselle Nimieux?
SHOSANNA	Oui? Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;
GESTAPO MAJOR	Ask her if this is her cinema? in French The Driver asks Shosanna;
DRIVER	is this your cinema?
GESTAPO MAJOR	Tell her to come down.
DRIVER	Come down please. She climbs down the ladder. The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
SHOSANNA	I don't understand, what have I done?
DRIVER	She wants to know what she's done?
GESTAPO MAJOR	Who says she's done anything?
DRIVER	Who says you've done anything? Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.
SHOSANNA	Then I demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me? The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
GESTAPO MAJOR	Get your ass in that car. No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car, The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU	the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand. We join them in mid-conversation; They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;
GOEBBELS	- it's only the off spring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically. America olympic gold can measured in Negro sweat. Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
FREDRICK	Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or not you'd except my invitation.
SHOSANNA	Invitation? .Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;
GOEBBLES(OS)	Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick? Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
FREDRICK	Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet. Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
FREDRICK	Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I'm a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
GOEBBELS	Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux. He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big They all laugh. Fredrick jumps in...
FREDRICK	And normally, this is beer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.
FRANCESCA	looks up at Shosanna. NARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack;
NARRATOR (VO)	Francesca Mondino is much more then Goebbels French Interpreter. She's also Goebbels favorite French actress to appear in his films...
FILM CLIP	from one of Francesca's B/W Goebbels produced productions.
GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.	She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in to ENGLISH;
FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL	I love you, I can't help it. My country or my heart, which do I betray? A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the films title;
FLASH ON	Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red
NARRATOR (VO)	And Goebbels favorite French Mistress, to act in his bed. WE SEE JUST A SUPER QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!
BACK TO FRANCESCA	looking at Shosanna.
FRANCESCA	Bon jour.
SHOSANNA	Bon jour. f.
FREDRICK	And you've met the Major. The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;
GESTAPO MAJOR	Actually, I didn't introduce myself. Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at your service mademoiselle. Please allow me, have a seat. The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good. Goebbels looks across the table at her.
GOEBBELS	well I must say, you've made quite a impression on our boy. Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.
GOEBBELS	I must say fraulein, I should be rather annoyed with you. Francesca interprets..
GOEBBELS	I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star... Francesca interprets...
GOEBBELS	Little do I know Be's become the toast of paris, and now he must find time for me. Francesca interprets...
GOEBBELS	People wait in line hours, day's, to see me. For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait. Francesca interprets...
GOEBBELS	So finally, I'm granted a audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema. Francesca interprets...
GOEBBELS	So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business. Private Zoller interrupts -
FREDRICK	- Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed her yet.
GOEBBELS	Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema. Francesca, tell her. Francesca tells Shosanna in French;
FRANCESCA	What they're trying to tell you Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch, trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zollers film premier, and change the venue to your cinema. Zoller reacts. What?
FREDRICK	I wanted to inform her.
FRANCESCA	Shit. I apologize Private, of course you did. What's the issue?
FRANCESCA	The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.
GOEBBELS	Nonsense. Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform. Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Duly noted. Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;
GOEBBELS	You have opera boxes?
GOEBBELS	More would be better. How many seats in your auditorium?
SHOSANNA	Three hundred and fifty.
GOEBBELS	That's almost four hundred less then The Ritz. Fredrick jumps in...
FREDRICK	But beer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing. You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor. With less seat's it makes the event more exclusive. Your not trying to fill the house, their fightin g for seats. Besides, to hell with the French. This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration. This night is for you, me, the German military, the high command, their family and friends. The only people who should be allowed in the room, are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen. Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;
GOEBBELS	I see your public speaking has improved. It appears I've created a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When the war's over, politics awaits. Table chuckles.
GOEBBELS	Well Private, though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything. I must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before I can say, yes or no. So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening me. Francesca interprets...
GOEBBELS	What German films do you have? Francesca asks..
SHOSANNA	My cinema , on German night, tends to show older German classics. Francesca interprets...
GOEBBELS	Why not my films? Francesca asks... 6Z.
SHOSANNA	I draw a older German audience in my cinema, that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time. Francesca interprets...
GOEBBELS	That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans are looking forward, not backwards. That era of German cinema is dead. The German cinema I create, will not only be thee cinema of Europe. But the worlds only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of Hollywood. Fredrick Jumps in...
FREDRICK	Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic. He chuckles, but alone.
GOEBBELS	WSo it would appear. Unfortunately for the fraulein, I've outlawed film criticism. Zoller, thinking fast, says;
FREDRICK	Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"? I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it. And it's so funny, I've been meaning to recommend it to her, for her German night. That's a great idea, let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.
GOEBBELS	Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids". When all is said and done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not only that, I wouldn't be surprised, if sixty years from now, It's "Lucky Kids" that I'm the most remembered for. I know it doesn't seem like it now, but mark my words. Very well, I'll have a print sent over to the fraulein'.s cinema. We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight. As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna... ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
GOEBBELS	Ah Landa, your here, this is the young lady in question. The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
FREDRICK	Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of the SS., he'll be running security for the premier.
CU SHOSANNA	A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she The S.S. OFFICER that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
COL LANDA	Charmed Mademoiselle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Better known as "The Jew Hunter". The table laughs.
GOEBBELS	Oh Francesca, what was that funny thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?
FRANCESCA	What thing?
GOEBBELS	You know, you were there, it was a funny thing the Fuhrer said, about Hans...Something about a pig? Francesca's memory is jogged.
FRANCESCA	Oh, yes of course. She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.
GOEBBELS	Oh, yes of course, that's it. So the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be surprised if Hans weren't rooting out Jews like a truffle pig from the play pen.
FRANCESCA	That's what we need, pigs that can root out Jews.
COL LANDA	Who needs pigs when you have me? Big hearty laugh around the table.
GOEBBELS	Do you have a engagement tonight?
COL LANDA	Well, as a matter of fact, I do -
GOEBBELS	- Break it. We're all going to the Fraulein's cinema tonight to view "Lucky Kids".
COL LANDA	Splendid. Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,
FRANCESCA	And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment.
GOEBBELS	Slave driver! French slave driver! They all chuckle. Everybody begins to stand up from the table... ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs... .as Col Landa stands, he says;
COL LANDA	Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion, I'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.
C. 5.	Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.
FREDRICK	What sort of discussion?
COL LANDA	That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?
FREDRICK	Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel. Your authority is beyond question. But your reputation does proceed you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?
GOEBBELS	Hans, the boy means no harm, he's simply smitten. And he's correct. Your reputation does proceed you. Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
COL LANDA	No need for concern, you two. As security chief, I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner.
FREDRICK	I was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her cinema.
GOEBBELS	Nonsense! You can eat ice cream, and walk along the Sienne another time. Right now, allow Col Landa to do his job. Everybody saystheir farewells. Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;
COL LANDA	Have you tried the strudel here?
SHOSANNA	No.
COL LANDA	It's not so terrible. So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted? She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.
COL LANDA	Yes, two strudels, one for myself, and one for the mademoiselle. A cup of espresso, with a container of. steamed milk, on the side. For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk. Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
COL LANDA	So Mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain....? Up untill a couple of days ago, I had no knowledge of Private Zoller, or his exploits. To me, the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke a few times, but -
COL LANDA	- Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a simple formality, no reason for you to feel anxious. The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;
COL LANDA	I apologize, I forgot to order the cream fresh.
WAITER	One moment. He exits.
COL LANDA	Wait for the cream. So Emmanuelle - May I call you Emmanuelle?
SHOSANNA	Oui.
COL LANDA	So Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as your self, comes to own a cinema? The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
COL LANDA	After you. Shosanna takes Ã¢â¬Â¢a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her Success? Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves.
.COL LANDA	Like I said, not so terrible. So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership?
SHOSANNA	The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle - Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.
COL LANDA	- What is there names?
SHOSANNA	Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux. He records the names in his little book.
COL LANDA	Where are they now?
SHOSANNA	My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.
COL LANDA	Pity... . Continue.
SHOSANNA	Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.'
COL LANDA	Regrettable. It's come to my attention you have a negro in your employ, is that true?
SHOSANNA	Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema. He's the only other one who works with me.
COL LANDA	Doing what?
SHOSANNA	Projectionist.
COL LANDA	Is he any good?
SHOSANNA	The best.
COL LANDA	Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them. Can you operate the projectors?
SHOSANNA	Of course I can.
COL LANDA	Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening, dependent on the prowess of a negro. So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue, talented no doubt, as your negro may be, you will operate the projectors. Is that exceptable? As if she has any say.
SHOSANNA	Oui. Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.
COL LANDA	So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you?
SHOSANNA	Private Zollers feelings for me aren't of a romantic nature.
COL LANDA	Mademoiselle...?
SHOSANNA	Colonel, his feelings are not romantic. I remind him of his sister.
COL LANDA	That doesn't mean his feelings aren't romantic.
SHOSANNA	I remind him of his sister who raised him.
COL LANDA	It's sounding more and more romantic by the minute. Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
COL LANDA	Cigarette?
SHOSANNA	No thank you.
COL LANDA	Do you smoke?
SHOSANNA	Yes.
COL LANDA	Then I insist, you must take one. There not French, there German. I hope your not nationalist about your tobacco, to me French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine. She takes one, but makes no move to light it. He inhales deep, and says;
COL LANDA	I did have some thing else I wanted to ask you, but right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is. Oh well, must not of been important. Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
COL LANDA	Till tonight. And with that he's gone. Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief. The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself. The SILVER SCREEN on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".

NARRATOR (VO)	While Shosanna sits there pretending to be amused by the aryan antics of Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky Kids", a thought suddenly comes to her. We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.
NARRATOR (VO)	What if tonight, accidently, the cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose it's Minister of propaganda, it's national hero, and it's top jew hunter, all in one fell swoop. She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's

NARRATOR(VO)	The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a complete success. And Heer Goebbels conceded to have the venue changed to Shosannas cinema. Not only that, in a moment of inspiration, Heer Goebbels had a idea. Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;
GOEBBELS	I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium. Your Cinema has real respect, almost church like. Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit. In Versailles there's a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary. we're going to get it, and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof. Also I want to go to Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and just scatter them about the lobby.
MONTAGE	we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening. The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography. We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
SHOSANNA	watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
NARRATOR (VO)	As they left the little French cinema that night, all the Germans were very happy... We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he.can say goodbye.
NARRATOR (VO)	None more so then Private Zoller. She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the The Nazi's are gone. Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;
MARCEL	What the fuck are we suppose to do?
SHOSANNA	It looks like we're suppose to have a Nazi premier.
MARCEL	Like I said, what the fuck are we suppose to do?
SHOSANNA	Well, I need to speak with you about that.
MARCEL	About what?
SHOSANNA	About these Hun swine, commandeering our cinema. What about it? She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
SHOSANNA	Well, when I was watching the bosch Capra-corn abomination, I got a idea.
MARCEL	I'm confused, what are we talking about?
SHOSANNA	Filling the cinema with Nazi's and their whores, and burning it down to the ground.
MARCEL	I'm not talking about that, your talking about that.
SHOSANNA	No, we're talking about that, right now. If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it down by ourselves.
MARCEL	Shosanna -
SHOSANNA	No, Marcel, just for sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema, for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no?
MARCEL	Oui Shosanna, we could do that.
SHOSANNA	And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection, we wouldn't even need explosives, would we?
MARCEL	You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?
SHOSANNA	Oui, that's exactly what I mean. She begins kissing his hands. I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night. One of his fingers probes her mouth. And if I'm going to burn down the cinema, which I am, we both know, your not going to let me do it by myself. The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand Because you love me. And I love you. And your the only person on this earth I can trust. She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now, But that's not all we're going to do. Does the filmmaking equipment it the attic still work? I know the film camera does. How about the sound recorder?
MARCEL	Quite well, actually. I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week. It works superb. Why do we need filmmaking equipment?
SHOSANNA	Because Marcel, my sweet, we're going to make a film. Just for the Nazi's.
MILITARY ATTACHE	Right this way, Lieutenant. A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked. But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
LT. HICOX	Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.
GEN FENECH	General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox. Drink? Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
LT.HICOX	if you offered me a scotch and plane water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
GEN.FENECH	That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like a good chap, will you? Bars in the globe. Hicox heads over to the bar globe.
LT.HICOX	Something for yourself, sir?
GEN.FENECH	Whiskey straight. No junk in it. The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and
GEN.FENECH	It says here you've run three undercover commando operations in Germany, and German occupied territories? Frankfaurt, Holland, and Norway to be exact? Back to them, mixing drinks, he says;
LT.HICOX	Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.
GEN.FENECH	It says here you speak German fluently?
LT.HICOX	Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
GEN.FENECH	And your occupation before the war? His back still to us, as he bartends...
LT. H I COX	I'm a film critic.
GEN.FENECH	List your accomplishments?
LT.HICOX	Well sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles, for a publication called; "Films and Filmmakers". As well as our sister publication.
GEN.FENECH	What's that called?
LT.HICOX	"Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had two books published.
GEN.FENECH	Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant, what are their titles?
LT. HI COX	The first book was called; "Art Of The Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study of German Cinema in the Twenties". And the second one was called; ... He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the
LT.HICOX	"Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci". It's a subtexual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.
LT. HI COX	What should we drink to, sir?
GEN.FENECH	Down with Hitler.
LT.HICOX	All the way down, sir.
GEN.FENECH	Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
LT. HI COX	Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I am familiar with it.
GEN.FENECH	Explain it to me.?
LT.HICOX	Pardon sir?
GEN.FENECH	This little escapade of ours, requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?
LT.HICOX	Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema. A alternative to what he considers the Jewish German intellectual cinema of the twenties. And the Jewish controlled dogma of Hollywood. SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;
CHURCHELL	How's he doing?
LT. H I COX	Frightfully sorry sir, once again?
CHURCHELL	You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game? Compared to say .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?
LT.HICOX	Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite number. I believe Goebbels see's himself closer to David O.Selznick. Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister. With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;
CHURCHELL	Brief him.
GEM.FENECH	Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd like to brief you on, Operation Kino. Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premier of one of his new movies in Paris -
LT.HICOX	- What film sir? The General has to resort to peeking at his file.
GEN.FENECH	The motion pictures called; "Nation's Pride".
LT.HICOX	Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?
GEN.FENECH	We don't have any intelligence, on exactly, what the film that night will be about.
LT.HICOX	But it's called "Nation's Pride"?
GEN.FENECH	Yes.
LT.HICOX	I can tell you what it's about, it's about Private Fredrick Zoller. He's the German Sgt.York. Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.
GEN.FENECH	In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring, Boorman, and most of the German High command, including all high ranking officers of both The S.S., and, The Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
LT.HICOX	The master race at play, aye?
GEN.FENECH	Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.
LT.HICOX	"...and like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.
GEN.FENECH	An American Secret Service outfit, that lives deep behind enemy lines, will be your assist. The Germans call them; "The Basterds".
LT.HICOX	"The Basterds", never heard of them.
GEN.FENECH	Whole point of the secret service, old boy, you not hearing of them. But the Gerrys have heard of them, because these yanks have been them the devil. Their leader is a chap named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans call him, "Aldo the Apache".
LT.HICOX	Why do they call him that?
GEN.FENECH	Best guess, is because he removes the scalps of the Nazi dead.
LT.HICOX	Scalps, sir?
GEN.FENECH	The hair. He runs his finger along his hairline.
GEN.FENECH	Like a red Injun.
LT.HICOX	Rather gruesome sounding little Dicky bird, isn't he?
GEN.FENECH	No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a nutters. But you've heard the expression, "It takes a thief".
LT.HICOX	Indeed. General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
GEN.FENECH	You'll be dropped into France, about twenty four kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a little village called, "Nadine". Apparently the Gerrys never go there. In Nadine, there's a tavern, called, "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous with our double agent, and she'll take it from there. She's the one who's going to get you in the premiere. It will be you, her, and two German born members of the Basterds. She's also made all the other arrangements your going to need.
LT.HICOX	How will I know her?
GEN.FENECH	I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you. Your contact is Bridget Von Hammersmark.
LT.HICOX	Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German movie star is working for England?
GEN.FENECH	For the last two years now. one could even say Operation Kino was her brainchild. In the back of the room the bulldog barks;
CHURCHELL	Extraordinary women.
LT.BICOX	Quite.
GEN.FENECH	You'll go to the premiere as her escort, lucky devil. She'll also have the premiere tickets for the other two. Got the gist?
LT.HICOX	I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles. The three British bulldogs laugh. Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema, Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA, Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame. SUBTITLED into you know what.
MARCEL	We need a sync mark.
SHOSANNA	What is a sync mark?
MARCEL	A action and noise put together, So we can sync up the picture and sound.
SHOSANNA	How do we do that?
MARCEL	Clap your hands. She does.
MARCEL	In frame imbecile. She claps her hands in front of her face.
MARCEL	Ready? Shosanna takes a deep breath, then;
SHOSANNA	Ready.
MARCEL	Action.
MARCEL	But how do we get it developed? Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage. How do we get a35mm print with a soundtrack?
SHOSANNA	Do you know one person who can do both things?
MARCEL	Of course Gaspar, very nice man, took care of all the experimental filmmakers. But nobody in their right mind would strike a print of what your talking about. If the Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't be worth this. He snaps his fingers.
SHOSANNA	In a wolf fight, you ether eat the wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're going to obliterate the Nazi's, we have to use their tactics.
MARCEL	What does that mean?
SHOSANNA	We find somebody who can develop and process a35mm print. And we make them do it, or we kill them. Once we tell them what we want to do, if they refuse, we have to kill them anyway, or they'll turn us in.
MARCEL	Would you do that?
SHOSANNA	Like that. Snaps her fingers. ?S, GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
SHOSANNA	Bring that fucker over here! Put his head down on that table. Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
SHOSANNA	You ether do what the fuck we tell you to, or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull.
GASPAR	I'm not a collaborator!
SHOSANNA	Then prove it! Or does your manhood go no deeper, then standing to piss? Marcel, does his wife, and children know you?
MARCEL	Oui.
SHOSANNA	Then after we kill this dog for Germans, we'll go and silence them. She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...
SHOSANNA	Prepare to die, collaborator fucker! hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm FILM. Outside WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers The can for REEL 4is open and empty. Shosanna's at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out "The Village of TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
LT.ALDO	You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous was in a fuckin basement.
LT.HICOX	I didn't know.
LT.ALDO	You said it was in a tavern?
LT.HICOX	it is a tavern.
LT.ALDO	Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin in a basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being, your fighting in a basement. Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
WICKI	What if we go in there, and she's not even there?
LT.HICOX	We wait. Don't worry, she's a British spy, she'll make the rendez-vous. WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of .Stiglitz is fucking werid... Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...
LT.NICOX	Stiglitz, right?
STIGLITZ	That's right, sir. He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
LT.HICOX	I hear your pretty good with that? Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.
LT.HICOX	You know, we're not looking for trouble, right now. We're simply making contact with our agent. Should be uneventful. However, on the off chance I'm wrong, and things prove eventful. I need to know, we can all remain calm. The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
STIGLITZ	I don't look calm to you?
LT.HICOX	Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do. He turns his attention back to his blade. Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;
LT. HI COX	This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz? Not exactly the loquacious type, is he? Aldo just looks at him.
LT.ALDO	Is that the kinds man you need, the loquacious type?
LT.HICOX	Fair point, Lieutenant.
LT.ALDO	So y'all git in trouble in there, what are we suppose to do? Make bets on how it all comes out?
LT.HICOX	If we get into trouble, we can handle it. But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for matter, escape from that basement. If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
SGT.DONOWITZ	Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark, who's idea was it for the death trap redez-vous?
LT.HICOX	She chose the spot.
SGT.DONOWITZ	Well isn't that just dandy?
LT.HICOX	Look, she's not a military strategist. She's just a actress.
LT.ALDO	Ya don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
LT.HICOX	She wasn't picking a place to fight. She was picking a place, isolated, and without germans.
PFC.HIRSCHBERG	Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary, but I got me a Nazi pissin on Louisianna two-o'clock. They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
LT.HICOX	Shit. Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

EDGAR WALLACE	Well, not really.
SGT.POLA NEGRI	What do you mean, not really? Of course he is.
EDGAR WALLACE	Well if he's so American, how come he's never been translated into English? He's not American. He's suppose to be American, but he's not a American creation. In fact, he's something very different.
WINNETOU	Okay, I'm a fictional, literary character, from the past, I'm American, and that's controversial.
BRIDGET/GENGUS	No it's not controversial. The nationally of the author, has nothing to do with the nationally of the character. The Character is the character. Hamlet's not British, he's Danish. So yes, this character was born in America.
WINNETOU	Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had a wife, would she be called a squaw? He's got it. The table Laughs. The TABLE

BRIDGET	Really? No, I wasn't aware of that at all.
MATA HARI	They must be second nature to you now? Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies?
BRIDGET	Well, yes they did, but it's not really that difficult.
SGT.POLA NEGRI	Do one for us. The Tableheartily agrees. Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect, The Table loves it.

BRIDGET	Normally that's true. The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby. His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate.
WICXI	We should leave.
BRIDGET	F No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink.
LT.HICOX	She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze.
BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE	The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
NAPOLEON.	The Germans all laugh.
BRIDGET	There's been some new developments. The cinema venue has changed.
LT.HICOX	Why?
BRIDGET	No one knows. But that in itself shouldn't be a problem. The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here. Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react. The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow. Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE. Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS	They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
BRIDGET	You'll be going as Ernst Schuller. You'll say your a associate producer on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the one German production not under Goebbels control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair.

SGT.POLA NEGRI	Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday?
BRIDGET	I'd love to Wilhelm. This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today. The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
SGT.POLA NEGRI	Thank you, heil Hitler. He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..
BRIDGET	So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet?
SGT.POLA NEGRI	I most certainly do, fraulein. His name is Maximilian. Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.
STIGLITZ	Wonderful name, Sgt.
SGT.POLA NEGRI	Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy him a blue one. And I will paint on the side "The Blue Max". He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers. Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.
BRIDGET	There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet. She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
BRIDGET	Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.
SGT.POLA NEGRI	Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may not know who you are now. But he will. I will show him all of your movies. He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall. Then, to the whole tavern...
SGT.POLA NEGRI	I purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark! The whole room toasts. This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
SGT.POLA NEGRI	So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France? Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
LT.HICOX	None of your business,Sgt. You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me. The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.
LT.HICOX	Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted man. This is a officers table. I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table. The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.
SGT.POLA NEGRI	Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is is very unusual. The whole room pauses-for different reasons...

The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola... A GERMAN VOICE rings out; Then might I inquire? The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Like the young newly christened father, I too have a acute ear for accents. And like him, I too find yours odd. From where do you hail, Cap't? Wicki jumps in;
WICKI	Major, this is highly inappr -
MAJOR HELLSTROM	T wasn't speaking to you Lt.Saltzberg, or you ether, Lt.Berlin. I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what. The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.
LT.HICOX	I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	The mountain?
LT.HICOX	Yes. In that village we all speak like this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Yes. f q s
LT. HICOX	Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch scene?
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Yes I do.
LT.HICOX	In that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a Close Up. As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
BRIDGET	Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said. He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome then he. The impostors laugh. Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	You should rejoin your friends. Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
MAJOR HELLSTROM	May I join you?
BRIDGET	By all means, Major. The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
MAJOR HELLSTROM	So that's the source of your bazaar accent? Extraordinary. So what are you doing here Cap't?
LT.HICOX	Aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein?
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Well that pleasure requires no explanation. Chuckle...Chuckle
MAJOR HELLSTROM	I mean in country. Your obviously not stationed in France, or I'd know who you are.
LT Ã¢â¬Â¢ I'! I COX	You know every German in France?
MAJOR BELLSTROM	Worth knowing.
LT.HICOX	Well, there in lies the problem. We never claimed to be worth knowing. Chuckle... Chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	All levity aside, what are you doing in France?
LT.HICOX	Attending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Your the frauleins escort?
LT.HICOX	Somebody has to carry the lighter. Chuckle chuckle.
BRIDGET	The Captain is my date, but all three are my guests. We're old friends Major, who go back along time. Longer then a actress would care to admit. Chuckle chuckle.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room.
BRIDGET	I'll drink to that. They cheers.
BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE	They continue to have alot of fun playing their game.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	I must say, that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't join them, because your quite right Cap't, officers and enlisted men shouldn't fraternize. But seeing as we're all officers here, .and sophisticated lady friends of officers. What say we play the game? Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
BRIDGET	okay, one game.
WUNDERBAR	The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
MAJOR HELLSTROM	So the object of the game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu. Eric' More pens. And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's. When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to the person to your left. The person to your right, will move their card in front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so. He demonstrates. )oz. And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are... As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	.So let's give it a try, shall we? Everybody write your names. The Five players write their names... Then move their cards to the right... Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...
HELLSTROMVON HAMMERSMARKWICKIHICOXSTIGLITZ	is is is is is
MAJ.KING KONG	I'll start, give you the idea. Am I German? They laugh.
BRIDGET	No.
MAJ.KING KONG	Am I a American? They laugh - but then Wicki says;
WICKI	Wait a minute, he goes to
BRIDGET	Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America.
MAJ.KING KONG	So... . I visited America, aye? The Table says; "Yes".
MAJ.KING KONG	Was this vist...fortuitous?
WICKI	Not for you.
MAJ.KING KONG	.Bummm. My native land, is it what one would call, exotic? The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.
MAJ.KING KONG	Hummmm. That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle? The Tablesays; "Yes you are".
MAJ.KING KONG	Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask, weather your real or fictitious. I however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle? I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle to America,... .Did I go by boat? "Yes".
MAJ.KING KONG	Did I go against my will? "Yes".
MAJ.KING KONG	On this boat ride, ... . Was I in chains?
MAJ.KING KONG	When I arrived in America,...Was I displayed in chains? "Yes".
MAJ.KING KONG	Am I the story of the Negro in America? The Table says, "No".
MAJ.KING KONG	Well then I must be King Kong. Be throws the card on the table. They applaud him.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Nov since I answered correctly, you all need to finnish your drinks. The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Now, who's next?
LT.HICOX	Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while. So... Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a intruder. How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?
BRIDGET	Of course not, Major.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	I didn't think so. It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms. The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation?
MAJOR HELLSTROM	I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu. Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish highlands. What do you say gentlemen?
LT.HICOX	Your most gracious, sir.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses! You don't want to contaminate the thirty- three with the swill you were drinking.
ERIC	How many glasses?
LT.HICOX	Five glasses.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.
BRIDGET	Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly. Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the
LT.HICOX	Three glasses. Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;
MAJOR HELLSTROM	To a thousand year Reich! They all mutter, "a thousand year reich", and toast glasses.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Did you hear that? That's the sound of my Luger pointed right at your testicles.
LT.HICOX	Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles?
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Because you've just given yourself away, Cap't. Your no more German then that scotch.
LT.HICOX	Well, -Major -
BRIDGET	- Major -
MAJOR HELLSTROM	- Shut up slut. You were saying?
LT.HICOX	I was saying that makes two of us. I've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.
SGT.STIGLITZ	That makes three of us.
UNDERTABLE	We See all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches. As well
SGT.STIGLITZ	And at this range, I'm a real Fredrick Zoller. Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Hummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here.
LT. H ICOX	What's going to happen, Major, is your going to stand up, and walk out that door with us.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	No no no no no no, I don't think so. I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter what happens to anybody else in this room, the two of us aren't going anywhere.
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Too bad about them though. They seem like a likeable You two will have to shoot them.
BRIDGET	Then Major, i implore you. For the sake of those German troops, will you please leave with us?
MAJOR HELLSTROM	Oh Bridget, your concern for German troops, gets me .right here. You mean for the sake your whore legs, don't you? You can't afford to get any bullet holes in them, your not finished spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews. Lt.Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt 'Well, if this is it old boy, I hope you dont mind if I go out speaking the kings? By all means, Cap't. The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three
LT.HICOX	There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch. And seeing as I might be rapping on the door momentarily... He downs the stuff.
LT.HICOX	I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
LT.HICOX	Now about this, "Pickle", we find ourself's in. It would appear, there's only thing left for you to do. And what would that be?
LT.HICOX	Stiglitz.
STIGLITZ	Say, auf wiedersehen to your balls!
STIGLITZ	FIRES into HELLSTROM'S BALLS... As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
HELLSTROM	FIRES into HICOX'S BALLS and KNEE CAPS.

WILHELM	They attacked us! Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive on our side?
WILHELM	No! We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out;
BRIDGET'S VOICE(OS)	I'm alive! Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice. On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	Who's that?
WILHELM	Make a sound whore, and I spit! Meaning the muzzle.
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	Wilhelm, who is that?
WILHELM	is the girl on your side? Pause. Which girl?
WILHELM	1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark!
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	Yeah, she's oar's!
WILHELM	I thought so. So you run with the American's now, huh? Now times are bad?
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	Is she okay?
WILHELM	You despicable traitor. She's been shot, but she's alive. For now. We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen.
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we make a deal?
WILHELM	What's your name?
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap Willi?
WILHELM	Yes. So Willi, you know we could lob three or four or five or six grenades down there, and your little war story ends here. But good fer you, bad fer her, you die, she dies. So what say we make a swap?
WILLI	Keep talking? Okay, Willi here's my deal! You let me and one of my men come down to take the girl away! And we take the girl, and leave! That simple, Willi! You go your way, we go ours! And little Max, gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we got a deal? Willi thinks... Bridget watches Willi think...
WILLI	Aldo?
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	I'm here Willi!
WILLI	I want to trust you.... But howcanI? What choice ya got?
WILLI	I could kill the girl!
ALDO'S VOICE(OS)	Well now, Willi, that's true enough. But something you need to know, so you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't none of us give a fuck bout that girl. But, admittedly, if you kill her, it would fuck up our plans. But you'll be dead by then anyway, so what'd you care? And lets not forget that little gatzenjammer Max, growin up without a pop. So in the spirit of gettin you home to him, we got a deal, Willi?
WILLI	Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you! Come down, no guns! Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands. Aldo with his hands up, says; Hey Willi, what's with the machine gunny I thought we had a deal?
WILLI	We do have a deal, now git the girl and go.
ALDO	Not so fast, Willi, we only have a deal, we trust each other. A Mexican stand off ain't trust. a Mexican stand off.
ALDO	you got guns on us, you decide to shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got grenades, they drop 'em down here, your dead. That's a Mexican stand off, and that wasn't the deal.
WILLI	Just take that fucking traitor, and go! See? Now your down here Now you get tricky - t
ALDO	- No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm too damn dumb toget tricky. But him and I lived upto the deal. We came down without guns. Now it's your turn. No trust,no deal. Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking...
ALDO	i know your scarred. I'm scarred, he's scarred, we're all scarred. So what's it gonnabe Willi? Ether we got a deal, or you might as well just shoot us now. Willi decides... He puts the machine gunn down on the bar.
WILLI	Fine. Take that fucking traitor and get her out of my sight.
ALDO	Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg, you grab her shoulder - From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major
ALDO	You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with that man! From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain
BRIDGET	He was a enemy soldier, who knew who I was. He couldn't live. Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor,
HIRSCHBERG	I ought'a beat your fuckin head in
ALDO	Stop it. Just pick her up, and get that bitch outta here.
HIRSCHBERG	Aldo, she just-
ALDO	- She's right.
HIRSCHBERG	What?
ALDO	I said, she's right. He was a Nazi soldier. If he lived, he would doomed the mission. )Is,. Don't mean I like it, don't mean I like her, but she's right. Now as Willi said, "take this fuckin traitor, and get 'er outta my sight". Hirschberg, carrying Fraulein Von Hammersmark, and Aldo emerge Bridget points at a fancy black sedan, telling them it's her's. OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN... Doctor? Doctor? What? What's happening? head, shocking, Donny SLAMS the 45. hard against the Old Man's Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor? He nods his head, yes.
SGT.DONOWITZ	Andi amo... Donny YANKS/DRAGS the Old Man out of bed, in his almost .Into a doctors examining room, built into a French country of a veterinarian. Along the walls are different cages with eight excited BARKING The Soldiers are putting the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in She's been shot. Shot. Bang bang... .in leg...understand? No no no, I don't speak English. Donny jams the barrel of his 45. into the thigh of the Old Man. BANG BANG - in the leg, understand! The Old Man nods his head yes. But I'm a veterinarian ...animals... I take care of animals... Bridget screams from the table... He's a fucking veterinarian you imbecile! It's still a doctor. If he can get a bullet out of a cow, he can get a bullet outta you.
LT.ALDO	Right now, we just need morphine. Donny yells at the Old Man;
SGT.DONOWITZ	Morphine! We need morphine! The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human ..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the Everybody jumps. Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man; He SHOOTS another dog...
MOREPHINE!!!	The Old Man begs him to stop, and goes to get the morphine. The BODY of Gestapo Major DEITER HELLSTROM dead on the floor. Were back in the basement tavern. Colonel Hans Landa stands He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;
COL.LANDA	Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the world I see. Lieutenant. And with your record of insubordination. Truly remarkable. A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN, joins the S.S. Officer.
COL.LANDA	And that ones... .name is Weiheim Wicki. Bets Austrian born jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites. They are the two German born members of The Basterds. They've been known to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.
FLASH ON	Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German
SGT.GERMAN COMPANY	What brings you all the way out here? The TRIO MOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine gunns.
COL LANDA	But that doesnt look like this. This is odd. Looking down he see's something... .bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two One shoe is covered in blood. The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean.
COL.LANDA	It would appear somebodies missing. Somebody fashionable. A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out;
SOLDIERS VOICE(OS)	Col, this ones still alive! We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies. Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
LT.ALDO	Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need to answer a few questions
BRIDGET	Few questions about what?
LT.ALDO	About I got three men dead back there, and why don't you try tellin us what the fuck happened?
BRIDGET	The British officer blew his German act, and a Gestapo Major saw it.
LT.ALDO	'fore we get into who shot John, why did you invite my men to a rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
BRIDGET	I can see, since you didn't see what happened inside, the Nazi's being there must look odd.
LT.ALDO	Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda odd in English, it's called, suspicious.
BRI DGET	Don't let your imagination get the better of you, Lieutenant. You met the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His commanding officer gave him and his friends the night off to celebrate. The Germans being there was just a tragic coincidence. Aldo thinks for a moment...
LT. ALDO	Okay, I'll buy that. He was ether there with his men waiting for us, or he was there celebrating his sons birthday, he wasn't doin both.
LT.ALDO	How did the shootin start?
BRIDGET	The English man, gave himself away.
LT. ALDO	How did he do that?
BRIDGET	He ordered three glasses. She holds up three fingers, index to pinky.
BRIDGET	We order, three glasses. She holds up three fingers, thumb to index.
BRIDGET	That's the German three. The other is odd. Germans would, and did notice it.
LT. ALDO	Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans, and everything went exactly the way it was suppose to. What would of been the next step?
BRIDGET	Tuxedos. To get them into the premiere, wearing military uniforms, with all the military there, would of been suicide. But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos, and blend in with everybody else. I arranged a tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
LT.ALDO	How did you intend to get them into the premiere?
BRIDGET	Hand me my purse. They do. And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the
BRIDGET	Lt.Hicox was going as my escort. The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
LT. ALDO	Can you still get us in that premiere?
BRIDGET	Can you speak German better then your friends, no. Have I been shot, yes. I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up the red carpet any time soon. Least of all by tomorrow night. However, there's something you don't know. There's been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino. One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz, to a much smaller venue.
LT.ALDO	Enormous changes at the last minute? That's not very Germatic. Why the hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn peculiar?
BRIDGET	It probably has something to do with the second development.
LT. ALDO	Which is?
FLASH ON	IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY, The FUHRER, aka Adolph I've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nations Pride". As the weeks have gone on, and the Americans are on the beach, I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous for us. And I'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful.
BRIDGET	The Fuhrer's attending the premiere. Donny breaks the teams silence;
SGT.DONOWITZ	What?
LT.ALDO	When the hell did this happen?
BRIDGET	The venue change, two weeks ago. The Fuhrer's attendance, four days ago.
LT. ALDO	And how come London don't know nothing about that?
BRIDGET	We need to get something straight, once and for all. Everything London knows, it learned from me. If I don't know, London doesn't know. So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler's coming to Paris.
FUCK A DUCK?	Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
BRIDGET	What are you thinking?
LT.ALDO	I'm thinking getting a wack at plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes this a horse of a different color.
BRIDGET	What's that suppose to mean?
LT.ALDO	It means, your gettin us in that premiere.
BRIDGET	I'm going to probably end up losing this leg, bye bye acting career, fun while it lasted. How do you expect me to walk up a red carpet? The doggie docs gonna dig that slug outta your gam. Then he's gonna wrap it up in a cast, and you gotta good how I broke my leg mountain climbing story. That's German, ain't it? Y'all like climbin mountains, don'tch?
BRIDGET	I don't. I like smoking, drinking, and ordering in restaurants, but I see your point.
LT. ALDO	We fill ya up with morphine, till it's comin out ya ears. Then just limp your little ass up that rouge car-pet.
BRIDGET	Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up against a wall, it won't hurt so much. I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you American's speak any other language then English?
HIRSCHBERG	Other then Yiddish?
BRIDGET	Preferably. Donny referring to Aldo and himself.
SGT.DONOWITZ	We both speak alittle Italian.
BRIDGET	With a atrocious accent, no doubt. But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib. Germans don't have a good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian, and brazen through it, is that the plan?
LT. ALDO	That's about it.
BRIDGET	That sounds good.
LT. ALDO	it sounds like shit, but what else we gonna do, go home?
BRIDGET	No, it's good. If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building. So, who does what?
LT.ALDO	Well I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks the second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg third most, so he'll be Donnys assistant.
HIRSCHBERG	I don't speak Italian.
LT. ALDO	Like I said, third best. Just keep your fuckin mouth shut. In fact why don't you start practising, right now.
BRIDGET	What about the little one?
UTIVICH	Do you mean me?
BRIDGET	I didn't mean any offence.
UTIVICH	None taken you German cunt.
LT.ALDO	Utivich is the chauffeur.
UTIVICH	I can't drive. Bridget SCREAMS in frustration;
BRIDGET	You Americans are fucking useless!
UTIVICH	IVGimmie a break, I'm from Manhattan.
LT.ALDO	No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours before the movie tomorrow. More then enough time for you to learn to drive.
UTIVICH	NO no no no, Lieutenant, it's not!
LT.ALDO	Oh yes yes yes yes, Private, it is. And yes yes yes yes, you will. Look Utivich, you and I both know, if we went to grade school together, you damn sure ain't copyin off of my test. Well I lern't to drive in four hours on a Tennessee mountain road. And I'm a shit for brains coal miner bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how to drive, right?
HIRSCHBERG	Yes.
LT.ALDO	Teach 'em.
BRIDGET	But there is a problem. I'm a movie star. This is a movie premiere. I can't show up looking like I was just in a Nazi gun fight. Now I have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But sometime tomorrow, I have to get my hair done. All The Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.
LT. ALDO	Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who went to beauty school? The CAMERA WHIP PANS to SGT.DONOWITZ. Bridget rolls her eyes. She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it. Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very The stairwell in the building that connects the living Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;
MARCEL	Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.
SHOSANNA	Shut up fool. Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips
SHOSANNA	Cheeky black bugger. I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs. Let's go over it again?
MARCEL	Reel one is on the first projector. Reel two is on the second. Three and four are ready to go.
SHOSANNA	Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel. Our film, comes on in the forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and lock the doors of the auditorium. Then take your place behind the screen, and wait for my CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN! The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
CAMERA FRAME	directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
THEN...	.A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
THINK BUBBLE	Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
COL.LANDA	I want everybody out of this room! They start to leave.
COL.LANDA	That means now, goddamnit! They RUSH OUT. He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
COL.LANDA	Can you speak, Sgt? L - )1. Yes Colonel.
COL.LANDA	Tell me everything that happened in there? The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
CU COL.LANDA	smiles. He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs...
COL.LANDA	Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what has befallen Germany's most elegant swan?
BRIDGET	Colonel Landa, it's been years. Dashing as ever I see.
COL.LANDA	Flattery will get you everywhere, fraulein. They chuckle, and air kiss.
COL.LANDA	So what's happened to your lovely leg, a by product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt.
BRIDGET	Save your flattery, you old dog. I know too many of your former conquests, to fall into that honey pot. Chuckle-chuckle...
COL.LANDA	Seriously, what happened?
BRIDGET	Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I might add, at mountain climbing. And this was the result.
COL.LANDA	Mountain climbing? That's how you injured your leg, mountain climbing?
BRIDGET	Believe it or not, yes it is. A brief moment passes between the two... The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
COL.LANDA	Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean laugh at your misfortune. It's just .mountain climbing? I'm curious fraulein, what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor? The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.
BRIDGET	Well, I chant be doing it again, I can tell you that.
COL.LANDA	That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing this mountain, last night?
BRIDGET	Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday morning.
COL.LANDA	Hummm. And where exactly in Paris is this mountain? This stops her for a seconded. Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.
COL.LANDA	I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You know me, I tease rough. So who are your three handsome escorts?
BRIDGET	I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German. Their friends of mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti. A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi. And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco. The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col. Sans Landa of the S.S. The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
COL.LANDA	Margheriti...? Am I saying it correctly...? .Margheriti? Yes. Correct. Margheriti.... Say it for me once please...?
LT. ALDO	Margheriti. 13ZÃ¢â¬Â¢ I'm sorry, again...?
LT.ALDO	I4argheriti. Once more... .?
LT.ALDO	Margheriti.
COL.LANDA	Nargheriti. It means daisies, I believe. Turning his gaze to Donny. What's your name again?
SGT.DONOWITZ	Enzo Gorlomi. Again... .?
SGT.DONOWITZ	Gorlomi. One more time, but let me really hear the music in it. Gorlomi. Now to Hirschberg... And you? Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the
HIRSCHBERG	Dominick Decocco.
COL.LANDA	Dominick Decocco?
HIRSCHBERG	Dominick Decocco.
COL.LANDA	Bravo... . Bravo. Well, my two cameraman friends need to find there seats. Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses. Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne. Everyone gets a glass. - Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please join us, I have some friends I'd like you to meet. Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass. May I say Mademoiselle, you look divine. Merci'. This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux, this is her cinema, and she is our hostess for the evening. And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and none worse for the wear German goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark.
BRIDGET	Bonjour.
SHOSANNA	Bon jour. I'm afraid my companions don't speak any French, there Italian. This is Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick. All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles. Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks Italian associates, need help finding there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind to escort them? It would be my pleasure. Let me see your tickets? Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her. The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats. .reaches out and grabs her wrist. He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt,
HIRSCHBERG	Grazie.
13r.	The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
SHOSANNA	Prego.
BACK TO LOBBY	They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
GERMAN SOLDIER	Take your seats! The show is about to begin! Everybody take your seatsl Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together. I must call The Fuhrer. He doesn't want to make his entrance untill everybody seated. Come with me Frau Von Hammersmark. The Fuhrer has heard your here, and he wishes to commend you personally. Me? Why? Don't be modest. Everybody is quite taken with your resolve. A accident, like you've just experienced, and yet you still show up to to a important Party event. The Fuhrer was quite adamant in his gratitude. We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office. I'm afraid I must rob you of your companion, but only for a moment. Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes to commend me. Wait here a moment. I promise I won't detain her long. What are ether of them suppose to do, argue? Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and They both enter. Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT. Now the two Germans are alone.
COL.LANDA	Have a seat fraulein. Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk. Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk, He sits. Their knees almost touching. The colonel points to the foot not in the cast. Let me see your foot. I beg your pardon? Patting his lap.
COL.LANDA	Put your foot in my lap.
BRIDGET	Colonel, you embarrass me.
COL.LANDA	I assure you fraulein, my intention is not to flirt. Patting his lap more with more aggression. The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that .He removes the shoe... .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot... He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe He slips it on her foot... .it fits like a glove. Bridget knows she's BUSTED. Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;
COL.LANDA	What's that American expression... "if the shoe fits...you must wear it". He removes her foot from his lap. What now Colonel? Do you admit you treachery? She stares defiant daggers into him. The only thing I will admit to, is resisting you... Sons-a-bitches.. .to my last breath. "Resist to your last breath"? Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF
BANG?	She's dead. He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are
TREMBLING...	He rises. Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands, Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite Into the phone in German he says;
COL.LANDA	Inform The Fuhrer the audience has taken there seats, and we're ready to begin. Step one, in Hans master plan, done. He then dials another number... Aldo in the lobby... .he's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS... He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern ,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing shepherd... anything.
COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS)	Shut up! The faceless black hood does. Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded
COL.LANDA	As Stanley said to Livingston; Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume? I 'to.
LT. ALDO	Hans Landa?
COL.LANDA	You've had a nice long run, Aldo. Alas, your now in the hands of the SS. My hands to be exact. And they've been waiting along time, to touch you. He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.
COL.LANDA	Caught ya flinching. In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck. The Truck drives off. Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers Landa smiles. We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino. The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the Utivich, is crying inside his hood.
LT.ALDO	Utivich?
UTIVICH	Is that you Lieutenant?
LT. ALDO	Yep. lyl.
UTIVIC}I	Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirchberg? The woman?
LT.ALDO	No I do not.
UTIVICH	Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying.
LT. ALDO	Nothin to be sorry about, son. This bag, get to anyone.
UTIVICH	Not exactly John Wayne, am I?
LT.ALDO	John Waynes a pampered movie star. He burst into tears, if his cook, busts his yoke at breakfast. Just try puttin a bag over his head, and hear what kinda sounds he makes. Utivich, giggles through the tears.
LT.ALDO	I just want you to know, son, I was real proud of you tonight. Learnin how to drive overnight. Driving in that Limo line. You was in the hot seat, son, and you stood up real good. Utivich Cries LOUDER. Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich. The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment. The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at a impressive looking two way Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled, They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.
COL.LANDA	Italian? Really? What could you have possibly been thinking?
LT. ALDO	Well, I speak alittle Italian -
COL.LANDA	I speak a little Tagalog, but I wouldn't begin to presume I could pass for Filipino. Don't get me wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still.... Chico Marx is more convincing. if the three of you had shown up to the premiere dressed in womans attire, it would have been more convincing. Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners. You may leave us. But stay alert outside. They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the
COL.LANDA	So your Aldo the Apache?
LT. ALDO	So your The Jew Hunter?
COL.LANDA	Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective. A damn good detective. Finding people is my specialty. So naturally, I worked for the Nazi's finding people. And yes, some of them were Jews. But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.
UTIVICH	Well you do hafts admit, it is catchy.
COL.LANDA	Do you control the nicknames, your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the Apache and The Little Man?
UTIVICH	What do you mean, The Little Man?
COL.LANDA	The Germans nickname for you.
UTIVICH	The Germans nickname for me is, The Little Man?
COL.LANDA	Or "The Little One, ether one means you. And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life. I mean, your a little fellow. But not circus midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
LT.ALDO	Where is my men? Where is Bridget Von Hammersmark?
COL.LANDA	Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure she's in whatever, big bubbling cesspool in hell, the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk. Well, lets just say, she got what she deserved. And when you purchase friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for. Now as far as your Pisanos, Sgt.Donowitz, and Pt.Hirschberg-
LT. ALDO	How do you know our names?
COL.LANDA	Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika marked survivors... .? We simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed. Now, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs. At this moment, both Hirschberg, and Donowitz, should be sitting in the very seats we left them in. Seats, 0023 and 0024, if my memory serves. Explosives, still around there ankle, still ready to explode. And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go. The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.
LT. ALDO	That's a pretty exciting story. What's next, Eliza on the ice?
COL.LANDA	However, all I have to do, is pick pick up that phone right there. Inform the cinema, and your plans kupet.
LT. ALDO	IF, their still there, and IF their still alive, and that's one big IF, there ain't no way, you gonna take them boys without settin off them bombs. I R.T.
M	I have no doubt, and yes, some Germans will die., and yes, it will ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels will be very very very mad at you for what you've done to his big night. But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Gering, and you won't get Boorman. And you need all four to end the war. But if I don't pick up that phone, right there, you may very well get all four. And if you get all four, you end the war...tonight. The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills
COL.LANDA	So gentlemen, lets discuss the prospect of ending the war-tonight. All three have their Chianti filled glasses.
COL.LANDA	So the way I see it, since Hitlers death, or possible rescue, rests solely on my reaction...If I do nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his death, even more then yourselves. Would you agree?
LT. ALDO	I guess so.
COL.LANDA	How about you Uitivich?
UITIVICH	I guess so too.
COL.LANDA	Good, we more or less, all agree. Gentlemen, I have no intention, of Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels, and Killing Gerring, and killing Boorman, not to mention winning the war single handedly for the allies, only later, to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
I q	Now they get it.
COL.LANDA	If you want to win the war, tonight, We have to make a deal.
LT.ALDO	What kinda deal?
COL.LANDA	The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make. However, I'm sure this mission of yours, has a commanding officer? A General, I'm betting. For .. .O.S.S. would be my guess. Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.
COL.LANDA	Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the way you say it, That's a bingo?
LT.ALDO	You just say, bingo.
COL.LANDA	Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over there is a very capable two way radio. And sitting behind it, is a more then capable radio operator, named Herrman. Get me somebody on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen, to authorize my - Let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender, if that taste better going down.
BACK TO THE PREMIERE	Shosanna in the booth, she brings down the lights. In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part. The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM... 35mm FILM moves through the projectors film gate... Goebbels and Francesca watch... Hitler watches... Fredrick watches... Donowitz and Hirschberg watch... Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window... Landa, with radio headphones over his ears, and a microphone
COL.LANDA	.So, when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded, that I was part of "Operation Rino" from the very beginning, as a double agent. Anything I've done in my guise as a SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The O.S.S., as a necessary evil to establish my cover with The Germans. And it was my placement, of Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels opera box that assured there demise. By the way, that last part is actually true.
FLASH ON	Landa placing bomb in Goebbels and Francesca's opera box. I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank. I want to receive the congregational medal of honor, for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich. He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one sided
COL.LANDA	In fact, I want all the members of "Operation Kino" to receive the congregational medal of honor. Full citizenship for myself - but that goes without saying. And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantuckett island, as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist party to a swifter then imanged end. Do you have all that, sir? I look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir. He's right here. The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.
LT.ALDO	Yes, sir? We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his
RADIO VOICE(OS)	Colonel Landa will put you and Private Uitivich in a truck as prisoners. Then he and his radio operator, will get in the truck, drive to our lines. Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you. You will then take over driving of the truck, a bring them straight to me for debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?
LT.ALDO	Yes, sir. The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down. The three men look at one another. Landa picks up his wine.
COL.LANDA	So I suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass, and toast to Donowitz and Hirschbergs success. You too Herrman, come over here. The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine, Pvt.Smithson
COL.LANDA	Gentlemen, To history, and it's Witnesses. Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in

Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can't set his bomb surrounded by all these Nazi's. Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle Hirschberg doesn't get it.

FREDRICK	Are you the manager, of this cinema? I want my money back. That actor in the movie stinks. He laughs.

SHOSANNA	What are you doing here?
FREDRICK	I came to visit you.
SHOSANNA	Can't you see how busy I am?
FREDRICK	Then allow me to lend a assist.
SHOSANNA	Fredrick it's not funny, you can't be here. This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them. As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
FREDRICK	Normally, you would be.right. And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper sprit. However the fact remains, this film, is based on my military exploits. And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing many men. Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now,... .I don't like watching this part.
SHOSANNA	Fredrick, I am sorry, but -
FREDRICK	- So, I thought, I'd come up here and do what I do best, annoy you. And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch.

SHOSANNA	Fredrick, you hurt me.
FREDRICK	Well, it's nice to know you can feel something. Even if it's just physical pain. Fredrick steps forward... Shosanna steps backwards...
FREDRICK	I'm not a man you say, "Go away" to. There's over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could, would testify to that. After what I've done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.
