CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
NARRATOR	Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769. He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion. In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	My mother has always loved me. She would do anything for me.
NAPOLEON	Who has been putting glass in my pitcher? Look here, someone has filled my pitcher with glass!
DUFOUR	Oh, my goodness! Someone has filled Bonaparte's pitcher with glass. Now, who on earth would do a thing like that?
BREMOND	my pitcher with glass too!
MONK	Silence! Silence! You should not make fun of Monsieur Bonaparte, he comes from a country where it is never very cold. He has probably never seen ice before.
DUFOUR	Never seen ice before? Oh, dear me -- how very odd.
NARRATOR	At the age of 9, Napoleon entered the Royal Military College at Brienne, in France, under a royal scholarship. For the next five and a half years, he would devote himself to preparation for his military career. These were harsh and cheerless years for the lonely, impoverished provincial, among affluent French noblemen's sons.
BREMOND	Good afternoon, Bonaparte.
BREMOND	What are you reading?
BREMOND	Dear me, aren't we in an unfriendly mood. Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Aren't we terribly conscientious about our studies? By the way, did the supervisor give you permission to take that book away from the school grounds?
NAPOLEON	Fuck off, Bremond.
BREMOND	Oh, my goodness. What language! Did you learn that from your mother, Bonaparte?
NAPOLEON	Fuck off!
DUFOUR	Oh, goodness, my dear Bonaparte -- I am clumsy. Oh, and look at your book!
NARRATOR	At the age of 16, he graduated a sub-lieutenant from the Royal Military School in Paris, and was posted to the crack regiment de la Fere, at Valence.
NARRATOR	The practical professional training that Napoleon would receive for the next three years would give him a working knowledge of all arms, and expose him to the advanced military ideas of du Teil, Bourcet and Guibert.
NARRATOR	His moods at this time were complex and varied. Life is a burden for me. Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me. It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
NARRATOR	He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
GIRL	Good evening, sir.
NAPOLEON	Good evening, Mademoiselle.
GIRL	The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
NAPOLEON	Yes, it is. It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
GIRL	Yes, it must be.
NAPOLEON	You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
GIRL	Yes, I am, sir.
NAPOLEON	Then what brings you out on such a night?
GIRL	Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
NAPOLEON	Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
GIRL	One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
NAPOLEON	No, I'm only here on leave. My regiment is at Valence.
GIRL	Are you staying with a friend, sir?
NAPOLEON	No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
GIRL	Is it a nice warm room, sir?
NAPOLEON	Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
GIRL	Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
NAPOLEON	Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
GIRL	Do you have three francs, sir?
GIRL	Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
NAPOLEON	Oh, I'm sorry about that.
NAPOLEON	What's your name?
GIRL	Lisette.
NAPOLEON	Only Lisette?
GIRL	Lisette La Croix.
NAPOLEON	That's a very nice name. Where are you from?
GIRL	Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
NAPOLEON	Oh, yes... of course.
VARLAC	Citizens, word has come from Paris that the foul prison of the Bastille has been captured. That its Governor's head is up on a pike. All Paris is now in the hands of its people. Soon all France will be in the hands of its people.
VARLAC	Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
NAPOLEON	I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot. Do you know him, monsieur?
VARLAC	Very well, Citizen Lieutenant. You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
NAPOLEON	Contrary to what you have been telling these good people, Monsieur Varlac, France is still in the hands of its proper authorities, and they have sent me here with a warrant for your arrest. You are charged with the murder of Monseigneur de Bouchy and his son, and the burning of his chateau.
VARLAC	A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant. One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
NAPOLEON	You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac. I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
VARLAC	Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant? For I was not there alone.
NAPOLEON	No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you. Now, will you please come down at once. You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
VARLAC	Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men. We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
NAPOLEON	Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech. Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
VARLAC	I do not recognize the authority of the King or any of his lackeys.
VARLAC	I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
NAPOLEON	Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
NAPOLEON	One... Two... Three...
NAPOLEON	Four... This is your last chance, Monsieur Varlac.
NAPOLEON	Five...
NAPOLEON	A confessed murderer has just been shot. Now, let all honest men return to their homes.
NAPOLEON	Incredible... Incredible... How could he let that rabble into the Palace? If he had ridden out among them on a white horse, they would all have gone home. If he lacked the courage to do that, a whiff of grapeshot -- and they would still be running.
NARRATOR	In the summer of 1793, Civil war swept through France, and the important naval base at Toulon fell into the hands of a Royalist insurrection, which quickly handed over the port to a combined British and Spanish fleet.
NARRATOR	A French army of 10,000 was ordered to retake the port, but its commander, General Carteaux, a well- known Parisian painter, had little experience in war and the siege quickly became a stalemate.
NARRATOR	Paul Francois Nicolas Barras, former Viscount, now Citizen Deputy from the Committee of Public Safety, had been sent from Paris to personally report on the failure of the Siege.
BARRAS	Citizen generals, I have read all your reports and noted your signatures. In substance, your views are unanimous. The English positions, defending Toulon, are too strong to be taken by our present force. The two unsuccessful attacks to date would appear to support your arguments.
BARRAS	Citizen generals, it is no secret with what displeasure the Committee of Safety looks upon any lack of patriotism or revolutionary zeal. On the other hand, it obviously does not wish to indulge in a futile waste of life. Before I send your reports to Paris for the Committee's review, together with my opinion, I should like to give you a final opportunity to present any new ideas which you may have developed since writing these reports.
CARTEAUX	Citizen Barras, since there does not seem to have been any new thoughts among us, may we know the opinion which you, yourself, have formed?
BARRAS	General Carteaux, my report on the conduct of this campaign will go in writing to the committee.
NAPOLEON	Excuse me, Citizen Barras.
BARRAS	Yes -- who spoke up?
NAPOLEON	I did, sir.
BARRAS	Yes, Captain? Have you anything you wish to say?
NAPOLEON	Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
BARRAS	Please...
NAPOLEON	May I come to the map?
NARRATOR	In July of 1794, the death of Robespierre ended the Reign of Terror and sent Paris headlong into a lavish whirl of pleasure seeking and sensuality, as if it were necessary to shake off the nightmare and make up for lost time.
CORSICAN	Yes, sir?
NAPOLEON	A glass of champagne, please.
CORSICAN	Yes, sir. I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
NAPOLEON	Yes, I am.
CORSICAN	I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced. I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
NAPOLEON	Oh -- where do you come from?
CORSICAN	Bastia -- and you?
NAPOLEON	Ajaccio.
CORSICAN	Have you been back recently?
NAPOLEON	I haven't been there for three years.
CORSICAN	I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
NAPOLEON	No, they're living in Nice now.
CORSICAN	That's a nice city. This is your first time here, isn't it?
NAPOLEON	Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
CORSICAN	You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
NAPOLEON	Ah-hh, no.
CORSICAN	I thought not. I noticed you by yourself, all night.
CORSICAN	Just a minute, General. Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da. They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
NAPOLEON	I see...
CORSICAN	And they say something else about him. They say he never goes to bed with less than two at a time -- two at a time, and they say it doesn't make a lot of difference to him which sex they are, if you follow my meaning, sir.
CORSICAN	Have a nice evening, General.
BARRAS	My friends, dinner will be ready in half an hour. Please make your plays accordingly.
BARRAS	How is your luck, darling?
NARRATOR	A new political crisis was brewing in Paris. The moderate government of the Convention, which came to power after the fall of Robespierre, soon showed itself to be inept, corrupt and unpopular -- and it was now faced with a serious challenge from the royalists. General Menou, sent out to deal with the mob, lost his nerve and agreed to withdraw his troops from the Section.
ROYALIST SPEAKER	Citizens of Paris, this morning, the troops of the Convention, under orders to sweep us from the streets, gave way before our victorious banners. Their officers knew they would not fire upon us. Citizens of Paris, nothing can stop us now. We are 40,000 strong. Tomorrow morning, we will occupy the Convention itself, and we will exterminate the hypocritical parasites who have bled France without pity. Long Live the King!
BARRAS	Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in. Please sit down.
NAPOLEON	I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
BARRAS	Thank you for coming. Would you care for a drink?
NAPOLEON	No, thank you.
BARRAS	I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
NAPOLEON	Things are quite serious, I should say.
BARRAS	We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
NAPOLEON	What do you have in mind?
BARRAS	To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
NAPOLEON	Are you serious?
BARRAS	I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
NAPOLEON	What forces do you have at your disposal?
BARRAS	About 5,000 troops.
NAPOLEON	Cavalry?
BARRAS	The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
NAPOLEON	Any cannon?
BARRAS	There are none here.
NAPOLEON	Where are they?
BARRAS	Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
NAPOLEON	You could have them here by daybreak.
BARRAS	Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
NAPOLEON	Properly arranged, yes.
BARRAS	These are odds of 8 to 1.
NAPOLEON	The numbers are not particularly relevant. You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
BARRAS	Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
NAPOLEON	Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
BARRAS	In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
NAPOLEON	Fair enough.
BARRAS	I must be honest with you. I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
NAPOLEON	I'm not insulted.
BARRAS	You realize what is at stake?
NAPOLEON	Our lives, the revolution, my career?
BARRAS	Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
NAPOLEON	Paul, everything will be all right.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	I ordered the artillery to fire ball immediately, instead of blanks, because, to a mob, who are ignorant of fire arms, it is the worst possible policy to start out firing blanks. When they first hear the terrific noise of the guns, they are frightened, but, looking around them and seeing no effect from the cannon, they pick up their spirits, become twice as insolent and rush on fearlessly. It becomes necessary then to kill ten times their number to make an impression.
NARRATOR	The crisis was over, and the way was paved for the formation of the new government of the Directory, with Barras at its head. Napoleon was made Commander of the Army of Italy.
MARMONT	Come in.
ORDERLY	Excuse me, Captain, but there is a young man outside who wishes to see General Bonaparte -- his name is Eugene de Beauharnais.
MARMONT	General Bonaparte is seeing no one this morning.
ORDERLY	Yes, sir.
NAPOLEON	What did you say his name was?
ORDERLY	Eugene de Beauharnais.
NAPOLEON	Is he alone?
ORDERLY	Yes, sir.
NAPOLEON	Show him in.
ORDERLY	Citizen de Beauharnais.
NAPOLEON	Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
EUGENE	Good morning, sir. Are you General Bonaparte?
NAPOLEON	I am, Citizen. Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
EUGENE	Yes, sir. Are you acquainted with her?
NAPOLEON	I have met her. What is your business with me?
EUGENE	I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
NAPOLEON	That is correct.
EUGENE	This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons. I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
NAPOLEON	A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
EUGENE	I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
NAPOLEON	And he sent you to me?
EUGENE	He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
NAPOLEON	Does your mother know you have come?
EUGENE	No, sir.
NAPOLEON	Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
EUGENE	My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
NAPOLEON	You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected. How do you expect me to find yours?
EUGENE	The Lieutenant gave me a receipt for it and said it would be kept at the Section Le Pelletier Police Barracks.
HORTENSE	Mama, this is General Bonaparte.
NAPOLEON	Madame de Beauharnais.
JOSEPHINE	Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte. One has read so much about you lately. Please sit down.
NAPOLEON	Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
JOSEPHINE	Oh... yes, of course! Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
NAPOLEON	Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
JOSEPHINE	May I offer you a drink?
NAPOLEON	Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
JOSEPHINE	Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
NAPOLEON	You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais. Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
JOSEPHINE	Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
HORTENSE	Yes, mama. Will you excuse me, General Bonaparte?
NAPOLEON	Yes, of course.
NAPOLEON	I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais. I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
JOSEPHINE	Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
NAPOLEON	Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
JOSEPHINE	General Bonaparte, my curiosity is unbearable. May I ask what you have in that mysterious package?
NAPOLEON	Your late husband's sword, Madame, returned with my compliments.
JOSEPHINE	Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
NAPOLEON	No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
JOSEPHINE	Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be! My dearest Josephine -- I awaken full of you. Between your portrait and the memory of our intoxicating night, my senses have had no respite. Sweet and incomparable Josephine, what is this bizarre effect you have upon my heart? What if you were to by angry? What if I were to see you sad or troubled? Then my soul would be shattered by distress. Then your lover could find no peace, no rest. But I find none, either, when I succumb to the profound emotion that overwhelms me, when I draw up from your lips, from your heart, a flame that consumes me. You will be leaving the city at noon. But I shall see you in three hours. Until then, mio dolce amor, I send you a thousand kisses -- but send me none in return, for they set my blood on fire. My dear Theresa -- I am being urged to remarry. You have met General Bonaparte at my house. Well, then, it is he who wishes to serve as father to my children. Do I love him? You are going to ask me. Well, no. Do I, then, find him unattractive? Again, no -- but worse still, I find myself in a state of indifference, of lukewarmness.
NAPOLEON	Mama, I'm sorry that I didn't write to you about this, but I thought that it would be much better to tell you myself.
NAPOLEON	Mama, I know that when you meet her, you will love her as much as I do.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	My dearest Josephine, every moment increases the distance between us, and with every moment that passes I feel myself less able to endure the separation. You are the eternal object of my thoughts, and my imagination exhausts itself wondering what you are doing.
By what magic have you captivated	all my faculties, concentrated in yourself all my existence? It is a kind of death, my darling, since there is no survival for me except in you. nor fidelity, but only truth, utter honesty. The day upon which you should say "I love you less," would be the last day of my love -- or the last day of my life. And if I should not die of sorrow, then, my heart, maimed for life, would never again trust itself to respond to any sentiments of tenderness or rapture.
You let many days go without writing	to me. What, then, are you doing? that you realize that I love you with a love that is beyond the limits of imagination. That you, you alone, and all of you, as I see you, as you are -- only you can please me, absorb the faculties of my soul; that there is no corner of my heart into which you do not see, no thought of mine which is not subordinate to you. That my arms, my strength, my mind are all yours. That my soul lives in your body. That the world is beautiful only because you inhabit it. every four days do I receive one, whereas if you loved me you would write me twice a day. Absence relieves minor attachments but it intensifies love. A kiss upon your mouth, upon your heart, everywhere. There is no one else, no one but me, is there?
Your letter is brief, sad and	written in a trembling hand. What is wrong with you, my darling?
My misfortune is to have known you	so little; yours, to have judged me by the men you have known, who surrounded you.
You have inspired in me a limitless	passion, and an intoxication that is degrading. Josephine, you have made me wretched. But I have never believed in happiness. Is life really worth making such a fuss? scrap of a letter to break the news that you are not coming, that you are ill, that there are three doctors in attendance, that you cannot write yourself. My life is now a perpetual nightmare. A fatal premonition stops me from breathing. I am ill of your illness, burning with your fever. notes of three lines each. Good God, tell me how you know so well how to inspire love in other's hearts, without feeling it in your own? Make mock of me, stay on in Paris, take lovers, let all the world know it, never write to me -- and then? And then, I shall love you ten times more than I did before!
But don't go on telling me that you	are ill; don't go on trying to justify your behavior. You are forgiven.
Your letters are as cold as	friendship. What is left for you to do to make me more wretched? Stop loving me? That's already done. Hate me? Perhaps I should hope for that. Hatred, at least, is not humiliating. But, oh, indifference -- the pulse of marble, the vacant glance, the distracted air.
GENERAL LE CLERC	I should like you to meet my aide- de-camp, Captain Hippolyte Charles -- Madame Bonaparte.
CAPTAIN CHARLES	I am delighted to meet you, Madame Bonaparte.
JOSEPHINE	Thank you, Captain. Won't you both please sit down?
GENERAL LE CLERC	Thank you very much, Madame Bonaparte. I have come at the instruction of General Bonaparte to bring this letter from his mother in Nice.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	Soldiers, you are half-naked and badly clothed. The authorities find much fault with you and yet can give nothing. Your patience, your courage are admirable but you are not getting any fame. I will lead you into the must fruitful plains in the world -- rich provinces and great cities shall be your possessions, and then you will have wealth, honor and fame in full measure.
NARRATOR	With the Italian campaign, Napoleon steps onto the stage as a figure of European importance. A dozen victories in as many months would be announced in dramatic and highly colored bulletins. The battles of the revolution had been so far mainly defensive. Now, there was revealed a new kind of offensive warfare such as had not been seen in Europe for centuries.
NARRATOR	Napoleon now introduced a new era of wars of maneuver. Everything would be sacrificed to mobility. The complicated battle formations of the 18th century would be abandoned, and the army freed from clumsy baggage trains. War would be made to feed on war. The armies opposing him were still committed to the rigid ideas of the previous era, and their soldiers were treated as automatons. As they could not be trusted to forage for themselves without deserting, such armies were slowed down by their supply trains. The revolution, on the other hand, had produced an army of intelligent citizens, which could move fast by living off the country, and in which courage and initiative were rewarded by promotion.
MAJOR	Captain, take 20 men. Assemble all the inhabitants on the main street, and collect all mail and newspapers.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	There is no man more cautious than I am when planning a campaign. I exaggerate all the dangers, and all the disasters that might occur. I look quite serene to my staff, but I am like a woman in labor. Once I have made up my mind, everything is forgotten, except what leads to success.
studies this exchange of fire to better	
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	The art of war is a simple art. Everything is in the execution. There is nothing vague in it. It is all common sense. Theory does not enter into it. The simplest moves are always the best.
NARRATOR	Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy. Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him. From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be. Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
JOSEPHINE (V.O.)	My dear Therese, the journey here to Milan was the most difficult and uncomfortable imaginable -- I am bored to death. My husband doesn't love me, he worships me. I fear he will go mad with love. Worse than that, I fear for my poor Hippolyte. We may have been indiscreet on the journey, and I think Joseph and Junot suspect something.
NAPOLEON	Come in, Captain Charles.
NAPOLEON	I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
CHARLES	Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
NAPOLEON	Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
CHARLES	Yes, sir, I am.
NAPOLEON	Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
CHARLES	Yes, sir.
NAPOLEON	Was the trip normal in every respect?
CHARLES	Yes, sir.
NAPOLEON	Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
CHARLES	No, sir, none at all.
NAPOLEON	Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
CHARLES	Thank you, sir.
NAPOLEON	You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
CHARLES	Thank you, sir. I will do that.
NAPOLEON	You may go, Captain Charles.
NAPOLEON	I would like both of you to read this. Please read it aloud.
JOSEPH	To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife. You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
NAPOLEON	Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
JOSEPH	No...
NAPOLEON	Junot?
JUNOT	No, one cannot simply ignore it.
NAPOLEON	I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
JOSEPH	No... nothing at all.
NAPOLEON	Not even the slightest hint of something?
JOSEPH	No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage. In the evenings, he always ate at another table. They hardly ever spoke to each other.
NAPOLEON	You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
JOSEPH	Yes, of course, I would. You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
NAPOLEON	And you, Junot?
JUNOT	No... No, I don't know anything about it either. Not a thing.
NAPOLEON	Well, thank you both. As I said, I shall regard this as a piece of malevolence from someone who does not wish well to myself or Josephine. Naturally, I shall trust to your discretion to say nothing about this.
NARRATOR	On July 2, 1798, Napoleon arrived in Egypt with an army of 40,000 men, and a romantic dream of conquest, following Alexander's march into India. The Directory had been quick to approve his plan for attacking England, indirectly, through their Eastern Empire, rather than by invasion of Britain, and they breathed a sigh of relief to have their unemployed conqueror off the doorstep.
NARRATOR	There was an air of grandiose fantasy about the expedition. Napoleon took along a hundred and fifty distinguished scientists, intellectuals and artists equipped with libraries and scientific instruments. They would found the Institute of Egypt, do the preliminary survey work for the Suez canal, and unlock the key to hieroglyphic writing.
NAPOLEON	Good afternoon, gentlemen. I hope you are enjoying this unusual spectacle. One cannot see this in Paris for any price.
MONGE	Are we doing well, General Bonaparte?
NAPOLEON	We are doing very well, my dear Monge. The mameluke cavalry are brave but they are selling their lives at a bad price -- at a rate, I should say, of 50-1. My only fear is that Murad Bey has some means of communicating with his men, and that he will manage to call them off before we can kill a great many more.
NAPOLEON	Those are excellent sketches, Denon. May I have them when you are finished?
NAPOLEON	Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family? Must you...
NAPOLEON	Come in!
JUNOT	I believe you sent for me.
NAPOLEON	Yes, yes, please sit down. I will be with you in a moment.
NAPOLEON	Read it back.
BOURRIENNE	To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure. I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose. Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
NAPOLEON	Oh, shit, that's not right.
NAPOLEON	Leave us alone, Bourrienne, and come back in half an hour.
NAPOLEON	God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
JUNOT	There's probably some explanation.
NAPOLEON	Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
NAPOLEON	Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles? I asked for it yesterday.
JUNOT	I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
NAPOLEON	Why did you give it to him?
JUNOT	I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
NAPOLEON	Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
JUNOT	I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
NAPOLEON	I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
JUNOT	He's downstairs -- somewhere.
NAPOLEON	All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here.
JUNOT	Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
NAPOLEON	Certainly.
JUNOT	I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
NAPOLEON	Why not?
JUNOT	Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
NAPOLEON	What are you talking about?
JUNOT	Nothing. That's all I can say.
NAPOLEON	That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
JUNOT	That's all I can say.
NAPOLEON	Now, just a minute. You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
JUNOT	Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
NAPOLEON	Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
JUNOT	There are some things... better left unsaid.
NAPOLEON	You mean about my wife?! You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
NAPOLEON	What the hell is the matter with you?
JUNOT	I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you. I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
NAPOLEON	Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now. Do you understand?!
JUNOT	You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
NAPOLEON	Yes.
JUNOT	I wrote it.
NAPOLEON	What?
JUNOT	Yes, I wrote it.
NAPOLEON	You wrote it.
JUNOT	I couldn't face telling you.
NAPOLEON	You couldn't face telling me what?
JUNOT	About Hippolyte Charles.
NAPOLEON	What was there to tell?
JUNOT	My God, what do you think?
NAPOLEON	Do you know what you're saying?
JUNOT	God help me -- yes.
NAPOLEON	How do you know?
JUNOT	I know.
NAPOLEON	How do you know?
JUNOT	I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
NAPOLEON	Yes?
JUNOT	I could hear them, in the next room.
NAPOLEON	You could hear them?
JUNOT	Yes.
NAPOLEON	You mean you heard them making love?
JUNOT	Yes.
NAPOLEON	How did you know it was Captain Charles?
JUNOT	I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
NAPOLEON	Can you give me a drink, please?
JUNOT	Yes, of course. What do you want?
JUNOT	I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
NAPOLEON	And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
JUNOT	I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
BOURRIENNE (O.S.)	General Bonaparte?
NAPOLEON	Come back in an hour.
BOURRIENNE (O.S.)	Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
NAPOLEON	Come in.
BOURRIENNE	This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
NAPOLEON	Let me see it.
NAPOLEON	Nelson has engaged Brueys off Aboukir. Brueys is dead and we have lost eleven ships.
NARRATOR	On October 9th, 1799, Napoleon, with only a small entourage, arrived at the port of Frejus, in France, after a journey of six weeks, in which he evaded a large British fleet. The news of his arrival threw France into a delirium of joy. His return was seen as a kind of deliverance, by a nation in the grip of economic chaos, near anarchy and the threat of invasion.
NAPOLEON	Nelson's victory at Aboukir quite effectively finished the strategic purpose of the campaign, and with the loss of all our principal fighting ships, the army was marooned in Egypt, and our communications with the continent were severed. The only options remaining to me were to develop the occupation of Egypt, to maintain the morale of my army, and to respond to the threats being created by the English and, very soon, the Turks. This was accomplished, culminating in my final victory against the Turks, when they attempted a landing at Aboukir.
GOHIER	I wonder if you would care to tell us, General Bonaparte, why, so soon after this admirable victory, you decided to... abandon your army and return to France?
NAPOLEON	Citizen Gohier, my army was not abandoned -- it was left in a very strong position, and in the capable hands of General Kleber.
GOHIER	Of course, General Bonaparte. An unfortunate choice of words. Only the enemies of your glory, whom we shall regard as our own, would wish to give adverse interpretation to the honorable motives of patriotism, which I am sure, induced you to... leave... your colors. Please continue.
NAPOLEON	After the defeat of the Turks, a negotiation to arrange the exchange of prisoners took place aboard Sir Sidney Smith's flagship. At the end of the first meeting, Sir Sidney gave my chief negotiator, General Marmont, several German newspapers, of a fairly recent date.
NAPOLEON	Now, you must bear in mind that for more than a year I had received no news at all from Europe, not a newspaper or a single mail packet. Perhaps you can imagine my state of mind when I read of the serious defeats that had been inflicted upon France during my absence: the loss of Italy, the Anglo-Russian army's occupation of Holland, the imminent invasion of France herself. After several days of deliberation, it seemed clear to me that it was my duty to risk the English blockade and, with a few small ships, attempt to return, to serve my country in any way that might be possible.
starts over Napoleon's dialogue which fades	
NARRATOR	The government of the Directory was bankrupt, and its presses ran all night printing the money it would spend the next day. Two of its five members, Sieyes and Roger-Ducos, who had the support of the moderate political factions, were preparing to seize power. They would welcome the inclusion of Napoleon who would secure the support of the army, and who was now the most popular figure in France.
NAPOLEON	The important thing is to find the right lawyer. One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
JOSEPH	You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
NAPOLEON	I know of no better time.
JOSEPH	You can't be serious. It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
NAPOLEON	The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
JOSEPH	You must not act impetuously.
NAPOLEON	It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
JOSEPH	But you can do the same thing in six months. The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
NAPOLEON	My mind is made up. She will not set foot in my house again. I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
JOSEPH	Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
NAPOLEON	Are you trying to insult me?
JOSEPH	Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
NAPOLEON	Well, you shall see.
JOSEPH	When is she supposed to return?
NAPOLEON	I have no idea. Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is. But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
JOSEPH	She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
NAPOLEON	My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
NAPOLEON	Were you in love with him?
JOSEPHINE	I thought I was. I was confused.
NAPOLEON	And now?
JOSEPHINE	Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
NAPOLEON	Do you expect me to believe that?
JOSEPHINE	Yes.
JOSEPHINE	And you, are you in love with any one else?
NAPOLEON	No.
JOSEPHINE	But you have had mistresses while you were away.
NAPOLEON	Of course.
JOSEPHINE	Were you in love with any of them?
NAPOLEON	No.
JOSEPHINE	Were they pretty?
NAPOLEON	Yes.
JOSEPHINE	Were any of them prettier than I am?
NAPOLEON	One had better legs.
JOSEPHINE	Were any of them married?
NAPOLEON	Yes. They were the easiest. I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
JOSEPHINE	She must have been in love with you.
NAPOLEON	Not in the least. After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
JOSEPHINE	Promise me you will never leave me.
NAPOLEON	I cannot promise you that.
JOSEPHINE	Promise me.
NAPOLEON	I will never forgive you.
JOSEPHINE	I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
NAPOLEON	I don't understand you.
JOSEPHINE	Promise.
NAPOLEON	Promises mean nothing.
JOSEPHINE	Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
NAPOLEON	All right -- I promise.
JOSEPHINE	You are my old friend.
NARRATOR	For the next three weeks, conspiracy was openly carried on in Paris -- in the salons of bankers, generals, politicians and government officials.
NARRATOR	The man responsible for protecting the government, the Minister of Police, Joseph Fouche, was part of the plot.
NARRATOR	In the early morning hours on November 9th, notifications of an emergency meeting of the councils, to be held that morning at 7 o'clock, were delivered to those deputies who supported the conspiracy.
NARRATOR	Sieyes warned the sympathetic deputies of an imminent plot to seize the government by the radical Jacobin party, none of whose members had been summoned to the assembly. He then proposed two resolutions which were quickly passed.
NARRATOR	The first called for the appointment of Napoleon to command the troops assigned to protect the councils. The second called for the councils to be moved, on the following day, to St. Cloud, ten miles from Paris, where they would be safe, and out of reach of the Paris mob.
NARRATOR	Later, the same day, the three members of the Directory who were not part of the plot were effectively taken out of the picture. Barras was forced to resign under threat of death and an offer of gilded exile.
NARRATOR	Gohier and Moulins, who would not be intimidated, were locked up under guard at the Luxembourg.
NARRATOR	The next morning, on November 10th, at the Palace of St. Cloud, the final moves were to be made which would bring Napoleon to supreme power.
DELBREL	Citizen Deputies, we have been isolated here at St. Cloud and surrounded by troops. Yesterday, we were told this was to protect us against a plot to seize the government. Today we are told that all five members of the Directory have suddenly, and without any warning, resigned. Now we have been asked to pass a resolution forming a provisional government, of three consuls to replace the five directors -- these three consuls being General Bonaparte and two of the newly-resigned members of the Directory, Sieyes and Roger-Ducos. We have further been asked to adjourn this assembly for a period of three months, leaving all executive and administrative power in the hands of the three newly- appointed consuls, who will then draw up a new Constitution.
DELBREL	Citizen Deputies, does any one in this room have the slightest doubts as to what is being attempted, or to the identity of those who are involved?
DELBREL	Especially so, since I have it on excellent authority that the three members of the Directory who are not present here today have, indeed, not resigned willingly, but in the case of Gohier and Moulins, they are under arrest in the Luxembourg -- and, in the case of Barras, a resignation was forced from him under threat of death.
LUCIEN BONAPARTE	Order, order, order. Citizen Delbrel, you are out of order. You are out of order.
DELBREL	And you, Citizen Bonaparte -- your role as President of this assembly is an honorary one, given only for the period on one month, on the occasion of your brother's return from Egypt. And since your nomination was originally put forward by the two conspirators, Sieyes and Roger-Ducos, I demand that you immediately disqualify yourself from these proceedings and leave this chamber!!
LUCIEN BONAPARTE	You are out of order, Citizen Delbrel! You are out of order!
NAPOLEON	Come in.
ORDERLY	Major Lavallette to see you, General.
NAPOLEON	Send him in.
LAVALLETTE	General Bonaparte, I have a message from Lucien. He says there is not chance at all now to bring the proposals to a vote. Delbrel has given the alarm to the other parties. He says you must either use the troops immediately, or think of saving yourselves.
SIEYES	Oh, my God. I told you he should have been arrested yesterday. Why did I listen to you?
JOSEPH	Will you use the troops?
NAPOLEON	Only as a last resort. What are the Councils doing now?
LAVALLETTE	Both chambers are swearing an oath to the Constitution.
NAPOLEON	Come in.
ORDERLY	A message from Citizen Fouche.
NAPOLEON	Let me have it.
NAPOLEON	My dear Bonaparte, if you have not already done so, I urge you to press things to a conclusion. I cannot guarantee the situation for very much longer in Paris.
SIEYES	Go and make sure the carriage and driver are ready to leave at a moment's notice.
SIEYES	Well -- what are you going to do?
NAPOLEON	Have patience -- all will be well.
NAPOLEON	Come in.
ORDERLY	Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
NAPOLEON	Send him in.
BOURRIENNE	A message from Lucien -- he says that you had better act now. Delbrel is going to introduce a motion to halt the oaths and take a vote to outlaw the three of you.
SIEYES	Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We will all be on the guillotine in 24 hours.
NAPOLEON	Please stop chattering -- and let me think.
SIEYES	There is nothing left to think about. We will be outlawed! You've waited too long! I'm leaving, and any one who wishes to save his neck will follow suit. What -- bayonets in here?
DEPUTY #2	Soldiers! You are violating the sanctuary of the laws. Withdraw immediately!
NAPOLEON	Please stand out of the way. Four grenadiers are no threat to you.
DEPUTY #3	Withdraw! Withdraw!
NAPOLEON	Citizen Deputies, please stand out of the way -- I wish to approach the speaker's rostrum!
DEPUTY #1	Is it for this, then, that you became a conqueror?
DEPUTY #4	Withdraw, withdraw immediately, I say!
NAPOLEON	Citizens, please stand aside. I wish to approach the speaker's rostrum.
DEPUTY #2	Down with the Dictator! Down with the Tyrant!
DEPUTY #4	Outlaw him! Outlaw him!
MURAT	Citizens, you are dissolved.
NARRATOR	At the age of 30, Napoleon would now become 1st Consul and head of the Executive, for a period of ten years. The other two Consuls would become merely figure-heads.
cardboard figures, about six inches high,	
NARRATOR	In the five years that followed, Napoleon gave proof of his brilliant legislative, administrative and organizational powers. He created effective and enduring institutions of government; revitalized the economy; negotiated a concordat with the Pope, thus ending the religious rebellion in the Vendee; reconciled the bitterness between right and left by opening all careers to talent, and bringing into his government the best minds of the aristocracy and the ablest survivors of the revolution. Napoleon had secured the main social and material gains of the revolution, destroying privileged orders and modernizing the state. In exchange for this, he would now be given power far more absolute than any Bourbon monarch.
NARRATOR	On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France. He would later say: "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs. The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
NAPOLEON	The revolution failed because the foundation of its political philosophy was in error. Its central dogma was the transference of original sin from man to society. It had the rosy vision that by nature man is good, and that he is only corrupted by an incorrectly organized society. Destroy the offending social institutions, tinker with the machine a bit, and you have Utopia -- presto! -- natural man back in all his goodness.
NAPOLEON	It's a very attractive idea but it simply isn't true. They had the whole thing backwards. Society is corrupt because man is corrupt -- because he is weak, selfish, hypocritical and greedy. And he is not made this way by society, he is born this way -- you can see it even in the youngest children. It's no good trying to build a better society on false assumptions -- authority's main job is to keep man from being at his worst and, thus, make life tolerable, for the greater number of people.
MONSIEUR TRILLAUD	Your Majesty, you certainly have a very pessimistic view of human nature.
NAPOLEON	My dear Monsieur Trillaud, I am not paid for finding it better.
NAPOLEON	You clumsy fool. Quick, we need some water.
MAJOR-DOMO	This way, if you please, Madame.
NAPOLEON	No, no, I'll take care of it myself. We don't want to have any more accidents.
NAPOLEON	Quick, where is the water?
MAJOR-DOMO	Here it is, Your Majesty.
NAPOLEON	Ah, good, here -- allow me, Madame Trillaud.
attention immediately shifts from Madame	
MADAME TRILLAUD	Oh! Your Majesty!
NAPOLEON	Don't be afraid.
MADAME TRILLAUD	But the guests... my husband... the Empress...
NAPOLEON	Don't be afraid, my dear. We shall be back before dessert is finished.
NAPOLEON	Don't worry. It's only the night maid.
NAPOLEON	Yes -- what is it? Open the door. It's me.
NAPOLEON	Go away -- I'm busy. I know what you're doing in there.
NAPOLEON	Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
JOSEPHINE (O.S.)	Where is Madame Trillaud?
NAPOLEON	How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress. What are you doing in there?
NAPOLEON	Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous! If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
JOSEPHINE (O.S.)	Will you be joining us, soon?
NAPOLEON	I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests.
JOSEPHINE (O.S.)	Five minutes.
NAPOLEON	Yes!! Five minutes.
NAPOLEON	Goodbye.
NAPOLEON	Darling -- don't be ridiculous. We have five minutes. Where are you going?
MADAME TRILLAUD	But, Your Majesty, we will be missed now.
NAPOLEON	Of course we won't -- five minutes will never be noticed.
NAPOLEON	How dare you do that to me tonight? How dare you? Do you realize who Madame Trillaud's husband is? Suppose he found out?
NAPOLEON	Oh, shut up, will you?
NAPOLEON	Your tears have absolutely no effect on me... What a fool I have been! I am not a man like any other man. I must be free -- I must be free to do what I please. I must be free of this sordid jealousy!
NAPOLEON	Very well, then, I will not put a specific time limit on this, but you must accept the idea that we will have to be divorced, and soon... And, from now on, we will sleep in separate bedrooms.
JOSEPHINE	Separate bedrooms?
NAPOLEON	Yes.
JOSEPHINE	But you will not... be safe...
NAPOLEON	Not be safe? What on earth are you talking about?
JOSEPHINE	In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
JOSEPHINE (O.S.)	Who is it?
NAPOLEON	It's me.
JOSEPHINE	Oh!
NAPOLEON	Sit down.
NAPOLEON	I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
JOSEPHINE	Oh, my darling. I'm sorry, too. I won't do that again -- whatever you do. I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
JOSEPHINE	Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging. He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
NAPOLEON	Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
NARRATOR	Since the year 1069, France and England had been at war for a total of 152 years. And, from 1338, the Kings of England also called themselves the Kings of France, until Napoleon obliged them to drop this title at the time of the short- lived Peace Treaty of Amiens, in 1802. In the following year, England again declared war on France, and the conflict between British and French imperialism for maritime supremacy and world power would now be fought to a finish.
NARRATOR	The struggle was resumed on familiar and inconclusive lines, as neither side could really get to grips, while England was supreme on the sea and Napoleon on land.
NARRATOR	Napoleon devised a plan to lure the British fleet into a wild goose chase, to the West Indies, leaving the Channel unprotected long enough for the French to ferry their army safely across. But the scheme was poorly executed, and eventually led to the disastrous French naval defeat at Trafalgar.
NARRATOR	Napoleon's invasion plans were foiled by England's correct naval strategy, and by their alliances with Austria and Russia. Subsidized by England, Francis II was goaded into war by Napoleon's assumption of the crown of Italy.
NARRATOR	He was joined by the young, melancholy Tsar Alexander I, who had ascended the throne at the age of 24, after the Palace Guard murder of his father, Tsar Paul, and now had rival pretensions to Napoleon as the arbiter of Europe.
NARRATOR	But four months later, on the anniversary of Napoleon's coronation, Alexander would weep over the shattered wreck of his army, on the battlefield of Austerlitz.
NAPOLEON	Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
FRANCIS	I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
NAPOLEON	I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
FRANCIS	You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
NAPOLEON	Shall we move closer to the fire?
FRANCIS	Yes -- an excellent idea.
NAPOLEON	Will Alexander be joining us soon?
FRANCIS	I very much doubt that he will.
NAPOLEON	Oh...?
FRANCIS	I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
NAPOLEON	I see.
FRANCIS	But he asked me to say... on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his... admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven... and that his army...
NAPOLEON	My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
FRANCIS	I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
NAPOLEON	Would you like some brandy?
FRANCIS	Thank you.
NAPOLEON	I'll have the fire built up.
NAPOLEON	Berthier, we need some more wood for the fire -- and some brandy.
FRANCIS	Thank you, Napoleon.
NAPOLEON	Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
FRANCIS	No -- not as a rule.
NAPOLEON	Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare. You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear. You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
NARRATOR	Having ruined the Austro-Russian alliance by her neutrality, Prussia proceeded, in the following year, to commit suicide by taking on Napoleon single-handed.
NARRATOR	Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon. The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day. today by Haugwitz. War is now imminent. Talleyrand."
NARRATOR	Prussia would make the same strategic error that Austria made in the previous year, and she would over-confidently rush forward to meet the French alone, without waiting for their Russian allies. In seven days of fighting, the Prussian army would be virtually destroyed.
NARRATOR	Unconvinced by his defeat at Austerlitz, committed by alliance to Prussia and concerned about his interest in Poland, Alexander would once again take the field against Napoleon.
NARRATOR	But in June of the following year, after the crushing defeat at Friedland, Alexander would be forced to sue for peace again -- this time in person, and with some surprising results.
ALEXANDER	Ah, my dear, Napoleon, how good it is to meet you at last.
NAPOLEON	And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
ALEXANDER	And, what a delightful idea!
NAPOLEON	Ah -- you approve?
ALEXANDER	I think it's absolutely charming.
NAPOLEON	I'm glad you like it.
ALEXANDER	Whatever suggested the idea to you?
NAPOLEON	I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
NARRATOR	Alexander had come to treat as a fallen enemy, but would find that to be defeated by Napoleon seemed equivalent to winning a great victory. There would be not territorial demands, no reparations -- only an intoxicating proposal to divide the world between them.
NAPOLEON	We have no rivalry, we have no vital issues at stake. We are only at war because you are the ally of England, and, in this, it seems to me, you are serving only the interests of England.
ALEXANDER	If your fight is against England, and against her alone, then we shall easily come to terms -- for I have as much reason to complain as you have. England has brought me into conflict with false promises, and has left me to face defeat single- handed.
NARRATOR	Napoleon and Alexander would spend two weeks together, seeing each other every day and sharing the entertainments of the evening. Each had set out to charm and flatter the other, and each would succeed. They would talk of everything together, as two brothers -- philosophy, women, politics, war, science.
ALEXANDER (V.O.)	My dear sister, God has saved us. Instead of having sacrifices to make, we are coming out of this struggle with a kind of glory. But what do you think about this? I spend whole days with Bonaparte, and hours and hours in private conversation with him. I as you -- isn't this like something from a dream?
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	If Alexander were a woman, I think I should fall passionately in love with him. But, at the same time, there is something very peculiar about him -- something lacking, but it is impossible to foresee precisely what will be lacking in any given instance, for the defect seems infinitely variable.
NAPOLEON	You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back. When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
ALEXANDER	Fascinating! Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
NAPOLEON	Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present. Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack. Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said. "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest." And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
ALEXANDER	Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
NAPOLEON	What do you mean?
ALEXANDER	I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
NAPOLEON	That is a problem, and I can appreciate your feelings. But I'm sure you have great talent for war, and I could teach you a lot. If we are ever at war again together, you should lead, say, 30,000 men, under my orders -- you would soon get the feel of it.
TALLEYRAND	Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
NAPOLEON	Does she deserve anything better?
TALLEYRAND	Those are extremely harsh terms.
NAPOLEON	I did not ask her to go to war against me.
TALLEYRAND	Has Alexander agreed to this?
NAPOLEON	Yes, he has.
TALLEYRAND	Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
NAPOLEON	That is correct.
TALLEYRAND	Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
NAPOLEON	I very seriously doubt it. I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy. With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse. More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
TALLEYRAND	England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria. A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
NAPOLEON	We have a treaty with Austria.
TALLEYRAND	Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
NAPOLEON	My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France. It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties. The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
TALLEYRAND	What I am talking about is moderation.
NAPOLEON	What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
TALLEYRAND	And where do you place Alexander?
NAPOLEON	Alexander and I are friends. We have reached an understanding.
TALLEYRAND	I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments. He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity. You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
NAPOLEON	That is a matter of opinion.
TALLEYRAND	Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
NAPOLEON	He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
NAPOLEON	My dear Alexander, between us there must never be any third parties. We must always deal directly with each other and never allow Ministers or advisors to muddy the waters.
NAPOLEON	The political interests of my monarchy, and the wishes of my people, require that I should transmit to an heir, the throne, on which providence has placed me. For many years, I have lost all hopes of having children by my beloved wife, the Empress Josephine. It is this consideration which induces me to sacrifice the dearest affections of my heart, to consult only the good of my subjects, and to desire the dissolution of our marriage.
JOSEPHINE	With the permission of my august and dear husband, I must declare that, retaining no hope of having children, who may satisfy the requirements of his policy in the interests of France, I have the pleasure of giving him the greatest proof of attachment and devotedness that was ever given on earth...
D'ANGELY	I respond to all the sentiments of the Emperor in consenting to the dissolution of a marriage which is now an obstacle to the happiness of France, be depriving it of the blessing of being, one day, governed by the descendants of that great man, who was evidently raised up by providence to efface the evils of a terrible revolution, and to restore the altar, the throne and social order.
NARRATOR	On the day after the divorce, Napoleon drove to Malmaison to visit with Josephine, and this visit was to set a pattern for all those to come. They were always announced in advance, there was something ceremonious and constrained about them, and they always left Josephine in a state of deep depression.
JOSEPHINE	My dearest Josephine -- I was heartsick at the sight of you yesterday. I, too, am sad today and need to know that you are more composed. This great palace echoes with emptiness and I feel terribly isolated. I am dinning all alone tonight. The page I sent to Malmaison this morning tells me he saw you weeping. You promised me you would stop. I want very much to come to see you but you will have to show more self-control.
JOSEPHINE	Sometimes I have the feeling that I am dead, and that the only sign of life remaining to me is the vague sensation that I no longer exist.
DUROC	Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
SCHWARZENBURG	Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
DUROC	Indeed you have, Ambassador. Have you sent for a doctor?
SCHWARZENBURG	Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
DUROC	I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
SCHWARZENBURG	Oh?
DUROC	The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
SCHWARZENBURG	What is that?
DUROC	refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again. For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
SCHWARZENBURG	But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
DUROC	No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
SCHWARZENBURG	But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna? I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
DUROC	May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors. Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
FRANCIS II	I grant my daughter's hand to the Emperor of the French.
MARIE-LOUISE	I, with my father's permission, give my consent to my union with the Emperor Napoleon.
CAROLINE	On arriving, the Empress Marie- Louise will ascend the steps on the north side, and the Emperor Napoleon will use those on the south side. The monarchs will arrive at the middle simultaneously. Upon perceiving the Emperor, the Empress will kneel and bow her head, and the Emperor will raise and embrace her.
NAPOLEON	Good evening, ladies. You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
MARIE-LOUISE	Oh, then you are...
NAPOLEON	Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
NAPOLEON	My dear, sweet Marie-Louis, you are even more beautiful than your portrait.
MARIE-LOUISE	And, where did you see my portrait?
NAPOLEON	Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
NAPOLEON	I hope you will forgive me for any inconveniences I may have caused you, and your family, in the past.
NAPOLEON	And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
MARIE-LOUISE	You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
NAPOLEON	Good! Good! Then we are both pleased with each other. How fortunate we are -- eh? How fortunate we are!
MARIE-LOUISE	Do you like music?
NAPOLEON	Yes, I do -- very much.
MARIE-LOUISE	Will I be able to play the harp? It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
NAPOLEON	Of course, my dear.
MARIE-LOUISE	You are so good to me. Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
NAPOLEON	You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
MARIE-LOUISE	I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views. I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
NAPOLEON	I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
MARIE-LOUISE	I hope you have patience with me. I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
NAPOLEON	I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
MARIE-LOUISE	Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here? I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
NAPOLEON	Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her. And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
MARIE-LOUISE	Oh, no, I am very happy. But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know. And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
NAPOLEON	Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
MARIE-LOUISE	Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
NAPOLEON	Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything. I will teach you everything that you must know.
NAPOLEON	Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
MARIE-LOUISE	No.
NAPOLEON	Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
NAPOLEON	At the door, one of them loses his nerve and decides to wait in the street while his more adventuresome friend goes inside. Fifteen minutes later his friend comes out.
NAPOLEON	"Well, what was it like?" the timid one asks. "Oh," his friend nonchalantly replied, "The movements are ridiculously simple, but the feeling is wonderful!"
MARIE-LOUISE	Blow out the candle, please.
JOSEPHINE	Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last. I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
MONTESQUIOU	I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness. And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
JOSEPHINE	Oh... I see. I understand. How is... the Emperor?
MONTESQUIOU	I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
JOSEPHINE	Ah, that is good.
MONTESQUIOU	And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
JOSEPHINE	Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
JOSEPHINE	My dear sweet child, one day, perhaps you will know the sacrifice I have made for you, and I leave it to your governess to make you aware of it. My adorable papa, I can announce to you that your prophesy has been realized. I am as happy as possible. My husband loves me profoundly and I return his affection. I feel sure that I shall live happily with him. I assure you, my dear papa, that the Emperor is as careful of my health as you would be.
MAJOR FIDON	Stop the carriage!
MAJOR FIDON	Good day, monsieur. Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
MAJOR FIDON	Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
MAJOR FIDON	May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
MAJOR FIDON	If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
MAJOR FIDON	Insolent bastard! Insolent bastard!
NARRATOR	By 1810, relations between France and Russia were wearing thin. The terms Russia had agreed to at Tilsit, three years earlier, were proving to be unrealistic and ruinous to her.
ALEXANDER	It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
CAULAINCOURT	But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally. Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
ALEXANDER	My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live. Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live. He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
CAULAINCOURT	I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy. He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
ALEXANDER	It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered. Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet. And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you? You have had to rule with an iron hand. You have turned friends into enemies. And even at that, the result has only been partly effective. You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials. But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance. You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
CAULAINCOURT	I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause? It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
ALEXANDER	My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit. I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
ALEXANDER	Caulaincourt, my father was strangled in his bed by his own Palace Guard. Can you blame me for not wishing to meet the same end?
CAULAINCOURT	Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador. But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
ALEXANDER	I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it. If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
NAPOLEON	Monsieur Barbier, I would like to have all the books, that are best worth consulting, on the topography of Russia, and especially of Lithuania, with special attention to the rivers, forests, roads, marshes and so forth. I would also like to have the most detailed account there is of Charles XII's campaigns in Poland and Russia.
NARRATOR	The seeds of the Russian campaign of 1812 were planted at Tilsit, in 1807, and began to bear fruit in 1810, when Alexander reopened his ports to British goods and imposed high tariffs on French imports. From then on, the situation between France and Russia steadily began to deteriorate -- friction grew, accusations were exchanged, spasmodic negotiations were attempted, tension increased and extensive military preparations were carried out by both sides.
NARRATOR	Napoleon had made up his mind that a showdown with Russia was inevitable. Dresden was appointed as a mutual rendezvous for all the Kings, Princes, Dukes and dependent royalties of every description, who were subordinates to Napoleon, or who hoped for good or evil at his hands. And it was here, on May 16, 1812, where for the last time he would appear as King of Kings.
NAPOLEON	Since my marriage, some people have said the lion has been sleeping -- they will now see whether he has been sleeping.
NARRATOR	The Emperor of Austria, with his Empress, had come to honor his mighty son-in-law. But he had already written to Alexander that the Treaty just signed with France should not, he hoped, prevent Russia and Austria from continuing their secret understanding, relative to their common political views.
NARRATOR	The King of Prussia also came to pay his respects. He had already written to Alexander, excusing himself for having yielded to irresistible force and fatality. "If war breaks out, we shall harm each other only as much as is strictly necessary, remembering constantly that we are one, that we must one day be allies again."
NAPOLEON	Never was the success of an expedition more certain. I see on all sides nothing but probabilities in my favor. For the first time, I advance at the head of the combined forces of France, Austria, Italy, Germany, the Confederation of the Rhine, and Poland.
EMPEROR FRANCIS	Let us hope that just the sight of our preparations will cause Alexander to yield.
NAPOLEON	That is my fervent hope. I love Alexander, as a brother, and wish him no harm.
FREDERICH WILHELM	If war should come, Alexander has sworn he will not make peace under any conditions, however many battles he may lose, using the size of his country, the poverty of the soil and the rigors of the climate, to wear you down.
NAPOLEON	I know he has said that, and I am sure that he would like to believe it's true. But Russia is a semi- Asiatic nation which cannot field an army as large as your own, and has no literature or music to speak of. It is a barbarian nation, and barbarians are superstitious and have simple ideas. A single blow delivered at the heart of the Russian Empire, at Moscow the Great, Moscow the Holy, will, in a single instant, put this whole blind apathetic mass into despair.
NAPOLEON	I know Alexander. His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
NARRATOR	With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
NAPOLEON	Well, this is an ill-omen, indeed. Caesar would probably turn back.
NARRATOR	The campaign of 1812 was the first time in which Napoleon had a marked superiority of numbers, but in accumulating such a mass of uneven quality, he would defeat his object, which was to bring about another Austerlitz or Friedland.
NARRATOR	The disparity of numbers left the Russians no option but to avoid battle and repeatedly disengage, however much political pressure developed for them to stand and fight.
rear guard cavalry setting light to the deserted	
NARRATOR	Alexander gave orders that his retiring army should blow up bridges behind them, destroy the cities and villages, remove all the necessities of life, and leave behind them, nothing but a desert waste.
NARRATOR	Although the Russians refused any major encounters, there was fierce fighting between the French advance guard and the Russian rear guard.
Russian officer commanding the cavalry rides up to	
NARRATOR	The Tsar's scorched earth strategy was in line with the views of some of the more enlightened Russian strategists, but the army and the people were full of reckless confidence and impatience for battle, and the long retreat to Moscow filled them with bitterness and a sense of feebleness and incompetence at the top.
NARRATOR	As Napoleon approached Moscow, the court of St. Petersburg was in despair, and the Tsar, his resolve shaken, was ready to sue for peace. Now, the intervention of one man, Count Feodor Vasilievitch Rostopchin, the Governor of Moscow, would have a decisive effect on the course of history.
ROSTOPCHIN	My friends, I have it now on excellent authority that the French will enter Moscow within a few days. Kutusov still swears he will fight to the death, but I have learned, on excellent authority, he has plans to surrender the city without a struggle. Our empire is almost overthrown. The court of St. Petersburg trembles, and will begin peace negotiations as soon as Napoleon enters the Kremlin. One can only imagine what will be lost. My friends, we are living in a time when men of conviction must be prepared to influence the nation even without the approval of their sovereign. They must dare to evaluate the public and private interests which they may be called upon a sacrifice.
ROSTOPCHIN	The flames of our beloved Moscow will erect a barrier of fire between the Tsar and all weakness, and they will rob from Napoleon the end and the aim of his campaign.
ROSTOPCHIN	Is there anyone who wishes to withdraw?
ROSTOPCHIN	Very well -- there is a great deal to be organized.
NAPOLEON	It was all very well for Alexander to do more damage to his country than I could possibly do, but he could not destroy Moscow. This is the prize that will end the war. You will see, we will have peace offerings from him within a few days.
DRUM-MAJOR	Hello, grandfather. Are you the only welcome we shall have today?
NAPOLEON	What do you want?
NAPOLEON	My God...! What time is it?
DUROC	Four o'clock.
NAPOLEON	My God, what a fire!
NAPOLEON	When did it start?
DUROC	The first reports came in at about ten.
NAPOLEON	Why didn't you wake me then?
DUROC	At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
NAPOLEON	How did it spread so quickly?
DUROC	It is the work of incendiaries.
NAPOLEON	I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
DUROC	Our troops have no part in this. It has been started by the Russians!
NAPOLEON	Impossible, I don't believe it.
DUROC	We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago. They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
NAPOLEON	But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
DUROC	From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city. The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
NAPOLEON	My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
ALEXANDER	Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
GENERAL KUTUSOV	Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
ALEXANDER	I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
ALEXANDER	General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
ALEXANDER	Proceed.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation. The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
ALEXANDER	You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
ALEXANDER	Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about. Please go on.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
ALEXANDER	For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
ALEXANDER	Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length. Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring. Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
ALEXANDER	I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
ALEXANDER	Ah, yes -- proceed.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring! I don't think he can afford to.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	It would be a sensible decision if he were merely commander of the army, but he is also the Emperor of France. Can he afford to stay away from Paris for what will amount to a year by the time he commences his campaign again in the spring? And, even if he might consider this, his lines of communication are over- stretched and vulnerable -- they can be easily cut by our cossacks. Will he then be willing to remain, completely out of touch with Paris -- for a year? The French are like women. You cannot stay away from them for too long.
ALEXANDER	Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this. Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
ALEXANDER	Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me. This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I. Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
ALEXANDER	I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads. Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
ALEXANDER	Proceed.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow. When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty. When Berlin fell, another treaty. That has always been the rules of the game. But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming? He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
ALEXANDER	What do you think Napoleon will do?
GENERAL KUTUSOV	I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter. In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris. But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat. But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe. If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
ALEXANDER	General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them. I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
GENERAL KUTUSOV	I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
NARRATOR	Day after day of fine autumn weather was allowed to slip away, while Napoleon waited for the word from Alexander which would never come. The weather was so fine and the temperature so mild that it seemed as if even the season was conspiring to deceive Napoleon.
NARRATOR	His troops fraternized with the enemy and reported them demoralized, and tired of war.
NARRATOR	Trunks, bearing dispatches and mail, arrived regularly every day from Paris. It seemed as easy to travel from Paris to Moscow as from Paris to Marseilles.
NARRATOR	Thus, lulled by events, and by realities he could not face, Napoleon seemed to fall into a dream in Moscow, and, amid the dreadful storm of men and element gathering around him, he spent his time discussing the merits of some new verses which he had received, or the regulations for the Comedie Francaise in Paris which took him three evenings to prepare.
NARRATOR	Napoleon was extremely superstitious and retained a mystical belief in his partnership with fate, a sense that he could only do so much, and that events must somehow complete the decision. And, so it would be in Moscow, where, without confidence and full of apprehension, he would cheerlessly pursue his destiny, unaware that fortune, which had so often smiled upon him, had now abandoned his cause just when he required miracles of her.
NARRATOR	It was not until October 20, that Napoleon withdrew the Grand Army from Moscow, to begin their thousand mile march into oblivion.
NARRATOR	He had waited too long. But the execution of his army would not be principally caused by cold or battle, but be starvation.
NARRATOR	In order to feed the army in the barren and ravaged wasteland through which it had to march, it was necessary to send large foraging parties deep into the surrounding countryside, protected by strong escorts of French cavalry, against the clouds of Cossacks which flanked and followed the march.
NARRATOR	But, by November 5, the temperature was down to 30-degrees of frost, and 30,000 French horses were dead. They were not bred to endure such cold and, not being properly shod for ice, had no chance to survive in these conditions.
NARRATOR	The cavalry was now on foot and it was a simple matter for the hordes of Cossack cavalry to confine the retreating French to their single road, thus transforming the finest army the world had ever seen into a starving, feverish mob, without purpose. General Famine and General Winter, rather than Russian bullets, would conquer the French.
DIDIER	Hello there, Picart.
PICART	Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
DIDIER	Why are you carrying the dog?
PICART	His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
DIDIER	When you eat him, may I have some?
PICART	My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog? I would rather eat Cossack.
NARRATOR	On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded. Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time. The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
NAPOLEON (V.O.)	A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us. Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
French townspeople gather around a courier reading	
NARRATOR	All around him, the sands were giving way, but Napoleon struck back with a brilliance which caused Wellington, much later on, to remark: "The study of the campaign has given me a greater idea of his genius than any other." For two months, Napoleon's small army would bedevil the jittery and uncoordinated allied armies by rapid marches and surprise attacks on their flanks and rear.
NARRATOR	During much of the fighting, a peace conference took place at Chatillon, where both sides insincerely raised and lowered their terms with the ebb and flow of the fighting.
NARRATOR	But despite the brilliance of his tactics, Napoleon's numbers dwindled and, in desperation, he made a daring and imaginative decision to move eastward, placing himself in the rear of the allied armies. This would cut their long lines of communication but, at the same time, leave open the road to Paris. Napoleon counted on Joseph fulfilling his orders for the defense of the city, so that, if the allies took the bait and marched on Paris, it would offer Napoleon an opportunity for a decisive victory.
NARRATOR	But on March 10th, the Tsar received a note from Talleyrand, revealing the total lack of military preparations in Paris.
NARRATOR	On March 23rd, allied patrols captured a courier carrying a letter from Napoleon to Marie-Louise in which he rashly revealed his plans.
NARRATOR	Although Alexander realized it was essential for Paris to surrender within 24 hours, to avoid the allies being trapped between the walls of Paris and Napoleon's forces which might attack his rear, he chose to gamble, persuading his generals to ignore Napoleon and march on Paris. This crucial decision would bring down Napoleon's empire.
NAPOLEON	Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy?
BELLIARD	They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
NAPOLEON	And where is the army?
BELLIARD	It is on this road, sire, following me.
NAPOLEON	And who is defending Paris?
BELLIARD	Paris is evacuated, sire. The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
NAPOLEON	Paris has surrendered?! I don't believe it.
BELLIARD	Unhappily, it is true, sire.
NAPOLEON	But where are my wife and son? What's become of them? Where is Marmont? Where is Mortier?
BELLIARD	The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet. Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
NAPOLEON	Well, you've heard what Belliard says, gentlemen -- come, I am going to Paris. Caulaincourt, have my carriage brought up. Come, come, Belliard, turn your men around.
CAULAINCOURT	But, Your Majesty, we cannot go to Paris now. There are no troops left there.
NAPOLEON	No troops? The National Guard is still there -- they will follow me. Things may yet be put right.
BELLIARD	But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked. The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men. Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
NAPOLEON	A treaty? Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this? Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
BELLIARD	I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
NAPOLEON	But who made this treaty?
BELLIARD	I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont. I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day. Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
NAPOLEON	Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
BELLIARD	I don't know, sire.
NAPOLEON	And where is Joseph?
BELLIARD	I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
NAPOLEON	What cowardice! What treason! Joseph has ruined everything. How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
CAULAINCOURT	But, sire, we mustn't risk turning Paris into another Moscow.
NAPOLEON	There seems little enough danger of that. Come! Come! My carriage! The troops!
NARRATOR	In defeat, Napoleon would be punished by the Kings of Europe, according to a standard which they would not have applied to each other. He might marry the niece of Marie Antoinette, and call himself an Emperor, but that did not make him one.

NARRATOR	The treaty of Fontainebleau of April 11th, 1814, signed by the allies and Napoleon, in return for his abdication from the throne of France, gave him the token sovereignty of the tiny island of Elba, with the title of Emperor, a yearly income of 2 million francs, an army of 700, and a navy of 3 ships. But in ten months time, even this tiny stake would be sufficient capital to bring this most reckless of all gamblers back into the game for a final, breathtaking spin of the wheel.
NARRATOR	After the solitude and semi- banishment of the last four years, Josephine found herself again at the center of Paris society. There would be a crush of crowned and coroneted heads at Malmaison, led by Tsar Alexander. But Josephine's final conquest would be pathetically brief -- in two weeks, she was to die of pneumonia.
ALEXANDER	How delightful it must have been this spot to Napoleon. Could he but pass his life here with you, Madame, he would have nothing to complain of but the too rapid slide of time.
JOSEPHINE	He loved Malmaison. I think it was the only place he was ever happy and carefree.
ALEXANDER	The fall of a great man is a sad sight to behold... He treated me badly but, even in my religion did not not forbid me to bear malice, I would bear him none. I am a better friend of his than he may know.
JOSEPHINE	You were the only monarch for whom he had both affection and respect.
ALEXANDER	It was I who secured the sovereignty of Elba for him, at a time when treachery and desertion of his own followers left him at the mercy of those who would have done much worse to him.
JOSEPHINE	I am certain you still hold his affection and gratitude. I believe he is only bitter about the desertions to his cause of those who were closest to him -- most particularly, the Marshals. He thought that, by giving them titles and making them rich, he would ensure their loyalty -- but in the end, they thought only of saving their titles and estates.
ALEXANDER	Madame, I hope you will allow me to discuss a matter which I fear may be distasteful to you at the present time, but which, in fairness to yourself and to your children, I feel I must -- and that is the subject of your own properties and pensions.
JOSEPHINE	Oh?
ALEXANDER	Let me be as good a friend to you as Napoleon ever was. If you will but command me, I shall secure all that is due to you and your children -- and even more, should you so desire.
NAPOLEON	Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
BERTRAND	It is a terrible shock.
NAPOLEON	But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
BERTRAND	I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
NAPOLEON	She should have had Larrey or Corvisart. They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me? Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper? How incredible!
BERTRAND	That is incredible.
NAPOLEON	Ah, my poor Josephine. She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world. She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
BERTRAND	I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
NAPOLEON	I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I? She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
NAPOLEON	She made me very unhappy when we were first married, but when we are young we become addicted to the pain of love and, once having experienced it, never want to be cured. For afterwards, we dread the horrible solitude of the heart, the emptiness of feeling...
NAPOLEON	Look at this -- how incredible! My last souvenir -- a bill I received just two weeks ago from her couturier -- 6,000 francs...!
NAPOLEON	Now I have lost everything that is precious to me. My dearest wife has been locked away by her father, and my poor baby grows up without me.
NARRATOR	Marie-Louise would prove to be a little more than a dull, commonplace, sensual girl, accustomed to obey the dictates of her father, who easily dissuaded her from joining Napoleon, and carefully chose instead as her aide-de-camp, the gallant and dashing General Neipperg, who soon became her lover. They would have two children together before Napoleon's death.
NARRATOR	Napoleon would never see his son again, and the child would grow up in gilded isolation, melancholy, ignored by his mother, in chronic ill-health and haunted by the legend of this father. He would die at the age of 22.
NARRATOR	When Louis XVIII returned to Paris in 1814, he was as unknown in France as an Egyptian Pharaoh. Marked by clumsiness and disdain, he quickly proved that the Bourbon dynasty had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. People said that he did not return to the throne of his ancestors but simply ascended the throne of Bonaparte. By 1815, the army and the people were ready to rise against him and welcome the return of Napoleon.
NARRATOR	Napoleon set sail, from Elba, on February 26th, 1815, with his small force of 700 soldiers, while the governor of the island, Sir Neil Campbell, was away in Florence. He put his soldiers to work writing out his proclamations in long hand.
AIDE	General Cannet presents his compliments to the Emperor, and requests that he lay down his arms and surrender himself and his men.
NAPOLEON	Thank you, Colonel. Please present my compliments to General Cannet, and tell him that I shall come presently and bring the answer myself.
GENERAL CANNET	Bonaparte is on his way to attempt to illegally reestablish himself over the legitimate government of our King, Louis XVIII. It is our responsibility, as loyal soldiers of France, to prevent him from doing this, by whatever means are necessary. His force numbers less than 700 men.
VOICES	What about us -- don't we count?
NAPOLEON	Hello, men of the 5th -- do you recognize your Emperor?
VOICES	Yes!
NAPOLEON	I recognize you -- we are old friends. I know you from Friedland and Borodino. And, you there, Sergeant Monestier, how are you?
NAPOLEON	My good friends, I am told that Marshal Ney has promised the King to bring me back to Paris in an iron cage. I have sent word to my old friend, Marshal Ney, that he can make that a wooden box, if he is able to manage it, but I certainly must refuse an iron cage -- I'm not as young as I used to be, and I can't accept such drafty accommodations!
NAPOLEON	Men of the 5th, your general has invited me to surrender myself and my men, but I come to make you an offer -- Men of the 5th, will you join me?
NAPOLEON	I shall have to send a message to Louis VXIII, in Paris, and tell him not to send any more troops -- I have enough already.
NARRATOR	After the dizzying magic of the return, came a sense of disenchantment -- and some anxious second thoughts. The allies had quickly patched up the differences that had divided them for almost a year, at the Congress of Vienna, and on which Napoleon had counted to give him some breathing space. To make matters worse, they refused to have any diplomatic dealings, declaring him a criminal beyond the protection of the law.
VALET	Excuse me, Your Majesty.
NAPOLEON	Yes?
VALET	Madame Avrillon has arrived, sire.
NAPOLEON	Oh -- where is she?
VALET	I have shown her to your bedroom, Your Majesty.
NAPOLEON	Please ask her to get undressed, and tell her I'll be along as soon as I can.
VALET	Yes, sire.
NARRATOR	The allies were preparing to move on the frontiers of France with more than a million men. Strung along the Belgian frontier was an army of 100,000 English and German troops, under Wellington, separated by ten miles from a force of 120,000 Prussian troops, under Blucher. Napoleon calculated the huge Russian and Austrian armies could not reach his Eastern frontiers before July. This gave him the opportunity to use a favorite tactic and strike quickly against Wellington and Blucher, hoping to defeat them separately, before they could unite their forces. On June 16th, Blucher was defeated at Ligny, and Wellington was forced to retreat from Quatre Bras, but neither victory was decisive, nor were they followed up as they should have been, due to Napoleon becoming ill, and to mistakes by his generals. But what would prove disastrous for Napoleon, was that he believed the Prussians to be out of the battle for good, and retreating away from Wellington, whereas Blucher, still full of fight, was marching north to join him.
NARRATOR	On the morning of June 18th, Napoleon, with 74,000 men faced Wellington with 67,000, on a battlefield near the village of Mount St. Jean, ten miles south of Brussels. Confident that the Prussians were out of action, or contained by Grouchy's pursuing cavalry, Napoleon's only fear was that Wellington would retreat.
NARRATOR	But Wellington had decided to fight it out, on Blucher's assurance that at least one Prussian corps would reach him by mid-day. He had chosen his favorite defensive position, on a rise, where the reverse slopes would shelter his infantry from plunging artillery fire.
NARRATOR	Napoleon was in no hurry to start the battle and he waited until mid- day to allow the ground to dry, so that his heavy guns could get into position. This was to prove to be a crucial mistake. Had the battle begun at day-break, Wellington would probably have been defeated before the Prussians intervened.
NARRATOR	Napoleon ignored the warning of his Peninsular war generals about the fire-power of the English infantry, and decided on a frontal attack on the center, preceded by an attack on the Hougoumont farmhouse, which anchored the English right flank.
NARRATOR	In the opening moves of the battle, the French could not dislodge the English from the Hougoumont farm.
GENERAL SIMON	I think it is only some dust blowing.
GENERAL MARCHADIER	I though for a moment, then, that I could just make out the color of French uniforms.
GENERAL SIMON	Yes -- a bit of blue and red. I thought so, too.
GENERAL LABESSE	Let us hope it is Marshal Grouchy.
GENERAL MARCHADIER	How far away do you make it?
GENERAL SIMON	I should say, five or six miles.
GENERAL MARCHADIER	At least that.
GENERAL SIMON	I thought for a moment I could make out the colors of Prussian uniforms. What do you think?
NARRATOR	At 12:30 pm, the column approaching on the right flank was identified as Prussian. Napoleon could have called off the battle at this point, but the campaign would have been lost, and he preferred the chance of smashing Wellington before the Prussians could arrive in strength.
NARRATOR	Had Marshal Grouchy maintained aggressive contact with the retreating Prussians, they would have been prevented from entering the battle. Having failed to do this, had he now marched his 34,000 men to the sound of the guns, he would have increased Napoleon's army by fifty percent and would most probably have ensured a French victory. But this was not to be, and Grouchy's inadequacies would be the ruin of Napoleon's last battle.
NARRATOR	With Grouchy's force out of the battle, and the Prussians moving against his flank, Napoleon was in a strategically compromised position, but there was still time to achieve a tactical triumph on the battlefield before the Prussians arrived.
NARRATOR	But Napoleon was painfully ill, and spent most of the day three-quarters of a mile behind the battle.
NARRATOR	He left the tactical handling of the battle entirely to Marshal Ney, who, having deserted Napoleon the year before at Fontainebleau, was the only one of that group of Marshals who had since then reconciled with him. Berthier had committed suicide when he heard of Napoleon's return from Elba, and Ney's eleventh hour switch of allegiance to Napoleon, had left his soldier's mind in a clouded and uneasy state. He would now make tactical blunder after blunder, while gallantly rushing around the battlefield like a young subaltern.
NARRATOR	At 1:30, Ney launched the first main attack, when four densely massed infantry columns, unsupported by cavalry or horse artillery, were repulsed with heavy loss.
NARRATOR	At 3:30 pm, Ney misinterpreted movements in the English line as signs of a general retreat and, now, blundered again, sending in the cavalry alone, unsupported by infantry.
NARRATOR	After two hours of savage fighting, the British infantry had learned that when the French cavalry were close, the artillery stopped. And they also realized that each time they fired a volley, the cavalry would try to break through them, before they could reload. So they stopped firing.
NARRATOR	By 6 pm, Napoleon had entered into the battle himself and was forced to commit 14,000 men of his general reserve to hold up Bulow's Prussians.
NARRATOR	At 7:30 pm, Napoleon released 5 battalions of the guard reserve for Ney's final assault. When this failed, the French morale cracked.
NARRATOR	Wellington put in his cavalry, and the French army broke in panic and ran.
NEY	Come on -- follow me and see how a Marshal of France dies!
NARRATOR	But Ney would survive the battle to be shot for treason by the returning monarchy.
NARRATOR	Napoleon escaped from France where he might have met the same fate, and surrendered to the English, hoping for a congenial exile in Britain. But he was sent as a prisoner to the tiny island of St. Helena, in the South Atlantic, a thousand miles from the nearest land. He would live out the last five years of his life there, amid the petty squabbles of his own entourage, and his captors.
NARRATOR	His house was a hastily rebuilt collection of buildings originally constructed as cattle-sheds.
NARRATOR	His four constricted rooms were infested with rats. His food and wine, and opened mail were subjects of continuous dispute.
NARRATOR	His walks were so closely guarded that he eventually gave them up altogether.
NARRATOR	His gaoler, Sir Hudson Lowe, was a weak, narrow-minded, and petty man, obsessed with the fear his prisoner would escape, though a squadron of ten ships, and a garrison of 3,000 men guarded the island.
NARRATOR	His final illness would, until the very end, be dismissed by English doctors as a diplomatic disease.
NAPOLEON	Who is there?
BERTRAND	Bertrand, sire.
NAPOLEON	I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
BERTRAND	Yes, sire?
NAPOLEON	She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
BERTRAND	No, sire... I was asleep.
NAPOLEON	I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
NARRATOR	Napoleon died on May 5, 1821. Hudson Lowe insisted the inscription on the tomb should read "Napoleon Bonaparte." Montholon and Bertrand refused anything but the Imperial title -- "Napoleon." In the end, it was left nameless. Production Notes Location exteriors Yugoslavia Location interiors Italy Front projection Yugoslavia
