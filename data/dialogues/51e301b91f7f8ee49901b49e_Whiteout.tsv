CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain	CONTINUED:
WOMAN (O.C.)	...Yeah?
JAMIE	Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein needs to see you in biology. Said it's urgent.
CARRIE	Alright -- CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Hey Fred, unlock any secrets of the Universe -- discover we're Alien life forms?
FRED	Workin' on it.
CARRIE	Which one's Sapperstein?
SCIENTIST	Deschampsia Antarctica.
CARRIE	Okay, thanks. Sapperstein?
SAPPERSTEIN	Yeah.
CARRIE	Wanted to see me?
SAPPERSTEIN	-- Follow me.
SAPPERSTEIN (cont'd)	They took it all.
CARRIE	All what?
SAPPERSTEIN	Cannabis Sativa.
SAPPERSTEIN (cont'd)	My weed, man. I've been growing it all summer and they took it. It was just budding, too. It's not funny!
CARRIE	Professor Sapperstein, I'd like you to read something for me.
CARRIE (cont'd)	What's this say?
CARRIE (cont'd)	C'mon, go ahead, read it.
SAPPERSTEIN	Carrie Stetko.
CARRIE	Keep reading.
SAPPERSTEIN	United States Marshal.
CARRIE	Very good. Now are you still sure you want to report the theft of an illegal narcotic? Professor...are you planning on doing the winter-over?
SAPPERSTEIN	Not this year, no.
CARRIE	Good. And how are you feeling right now?
SAPPERSTEIN	You think I'm crazy? Is that what you're saying?
CARRIE	No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home? CONTINUED:
MURPHY (O.C.)	You busy?
CARRIE	What do you think? I know you weren't in the area. What's up?
MURPHY	I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he spotted a popsicle out on the ice.
CARRIE	What flavor?
MURPHY	Don't know.
CARRIE	And we were doing so well. Where?
MURPHY	McClain Valley.
CARRIE	McClain Valley? What was he doing out there? That's no man's land.
MURPHY	I've got a plane heading to ASB in an hour with some supplies for Winter-over. Can't get you back until tomorrow. You leaving the dart board?
CARRIE	No -- just the picture.
P	opulation: 183 Temperature: - 55Â°
CARRIE	Bottom of the frickin' planet.
CARRIE	Doc?
KELLER	Well, hello Marshal. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Keller. You seen Doc?
KELLER	Out back. What are you doing here?
CARRIE	Checking the freezer for a popsicle.
KELLER	No shit?
CARRIE	It got called in this morning.
KELLER	Who spotted it?
CARRIE	Delfy, one of the pilots here.
KELLER	It's his first year down here. You know how that goes. My bet it was just debris, an old tent or something.
CARRIE	Yeah -- probably.
KELLER	Here's an idea -- why don't you stay here with me and we'll party, just the two of us. Put those cuffs of yours to work.
CARRIE	...Were you the second guy from the front?
KELLER	Yeah.
CARRIE	Not interested.
RHONDA	I'll have them boomerang back and pick up the load -- just have it ready.
TECH	Guys got the science lab all shut down.
RHONDA	Good, have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics, then clear the exterior storage bins. Make sure we're not leaving anything out there. Sam told me you'd be coming up -- how's the sleigh ride?
CARRIE	Fine. I need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle.
RHONDA	I'll have him meet you in the hangar. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Yeah, good.
DOC	In less than three days we begin Winter-over. The sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months. The sane ninety percent of the population will be leaving the ice. Extreme weather conditions make it impossible for planes from the outside world to land. You have chosen, for your own misguided reasons, to stay. And it is my responsibility to teach you beakers how not to die. Time?
ASIAN	T... T... Three minutes. CONTINUED:
DOC	Your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees. You are shivering uncontrollably -- losing basic motor skills. You're having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks. In short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been two-hundred seconds. Put your coats on. Your life is dependent on your awareness of the weather. So be aware. There is a condition that arises around here known as a whiteout. Don't get caught in it. Winds kick up snow that's lain on the ice for thousands of years -- can't see six inches in front of your nose. Temperature plummets to triple digits. We found bodies less than a foot from safety and warmth.
DOC (cont'd)	Class, here we have another of the many hazards found on Antarctica. Say hello to Marshal Stetko.
CLASS	Hello Marshal Stetko.
DOC	Always a pleasure to see you. Unlike most of the beaker-heads down here. Social visit?
CARRIE	I wish -- We got a job. I need you to take a ride with me. Might be a body out on the ice.
DOC	Why's this crap always happen at the end of the season? Too cold for driving.
CARRIE	So it is.
DOC	What's your gut say about this body?
CARRIE	My gut and I don't talk anymore. I saw your boxes packed up. What was all that BS last month about, "I'm never going back -- I'll die here. Scatter my ashes over the pole"?
DOC	People change, Carrie.
CARRIE	Not you. CONTINUED:
DOC	I got a card from my Granddaughter inviting me to her fifth birthday party. You know, I've never even met her.
CARRIE	Or mentioned her. A grandchild? Doc, that's great.
DOC	It got me thinking -- I need to be a better Grandfather, than I was a father. It's time I deal with my life. I've been down here a lot longer than I probably should have.
CARRIE	You Delfy?
DELFY	Yes, ma'am.
DOC	Where the hell they get these thumb-suckers?
DELFY	Brooklyn. And unless your wrinkled ass has a heart attack on my plane, I think we'll be all right.
DOC	-- I want Keller. He's my pilot. Keller, get over here!
CARRIE	Delfy's taking us, Doc. He's the one who saw the body. C'mon, you'll be fine. I'll even hold your hand if you want.
CARRIE	What were you doing out there?
DELFY	I went to evac a camp. Had to fly off route to get around a storm. Got down low to avoid some turbulence, and there it was.
CARRIE	That your son?
DELFY	Yeah, name's Nathan.
CARRIE	He's cute. Has your eyes.
DELFY	Lucky he got his momma's brain. Kid's smart.
CARRIE	So why aren't you with him?
DELFY	The bonus pay. Trying to buy a house. Give my boy a yard. His own room. Stuff I never had. CONTINUED: Don't like the cold, huh?
CARRIE	Hate it.
DELFY	Then why are you down here?
CARRIE	We all make stupid mistakes.
DELFY	It's right up here. I don't carry extra panties Doc, so keep it tight. There it is.
DELFY (cont'd)	Three o'clock.
CARRIE	Yeah. Got it. It's a popsicle alright. Red jacket. He's American. CONTINUED:
DOC	... It's always different when they freeze. Some curl up. Some stretch out. Some tear their clothes off. They get delirious. What was that guy's name?
CARRIE	Linger.
DOC	Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife, Janet. Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots.
DELFY	Jesus.
DOC	Never seen a dead guy? You know him --
CARRIE	So do you. Think his name's Weiss. We Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times.
DOC	The guy who cheated?
CARRIE	Yeah. Geologist, I think.
DOC	Damn -- Looks like he fell from up there.
CARRIE	Then where's his crampons -- his gear?
DOC	Maybe down the crevasse?
CARRIE	Yeah, maybe -- What's the closest camp?
DELFY	Brits -- about eighty miles west.
CARRIE	What the hell where you doing all the way out here?
DOC	Ah Christ -- he's a sticker.
CARRIE	You going to be alright?
DELFY	No -- this is the kind of stuff that scars you for life.
DOC	Gonna give myself a Goddamn hernia.
CARRIE	Oh yeah -- I'm really going to miss this place. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Who manages the Post Stations?
RHONDA	Dinkle. Howard Dinkle.
CARRIE (O.C.)	One - two - three... How long to thaw him out?
DOC	Carrie, let's just bag him and put him on a plane to McMurdo.
CARRIE	It bothers me no one's reported him missing yet.
DOC	Because maybe no one thinks he is.
CARRIE	How'd he get out there? There were no tracks.
DOC	Sounds to me like you and your gut are talking again. CONTINUED: Let's ask ourselves if we really need to do this.
CARRIE	Nobody wants to get out of here more than I do, trust me, but right now -- we're all this guy has.
CARRIE	Grab that side.
DOC	Stirring up a few things? CONTINUED:
CARRIE	...I'll be alright.
DOC	You know, this means a Federal Investigation, and we're witnesses. We may get stuck here.
CARRIE	I know.
DOC	We both want to do the right thing Carrie -- but we also need to get off the ice. Right now we don't have to say a word. When they find something later -- hey, we didn't know. We were leaving, the body was frozen, we didn't have time to examine it. No one gets murdered in Antarctica. Think about it. Dead is dead.
CARRIE	Exactly, this is the first murder in Antarctica, Doc -- and I can't just pretend it didn't happen. I'm sorry.
DOC	Why did I know you were going to say that?
MURPHY (V.O.)	What camp was he with?
CARRIE	I'm on my way to find out. This is all I need right now.
CARRIE	I'm sure his family's thinking the same thing.
MURPHY (V.O.)	That's not what I meant. I'll contact the FBI -- see how they want to handle this. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	I hate interrupting educational programming, but --
CARRIE (cont'd)	I need to talk to Dinkle.
LAST GUY	Marshal.
CARRIE	Chaplain.
DINKLE	Am I in some kind of trouble?
CARRIE	What are they doing out there? CONTINUED:
DINKLE	Collecting meteorites. One One has an extremely old surface with low sediment deposition.
CARRIE	English, please.
DINKLE	for meteorites. It's right here.
CARRIE	I don't get it -- Weiss was no where near Delta One One.
CARRIE (cont'd)	When are they scheduled for evac?
DINKLE	One sec -- ...They haven't arranged a pickup yet.
CARRIE	Isn't that a little unusual this close to Winter-over?
DINKLE	Yes, it is. Really unusual, actually. I guess I should've contacted them, but --
CARRIE	-- You've been a little busy. Yeah, I can see that. What's their frequency?
DINKLE	Seventeen.
CARRIE	Delta One One, this is United States Marshall Carrie Stetko, come back, over. Delta One One, I repeat, this is United States Marshal Stetko, come in, over. Stetko.
JAMIE (V.O.)	Marshal, it's Jamie. I've got some guy holding from Vostok who won't give his name, says he has to talk to you.
CARRIE	Vostok? Patch it through.
JAMIE (V.O.)	You're on now.
CARRIE	This is Marshal Stetko, who's this?
MOONEY (V.O.)	John Mooney.
CARRIE	Mooney? You know who I am?
CARRIE	What happened out there, Mooney? You come to Vostok and we'll talk. Only you.
CARRIE	Where's Rubin?
MOONEY (V.O.)	Come to Vostok.
CARRIE	Getting drunk already?
DOC	Just gearing my liver up in case I have to stay the next six months.
CARRIE	Murphy's contacting the Feds.
DOC	You're making my day. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	I'll do everything I can to get you off this ice, promise.
DOC	I know you will. What's the hurry?
CARRIE	Going to Vostok. One of the guys from Weiss' team called. Wants to talk.
DOC	What's he doing in Russia?
RHONDA	We're tracking it now.
CARRIE	I need a plane to Vostok.
RHONDA	I don't control the weather -- you want to stay the winter, then don't be ready for your evac. Sorry, can't. All the planes are committed. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	I'm not asking.
RHONDA	What am I supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half?
CARRIE	Tell them I took their plane.
SUPER: Vostok Station (Russian Federation)	
DELFY	What's with this place?
CARRIE	The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore. They have to barter with other bases for supplies. Some of these guys have been rotting here for years.
CARRIE	Who's in charge?
YURI	Who's asking?
CARRIE	Stetko, US Marshal. I'm here to talk to an American named Mooney.
YURI	So many people come through Vostok. Is hard to remember.
CARRIE	I figured.
YURI	Mister Mooney, yes. I remember now. He offers pay us to fly him off Antarctica on our transport. We give him very good price - because plane leaves a week ago!
CARRIE	Where is he? CONTINUED:
YURI	Red storm line.
DELFY	You don't carry a gun?
CARRIE	Against the law -- Antarctica's the only place in the world you can't have one. Part of the Treaty.
DELFY	Doesn't that make you feel kind of naked?
CARRIE	All this crap on -- I prefer naked.
DELFY	Gettin' worse. Minus eighty-one. Wind at a hundred and ten knots.
CARRIE	Do you have to do that in front of me?
DELFY	Give you a hand?
CARRIE	Sure. CONTINUED:
DELFY	Ever been on a rope-line in a whiteout?
CARRIE	Nope. Thoughts?
DELFY	Yeah, hold on tight.
CARRIE	Mooney? Hello? Mooney? CONTINUED:
CARRIE	...My God. CONTINUED: CONTINUED: CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Jack? Jack!
DELFY O.C.	Wo wo wo. It's okay, it's okay. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	What happened?
DELFY	When you didn't come back -- we went looking for you. Found a dead guy in the other building -- that Mooney?
CARRIE	Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then went after me. How long was I out?
DELFY	A couple hours. He's been looking after you.
CARRIE	Thanks. I need to get back in there.
DELFY	Whoever it was, could have flown out after the storm broke. Who's Jack?
CARRIE	Let it go, Delfy.
DELFY	Until I met you, I hadn't seen any dead people. Now I'm at two. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Unless you want your head cracked, I wouldn't move.
MAN	Take it easy.
CARRIE	-- Let me see your hands. Now turn around.
CARRIE (cont'd)	Who are you? Delfy comes up behind her.
MAN	Robert Pryce. I'm a United Nations observer for the Oceanic and Antarctic section. If you relax, I've got my ID.
CARRIE	Let's see it -- slowly.
PRYCE	You must be Stetko -- I was heading to ASB to talk to you about Weiss when I was told you had come up here.
CARRIE	How do you know about Weiss?
PRYCE	FBI notified us. Your base commander called it in. I thought I might find answers in his gear, but there's nothing here but clothes.
CARRIE	This is part of a crime scene.
PRYCE	I realize that, but considering the time constraints we're up against, let's be honest, taping and bagging everything isn't going to be an option.
CARRIE	I'll be sure to let the U.N. know if I find out anything.
PRYCE	You heading out to Delta One One?
CARRIE	Maybe.
PRYCE	I'll grab my bag.
CARRIE	Don't take this personally, but I don't need your help.
PRYCE	If they've been digging out there, that's a direct violation of the United Nations treaty. We think they were digging. That makes it my business.
CARRIE	You don't dig for meteorites.
PRYCE	And you don't get killed for them either. This is now a U.N. matter. I am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if I have to.
DELFY	He can, you know.
CARRIE	Fine. But this is my investigation, understand? If you obstruct it in any way, I will have you detained.
PRYCE	Fine. Mind if I ask you a personal question?
CARRIE	No, but I have the feeling you're going to anyway.
PRYCE	Why do you smell like suntan lotion? CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Murphy, listen to me, it's got to be Rubin who tried to kill me. You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and McMurdo -- search for him.
MURPHY (V.O.)	That's not possible. We're still bringing people in and resupplying other bases for Winter-over.
CARRIE	Sam, I think these guys found something out there at the camp. I'm going to check it out. Until I find Rubin, no one leaves the ice. Not yet.
PRYCE	We ready?
CARRIE	Guess so. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	What time is it?
PRYCE	Two thirty.
CARRIE	A.M. or P.M.?
PRYCE	A.M.
CARRIE	Wonderful. I'll take this one.
CARRIE	Rubin? CONTINUED: Uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen
PRYCE	Anything?
CARRIE	Someone's left leg took a hit, lost a lot of blood. What do you got?
PRYCE	Their daily work log.
DELFY	Looks like my dad's old lawn mower.
PRYCE	It's ground penetrating radar.
CARRIE	Looks like they were surveying sections at a time.
PRYCE	Areas labeled?
CARRIE	Yeah -- CONTINUED:
PRYCE	At Sections 101 and 102, they spent one day. 103 two days. 104 -- seven days. That was a month ago.
CARRIE	Looks like they hit some really big meteors.
PRYCE	How far?
CARRIE	About four miles.
PRYCE	Let's go see what they found.
CARRIE	I want to check something out first. CONTINUED:
DELFY	I said "which way?"
CARRIE	North.
PRYCE	Hurt?
CARRIE	Yeah, a little.
PRYCE	How long have you been down here, Marshal? CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Almost two years.
PRYCE	What brought you to the ice?
CARRIE	The excitement, mostly.
PRYCE	Everyone down here is running away from something.
CARRIE	Some shrink tell you that?
PRYCE	Yeah, and that I should call my mother more often
CARRIE	And do you?
PRYCE	Every Sunday.
CARRIE	Where do you plant your boots?
PRYCE	They got me working out of Christchurch, New Zealand. Beautiful country. But this -- crazy place to make a living.
CARRIE	I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay.
PRYCE	He give you that ring I saw? Tell you he was going to marry you?
CARRIE	No -- just gave me a headache. I didn't see a ring on your finger.
PRYCE	Flattered that you even looked.
CARRIE	This is it. Stop.
DELFY	There's nothing here.
CARRIE	Just stop.
PRYCE	You sure this is right?
CARRIE	Section 104. These are the coordinates.
DELFY	Maybe you wrote them down wrong.
CARRIE	This is shaved ice. CONTINUED: They were digging, Pryce. And they tries to spread the ice to hide it. Grab me!
PRYCE	Hold my legs!
CARRIE	I'm slipping!
PRYCE	Almost got you.
CARRIE	I'm losing my grip.
PRYCE	Carrie? Can you hear me?
DELFY	Marshal? ...I'm okay.
DELFY	Saw a rope in the Cat. CONTINUED: Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at
CARRIE	Cargo plane, but I don't recognize it.
DELFY	It's an Antanov-74. Russian made - - late fifties. No one's put these in the air for forty years.
CARRIE	Guess that makes three.
Continues over three dead men in flight suits still	
DELFY	This isn't funny --
CARRIE	Where's Pryce?
CARRIE	What is that?
DELFY	Vodka.
CARRIE	Find what you're looking for?
PRYCE	Just answers. Those are fuel tanks behind you. This plane was outfitted for long range capabilities.
CARRIE	And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important. CONTINUED: Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this
PRYCE	They put some serious work into this.
CARRIE	Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel. What is that?
DELFY	It's the Cat!
CARRIE	Go!
DELFY	Sonofabitch!
CARRIE	No signal, you? Someone followed us.
PRYCE	This isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon. We're going to suffocate before we get out here.
CARRIE	How long do you figure we've got?
PRYCE	Three of us down here -- 12, 15 hours at the most.
DELFY	No way. I'm not going out like this. No way. CONTINUED: And when that one goes -- we're screwed.
CARRIE	What about the Vodka -- we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice?
PRYCE	Fire will burn the O2 quicker.
CARRIE	What choice do we have?
DELFY	Don't need my vote.
PRYCE	Hold these.
CARRIE	What're you doing?
PRYCE	All these planes used to have bail- out hatches.
CARRIE	We came in through it.
PRYCE (O.C.)	Has to be more than one.
DELFY	It'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing.
PRYCE	Found it! With the angle of the plane, I don't think we're that far from the surface. Give me a hand.
PRYCE (cont'd)	These are explosive bolts. If we blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash a hole up through the ice.
CARRIE	Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us.
PRYCE	We can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death. Take your pick. This could work -- give me the battery from your phone.
PRYCE (cont'd)	When I connect these two wires, hopefully there's going to be a big bang. May want to take some cover. You guys ready?
DELFY	Hallelujah --
PRYCE	Delfy, help me with this. We'll need to get up higher.
CARRIE	Don't move.
PRYCE	What's going on?
DELFY	Yeah -- what're you doing?
CARRIE	Our friend here isn't who he says he is. Didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here?
PRYCE	I've been authorized because of what's happened.
CARRIE	Stop lying to me --
CARRIE (cont'd)	Delfy, cuff him to the wall.
PRYCE	Don't do this.
DELFY	Man, the guy just saved our lives...
CARRIE	He was saving his own. Do it. You know what was in that safe. Now, who are you?
CARRIE (cont'd)	I swear I'll leave you here to die.
PRYCE	CIA.
CARRIE	Have you got an ID for that too?
PRYCE	Listen to me -- Forty eight hours ago, we picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahir Soufian, a black market trader in New York. It was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old Russian transport buried in the ice.
DELFY	Damn, I knew that government eavesdropping was true.
PRYCE	There's been rumors for years that the Russians had a second base -- a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties -- nothing was ever confirmed. The fact is, before the treaty in `72 they were strip mining all over the place down here -- we believe for uranium and other specialized minerals for weapon's use. It was the Cold War. No one knows half the things the Russian's were up to. This plane could be the link between rumor and truth. And if it is true, what's in those cannisters could be a prelude to another terrorist attack.
CARRIE	Why did you lie to me?
PRYCE	Look, the U.N. carries a lot of weight down here. Think about it - - if I had told you I was C.I.A., you would have been on the horn back to Washington in no time. This is a very sensitive matter. News travels fast down here, I don't have to tell you that. Besides, I didn't know if I could trust you.
DELFY	Keys are still in it!
Carrie notices a single set of an airplane's ski tracks	CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Plane could've gone anywhere. There's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over. Rubin could just disappear in the mayhem. Rhonda?
RHONDA (V.O.)	Where the hell are you?
CARRIE	Heading back. How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours? You expect me to --
CARRIE	-- How many?
RHONDA (V.O.)	Fifteen.
CARRIE	I need a list of names.
DELFY	You think Rubin might try to leave out of McMurdo?
CARRIE	He knows I'm on his ass, so he might. Anything's possible. I want to eliminate his options.
PRYCE (INTO PHONE)	Six cannisters, maybe four inches in diameter, about a foot high -- find out exactly what the Russians transported in something that size. You have a photo of Rubin anywhere?
CARRIE	Back at ASB --
PRYCE	How long to get there?
DELFY	When we get back to the plane, I'll get ya there in forty minutes.
PRYCE	I'll scan a picture of him and get it to you. Meanwhile, contact every non-American base down here and put them on watch. He's got some plan to get these off the ice.
CARRIE	I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One. He was dumped from a plane. CONTINUED:
PRYCE	You need to get that looked at.
CARRIE	I'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done.
DINKLE	Murphy's looking for you.
CARRIE	Murphy? What the hell is he doing HERE
DINKLE	Came in on the evac. Hey -- I don't turn that in, I have to pay for it.
CARRIE	I'm on 30 if you need me. Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk.
DINKLE	Make sure I get that back. CONTINUED:
PRYCE	Of course.
TECH	It's packing winds of a hundred thirty knots.
MURPHY	Shit -- we've got to move up the evac.
RHONDA	How much?
MURPHY	Six hours at least.
RHONDA	Jesus, I got crew that's still not in.
MURPHY	Then get them in!
CARRIE (O.C.)	You wanted to see me?
MURPHY	Where the hell have you been?
CARRIE	Buried under 2 tons of ice. You? CONTINUED:
MURPHY	Do me a favor, you find any more bodies, mind not parading them down the main corridor. I've got Newbies afraid to winterover, for Chirstsake. They want out on seats I don't have. And next time you want to take a Goddamn plane anywhere, you ask me.
CARRIE	Sure thing, Chief.
MURPHY	We don't have enough supplies for all of us to Winter-over if we get stuck down here. And you wonder why it didn't work out between us.
CARRIE	It didn't work, Sam, because you couldn't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here. I was stupid enough to be one of them. Now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that someone's out there with six cannisters, possibly full of Uranium, and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people. And I'm trying to stop it -- so fuck asking you for shit, Sam.
MURPHY	This is ridic---
DOC (O.C.)	Enough! What the hell's wrong with you, Murph? I've got bodies piling up in my lab, and she's the only one doing anything about it. Why don't you try helping her for a change?
CARRIE	You know what Doc, it's alright. You got my list?
DOC	I'm worried about you. Is it going to take another attempt on your life to get you to finally slow down?
CARRIE	You worry too much -- but it's what I like about you. Doc, did you notice if Weiss had a wound on his left leg? CONTINUED:
DOC	I striped him down to put him in a bodybag. There's only the puncture from the axe. No way, I would have noticed it. Why?
CARRIE	Then it's gotta be Rubin. I don't know.
DOC	Any word from the FBI?
CARRIE	There's no way they're gonna make it. Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula. Oh God.
DOC	Jesus, Carrie, how long did you let this go?
CARRIE	When did I go to Vostok?
DOC	Feel that?
CARRIE	No.
DOC	Now? I have to amputate your middle two fingers.
CARRIE	No way. Don't tell me that.
DOC	The fingers are dead, Carrie. If I don't do it now, gangrene will set in. You'll lose your hand.
DOC (cont'd)	I'm sorry.
DOC (O.C.)	There, finished. BACK TO SCENE It's going to be an adjustment. CONTINUED: Should ease the pain. I'll look around, dig some more up for you.
PRYCE	I stopped by the clinic... Doc told me.
CARRIE	Pretty tough Marshal, huh? If you came to propose, now's not really a good time. CONTINUED: Anything?
PRYCE	Got Rubin's face all over Antarctica, but nobody's seen him yet.
CARRIE	...You ever kill anyone?
PRYCE	...Unfortunately.
CARRIE	Anyone you ever trusted?
PRYCE	No.
CARRIE	I hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years. Wasn't supposed to need one down here. You asked what I was running away from...I came down here to forget my partner, Jack. Thought it would be better than any therapy.
PRYCE	What happened?
CARRIE	We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in Miami, waiting for this buy to go down. I was excited, we'd been after this trafficker for a long time. Thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass. Anyway, guy's a no show. One hour went by, then two - - nothing. Then Jack starting acting strange. Next thing I knew my face was being rammed into a mirror. My own partner was trying to kill me. Turns out the whole bust was a set up from the start. Jack was dirty, working with the guy we were after. Four years together. I knew things about him that his wife didn't even know. But he was my partner and I killed him that night. There's no changing that. Marshall service cleared me -- ruled it self-defense, but I had a real hard time getting over the betrayal -- how little my life meant to a guy I was willing to take a bullet for. Know what the kicker is -- Jack thought I was close to figuring him out. Thought this hotel room was the best place to get rid of me -- make it look like a bust gone bad. Truth is, I had no idea. God, I was young and stupid, and in way over my head.
CARRIE (cont'd)	You asked me why I smell like suntan lotion -- Jack wore Aramis, this cheap after-shave his wife gave him. Some of the guys down here wear it -- suntan lotion is the only thing that keeps me from smelling it. What do ya got there?
PRYCE	It's what the Russians used to transport weapons grade materials in. They match the dimensions inside the safe. We're looking for six of these. Langley's thinking it might be Hexafluoride, which is a derivative of Uranium. It's a component for nuclear detonation.
CARRIE	These beakers where really in over their heads.
RHONDA (V.O.)	Dinkle, it's Rhonda --
PRYCE	I better get this back to him. And we have to find Rubin.
CARRIE	Think you can you help me with these buttons, first?
PRYCE	Sure. For what it's worth -- I think you're pretty tough, Marshall.
MAN	...You Stetko? Don't...
CARRIE	Who are you?
RUBIN	-- Did Mooney talk to you? I didn't hear from him -- he was supposed to call me after you talked.
CARRIE	Mooney's dead.
RUBIN	No...
CARRIE	And so's Weiss. CONTINUED:
RUBIN	And I'm next, I know it.
CARRIE	It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down. Who's after you? Where are the cannisters?
RUBIN	Weiss didn't want to go through with it. Oh God. How did we let this happen?
CARRIE	Rubin -- I need you to focus for me. Carrie, it's Doc -- got those painkillers.
CARRIE	It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you.
CARRIE (cont'd)	You alright?
CARRIE (cont'd)	Pryce -- Yeah?
CARRIE	Rubin's here! He's on the run. Level one. White T-shirt. Jeans. He's heading for the Science Lab.
CARRIE	Rubin, wait!
CARRIE	Rubin -- I can help you! CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Door's jammed --
CARRIE (cont'd)	Pryce, it's not Rubin -- Someone's trying to kill him. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear on.
PRYCE	How long's he been out there?
CARRIE	Thirty seconds.
RUBIN	...Help me.
RUBIN	W..wa..wait.
RHONDA	Sam! CONTINUED:
KELLER	I sh... sh... shoulda killed you at Vostok.
CARRIE	Where are the cannisters?
KELLER	Go to hell.
PRYCE	Wrong answer.
CARRIE	Help me drag him over here.
CARRIE (cont'd)	Keep him still.
PRYCE	Who's Tahir selling it to -- what's the intended target?
KELLER	What're you doing, you crazy bitch?
CARRIE	Why did you kill those scientists, Keller? Was a four-way split too much for you?
KELLER	Fuck you.
CARRIE	Where is the uranium?
KELLER	You have no idea what's going on here, do you?
PRYCE	Hit the sonofabitch again!
KELLER	The plane, they're in the fucking plane.
MURPHY	Have you completely lost your mind?
CARRIE	Let go of me. Where in the plane?
KELLER	Find them yourself.
MURPHY	What the hell's going on?
CARRIE	The cannisters are on the plane.
CARRIE (cont'd)	Throw him in the holding cell.
MURPHY	Who the hell are you?
PRYCE	Name's Pryce.
CARRIE	He's with the UN. We have to search that plane now!
MURPHY	We don't have time. We'll just search it in Christchurch when it lands.
PRYCE	It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch. Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground. Once that plane is in the air, we've as good as lost it. Just give us 10 minutes.
CARRIE	Sam, do what is right here. Come on.
MURPHY	Do what you have to, but that plane takes off in one hour.
CARRIE	We'll need some help.
MURPHY	I'll send what I can.
PRYCE	It's clean. You check the cockpit?
CARRIE	Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, Keller?
PRYCE	I don't get it, why lie to us -- we have him either way. He's stuck here.
CARRIE	He's buying time.
CARRIE	Out of the way!
CARRIE	Shit!
PRYCE	He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.
CARRIE	He won't try. He's a goddamn pilot. CONTINUED:
INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE	Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open. CONTINUED:
PRYCE	...I didn't see him.
CARRIE	No! You stay awake!
CARRIE (cont'd)	Damn it! Come on. We're getting him up.
CARRIE	Press here. Hard. Hard or he will die!
DELFY	It won't stop!
CARRIE	He's not going to be number four! CONTINUED:
PRYCE	What are you doing? Get Keller.
CARRIE	You're bleeding out. Freezing drops your pulse. We have to slow it down. You hold on. Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet? No -- what's going --
CARRIE	Keller got out. He hurt Pryce -- he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc?
MURPHY (V.O.)	In the clinic. About to bring the bodies out. What's --
CARRIE	Tell him to stay put, and I need your help getting Pryce there. We're at the hangar. I've got to stop Keller, he's got the cannisters. Don't let him die. CONTINUED:
KELLER	Crazy bitch.
AT THE WRECKAGE	CONTINUED:
MURPHY	Doc!
DOC	Get him on the table! Don't move that hand.
DELFY	I know, I know, he'll die!
DOC	You, four units O-pos in the warmer. Second shelf, fridge. CONTINUED: What happened?
CARRIE	Keller hit him with an ice axe.
MURPHY	He get away?
CARRIE	No.
RHONDA	Sam, it's Rhonda -- we gotta go. Now. I know. I know. Murphy looks to Doc.
MURPHY	Can you do this on the plane? It's your call, but I need to know now.
CARRIE	I'll stay with you --
MURPHY	Grab the bodies and get them on the plane. CONTINUED:
DOC	Leave the bodies -- you don't have time. Dead is dead. Pick them up in six months. Go.
CARRIE	I'm sorry.
MURPHY	Leave'm. Let's go.
CARRIE	Thanks.
MURPHY	Take care of yourself.
PRYCE	Hey --
CARRIE	Hey back.
PRYCE	You get him?
CARRIE	Um-hm.
PRYCE	The cannisters?
CARRIE	Nope.
PRYCE	What did we miss? Think Keller cut and run without the stuff?
CARRIE	After all this, no way. Keller didn't have it on the plane because he's got it hidden somewhere. Where would he hide something for six months. Somewhere he could be sure no one would ever look.
PRYCE	If he had made it out, he wouldn't have been crazy enough to come back for it. CONTINUED:
CARRIE	True -- what the hell was his plan...
PRYCE	We've got six months to figure it out.
DOC	Eyes open -- that's always a good sign.
PRYCE	Hey, Doc -- thanks.
DOC	Thank her -- if she hadn't slowed your bleeding. I'm going to hunt me down a bottle of scotch --
CARRIE	Need any help?
DOC	I'm good.
DOC (cont'd)	You okay?
CARRIE	Just thinking where it all began.
DOC	Yeah, it's a damn shame, isn't it.
PRYCE	What is it?
CARRIE	Nothing -- I'll be right back. CONTINUED: Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three
CARRIE	Someplace no one would ever think to look.
DOC (O.C.)	If they had just gone along with it.
DOC (cont'd)	Those fools found a plane -- had no idea what they stumbled onto. Turns out the Russians had discovered a diamond field while drilling for core samples in the sixties.
CARRIE	And we thought it was nukes the whole time.
DOC	Keller said he knew someone in the states who could move the diamonds for us. It was a hell of a lot of money.
CARRIE	How did you get wrapped up in thing, Doc?
DOC	Weiss got hurt on the plane. They were afraid to move him, so Mooney called me. Keller and I flew out. But they couldn't get the safe open -- Keller found a way.
CARRIE	Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc.
DOC	Keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing. If those idiots hadn't panicked, none of this would have happened.
CARRIE	Doc -- stop.
DOC	I'll cut you in, Carrie. There's at least 5 million in diamonds in there. That can buy both of us a nice life back in the world. How many times have we both talked about having a fresh start. Well, this is it. Those beakers finding that plane was a sign. A sign telling me it was time to go back. Now I have something to go back for.
CARRIE	There is no granddaughter, is there? This was about greed, plain and simple.
DOC	No one will ever know. It's just me and you. We can take care of Pryce.
CARRIE	Dead is dead, right?
DOC	Yes, yes, now you're getting it.
CARRIE	What's happened to you? There are four people dead! Four! People we knew. Doc looks at her. She's not sure if it's registering. CONTINUED: Where you going to stuff my body too? Huh? Was I going to be five? I won't go through it again. Don't make me shoot you, please.
DOC	It's either ignore all of this or kill me -- and you and I, we're too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice.
CARRIE	Doc, your not thinking straight.
DOC	Ya know, it's really warm. I'm gonna take a walk -- try and cool off.
CARRIE	Doc, please.
DOC	Remember, Carrie -- freedom's just a sunrise away. CONTINUED:
PRYCE	How's the weather where you are?
CARRIE	Hot. But there's a gentle breeze. Fiji's beautiful this time of year.
PRYCE	Yeah, St. Barts ain't bad either.
PRYCE (cont'd)	Six months. Six long months.
CARRIE	Nah. Freedom's just a sunrise away.
