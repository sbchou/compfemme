CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
NINA	I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan.
NINA (CONT'D)	Different choreography, like the Bolshoi's. It was the prologue, when Rothbart casts his spell.
ERICA	You're in a good mood.
NINA	I'm just excited to get back.
ERICA	Off-season always makes you grumpy.
NINA	Look how pink. So pretty. 2A.
ERICA NINA	Pretty. Pretty.
NINA (CONT'D)	Plus he promised to feature me more.
ERICA	He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the company. What's that?
NINA	What?
ERICA	There.
ERICA (CONT'D)	Sweet girl.
VERONICA	Can't believe she's back.
GALINA	Of course she is.
VERONICA	She can't take a hint? Company's broke. No one comes to see her anymore.
SOLOIST 1	No one comes to see ballet period.
VERONICA	That's not true, I heard the Royal had one of their best seasons yet.
GALINA	He needs to try something new.
VERONICA	No, someone new.
SOLOIST 1	Like who?
VERONICA	Like someone who's not approaching menopause.
NINA	I think it's sad.
VERONICA	What's sad?
NINA	Beth's such an amazing dancer.
GALINA	So's my grand-mother.
NINA	Fonteyn danced into her 50's...
VERONICA	Yeah, we know.
NEW GIRL	Soloists?
NEW GIRL (CONT'D)	Great.
NEW GIRL (CONT'D)	Fucking got off the wrong stop and had to hoof it from 79th.
BALLET MISTRESS	To the back, fondu, to the back, plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and fifth, to the back... Like this. Push it. Why can't you do this? It needs to be looser. Relax. Let it flow.
LEROY	We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Her wish is granted in the form of a prince.
LEROY (CONT'D)	But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself. But, in death, finds freedom.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Good morning, company.
LEROY (CONT'D)	We open our season with Swan Lake. Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real. And a new production needs a new Swan Queen. A fresh face to present to the world.
LEROY (CONT'D)	But which of you can embody both swans? The white and the black?
LEROY (CONT'D)	All the soloists I touched... Please go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon.
LEROY (CONT'D)	And the girls I didn't touch, meet me in studio B at five.
BETH	What?!
LEROY	So Nina, would you like to be the Swan Queen?
NINA	If you want me to be.
LEROY	Well, if I was just casting the White Swan, she'd be yours.
LEROY (CONT'D)	But I'm not.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Maestro, Odile's Coda.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Show me your Black Swan, Nina.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Come on, not so controlled.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world! The fouettes are like a spider spinning her web. Come on! Attack it! Attack it!
LEROY (CONT'D)	Good of you to join us.
NEW GIRL	Sorry.
LEROY	Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Go on, get warmed up.
LILY	I'm good.
NINA	Should I go again?
LEROY	I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The White Swan's variation... 11A.
14 OMITTED 14	
ERICA	How did it go?
ERICA (CONT'D)	You were late, so I called Susie in the office. An audition?! Can't believe he just sprung that on you.
ERICA (CONT'D)	So?
NINA	It went okay.
ERICA	Just okay?
ERICA (CONT'D)	Darling?
ERICA (CONT'D)	Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened. I told them it doesn't matter how talented their daughter is, if she misses any more classes, she's out. She forgets half of what I teach her, and I waste time catching her up. It's ridiculous.
NINA	Ow!
ERICA (O.S.)	Everything alright?
NINA	I'm fine!
ERICA	Shhh. Almost done...You're working yourself too hard. We all have off days.
NINA	If that girl hadn't barged in.
ERICA	I'm sure she didn't mean to. Remember when you started? If I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you would have been completely lost.
NINA	I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I finished it.
ERICA	He knows you can do the coda. It won't convince him one way or the other.
ERICA (CONT'D)	Oh, sweetheart, I know it's disappointing. When you start to get older, there's all this ridiculous pressure. God knows, I understand.
ERICA (CONT'D)	But it's alright. No matter what. You'll probably get to dance the Pas de Quatre again. That's such a wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll shine.
NINA	I know, mom. 15A.
ERICA	Everything will be better in the morning. It always is.
LEROY	Yes, Nina?
NINA	Do you have a minute?
NINA	If now's not a good time...
LEROY	Now's fine, what is it?
NINA	I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it.
LEROY	How thrilling for you.
NINA	Well...
LEROY	Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now.
NINA	Yes, but-
LEROY	Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so...
NINA	I see.
LEROY	You're not going to try and change my mind? You must have thought it was possible, coming to find me like this. Why are you here? All dolled up?
NINA	I came to ask you to give me the part.
LEROY	That all?
LEROY (CONT'D)	Truth is, when I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. Yes, you're beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal casting. But the Black Swan...it's a hard fucking job to dance both.
NINA	I can be the Black Swan too.
LEROY	Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself.
LEROY (CONT'D)	All that discipline, for what?
NINA	I want to be perfect.
LEROY	Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Very few have it in them.
NINA	I- 18A.
LEROY	Ow! Fuck!
LEROY (CONT'D)	You bit me.
LEROY (CONT'D)	I can't believe it. That fucking hurt.
NINA	Sorry.
VERONICA	What?
NINA	Veronica?
NINA (CONT'D)	Congratulations.
VERONICA (O.S.)	Why did you tell me that?
VERONICA (CONT'D)	Your idea of a joke?
NINA	What?
VERONICA	Fuck you.
NINA	Hey...Everything's fine...He picked me, mommy.
NINA (CONT'D)	Did you hear me?...Yes, I'm going to be the Swan Queen.
NINA (CONT'D)	I'll be home soon, okay? I just had to tell you.
NINA	Mom?
ERICA	My daughter, the Swan Queen.
NINA	Oh, mom.
ERICA	It's our favorite, vanilla with strawberry filling.
NINA	Just a little piece.
NINA (CONT'D)	That's way too much.
ERICA	It's a celebration.
NINA	My stomach's still in knots.
ERICA	Fine then.
NINA	Mom, don't. I'm sorry.
ERICA	I'm just so proud of you.
NINA	It looks yummy. Hey there...
DAVID (CONT'D)	It is so full, where do I stand.
NINA	Yeah...good luck finding a spot.
DAVID	I am David.
NINA	I know you are. I'm Nina.
DAVID	Yes. Here we go, huh?
LEROY	Okay!
LEROY (CONT'D)	Okay, Nina. Very good.
LEROY (CONT'D)	But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem. The real work will be your metamorphosis into the Black Swan.
NINA	Okay.
LEROY	I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get ready to show me more of that bite.
LEROY (O.S.)	Watch the way she moves...
LEROY (CONT'D)	Imprecise, but sensual. She's not faking it. Pay attention.
SUSIE	You share with Beth from now on, so be considerate.
NINA	Thanks, Susie.
SUSIE	Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy.
NINA	Beautiful.
LEROY	Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
LEROY (CONT'D)	As I stand here tonight, I see so many familiar faces. Your contribution to the art we all cherish profoundly goes straight to my heart and I am very grateful.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Let me begin with a very important announcement. You all have had the chance to be enchanted, transported, sometimes devastated by the performances of this true artist of our company. She has been an exceptional inspiration to my work, a role model to our dancers and a deeply satisfying presence on our stage. You all know who I am talking about...Beth Macintyre
LEROY (CONT'D)	As we all know, every great career comes to an end. Beth is retiring at the end of the season. She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene, the role she originated in my first ballet.
LEROY (CONT'D)	She will be greatly missed, but she will always be remembered. My little princess.
LEROY (CONT'D)	But as we bid adieu to one star, we welcome another!
LEROY (CONT'D)	As you know, we open our season with my new version of Swan Lake. Taking the role of our new Swan Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina Sayers.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Soon you will have the pleasure of seeing her perform, tonight we raise a glass. To all of you, to Nina, to Beth, to beauty!
LEROY	Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors.
NINA	Such a beautiful event.
MRS. BRINSON	Not as beautiful as you, dear.
LEROY	And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Relax, you're doing great.
NINA	Just a second.
LILY (O.S.)	Come on! I'm about to burst!
She opens the door.	
LILY (CONT'D)	Hey! Look who it is.
LILY (CONT'D)	I'm Lily, by the way. Don't think we've officially met.
NINA	Nina.
LILY	Our New Swan Queen! That is so huge! You must be freaking out.
NINA	Yeah...
NINA (CONT'D)	I should probably get back.
LILY	Stay. Keep me company.
NINA	Excuse me. Ah, there you are.
NINA	I think I drank too much. All those toasts...
LEROY	You did well.
NINA	Really?
LEROY	They tried to eat you alive, but here you are, in one piece.
NINA	I guess.
LEROY	I'll get you a cab. Where you going?
NINA	Oh, Upper West Side.
LEROY	Why don't you come to my place first? It's on the way.
LEROY (CONT'D)	For a drink. Unless you've had enough.
NINA	No, that's good.
MRS. BRINSON (O.S.)	Thomas!!! You need to say hello to Karen Halloway before you disappear. She's from Texas. Correction: she is Texas.
LEROY	A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait here.
NINA	Hello?
NINA (CONT'D)	Beth? What are you doing out here?
NINA (CONT'D)	I was crushed to hear that you're leaving.
BETH	What'd you do to get the role?
BETH (CONT'D)	He always said you were a frigid little girl. So what did you do to make him change his mind? Suck his cock?
NINA	Some of us don't need to do that.
BETH	You fucking little whore.
NINA	Beth, I'm- What's going on?
BETH	I need to talk to you.
LEROY	You're drunk. You should go home.
BETH	Don't do that! Don't just dismiss me!
LEROY	Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together.
BETH	I'm going to drop by later, okay? I have something I want to give you.
LEROY	Come on.
BETH (O.S.)	A token of my appreciation.
BETH (CONT'D)	Make the most of it Nina.
LEROY (O.S.)	Here.
NINA	Thanks.
LEROY	I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little.
NINA	Yes.
LEROY	The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us.
NINA	Me neither.
LEROY	Good. So, do you have a boyfriend?
NINA	No...
LEROY	Have you had many in the past?
NINA	A few. But no one serious.
LEROY	You're not a virgin, are you? Then there's nothing to be embarrassed about, is there? And you enjoy making love?
NINA	Excuse me?
LEROY	Sex. Do you enjoy it?
LEROY (CONT'D)	We need to be able to talk about this.
NINA	Okay.
LEROY	So?
LEROY (CONT'D)	I have a homework assignment for you.
NINA	Yes?
LEROY	Go home and masturbate. Live a little. It's late. Lots of work tomorrow. The doorman will find you a cab.
ERICA	Sounds like quite an evening. Wish I could have been there.
NINA	You know I asked.
ERICA	I know, Susie told me. Guess he wanted you all to himself.
NINA	That's not why.
ERICA	I don't blame him.
ERICA (CONT'D)	Where did you get these?
NINA	They're fake.
ERICA	Fooled me.
NINA	I can do it.
ERICA	Turn.
ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)	He must have been at your side all night, showing you off. Oh Nina...
NINA	It's just a rash.
ERICA	What are you talking about?
NINA	It was worse a couple days ago. It's already getting better.
ERICA	You've been scratching again.
NINA	NO-
ERICA	I thought you'd outgrown this disgusting habit.(click) You haven't done it for years. (click)
NINA	Mom, please.
ERICA	It's the role, isn't it? All this pressure... I was worried it'd be too much.
ERICA	Don't be mad at me. You know I love you, you know I want what's best. But we have to take care of you.
NINA	What happened?
LEROY	She walked into the street, got hit by a car.
NINA	Oh my god...
LEROY	I'm sure she did it on purpose.
NINA	How do you know?
LEROY	Everything Beth ever did came from within. From some dark impulse. It's what could make her so thrilling to watch. Even perfect at times. But also destructive.
NINA	Was it right after we saw her?
LEROY	It's not your problem. This has nothing to do with you.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Nina, don't let yourself be distracted. Dance is not immortalized like music, poetry or art. It lives for now. For this moment only. And this is your moment.
OLDER NURSE	You can go in.
NINA	It's okay.
OLDER NURSE	What are you doing?!
LEROY	No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him.
LEROY	Forget about control. I want to see passion.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Let it out!
LEROY	David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her?
LEROY (CONT'D)	No, of course not. No one would be.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Nina, your Black Swan still looks no different than your White Swan. She's's just as...frigid. 43-46A.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Fuck!
LEROY (CONT'D)	Hey! We're still working in here. Lights back on.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Thank you! Okay, you guys can go. Thank you for your patience. You stay.
DAVID	Have fun.
LEROY	I'll be the Prince.
LEROY	Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!
LEROY (CONT'D)	Just feel my touch and respond. Slow down. Open your mouth. Open it. That was me seducing you. It needs to be the other way around.
NINA	Please don't...
VOICE (O.S.)	Hey...
NINA	Who's that?
LILY	You okay?
NINA	I'm fine.
LILY	You sure?
NINA	We can't smoke in here.
LILY	I won't tell if you won't.
LILY (CONT'D)	Big day's getting closer and closer, huh? I can't wait. You're going to be amazing.
NINA	Thanks...
LILY	So, want to talk about it?
NINA	Just had a hard day.
LILY	Leroy play too rough?
LILY (CONT'D)	He seems like a prick.
NINA	He's brilliant.
LILY	Sure, but not exactly warm and fuzzy.
NINA	You don't know him.
LILY	Someone's hot for teacher.
LILY (CONT'D)	It's okay. I don't blame you.
Nina stands up.	
NINA	I should go. It's getting late.
LILY	Hey, I was only playing.
LILY (CONT'D)	Nina?
ERICA (O.S.)	Nina?
NINA	I'll be out in a second.
LEROY	Try it again.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Again.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Again.
NINA	Do you have any corrections?
LEROY	No.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Lily talked to me. Said she saw you crying.
LEROY (CONT'D)	She said you were upset and I should "take it easy" on you.
NINA	I didn't tell her that.
LEROY	Maybe you'd like a break for a day or two.
NINA	THOMAS-
LEROY	Or a fucking month.
NINA	She shouldn't have said anything!
LEROY	I don't care! You shouldn't be whining to her!
NINA	I didn't.
LEROY	You could be brilliant. Taking it easy would be a betrayal.
NINA	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
LEROY	Stop saying that! Stop being so damn weak!
VERONICA	Look who's gracing us with her presence...
NINA	Lily, I need to talk to you.
LILY	Okay...
NINA	Now.
VERONICA	Ooooh.
LILY	Shut up.
LILY	What's wrong?
NINA	You told Thomas about last night?
LILY	I ran into him this morning. He said you guys were having some trouble.
NINA	Why would he talk to you?
LILY	Whoa your highness, I just told him you're working your ass off and I'm sure you'll be great.
NINA	You shouldn't have done that.
LILY	I didn't fucking do anything.
ERICA	Has he tried anything with you? He has a reputation...
ERICA (CONT'D)	I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights. "Rehearsing." I hope he's not taking advantage, that's all.
NINA	He's not.
ERICA	Good. I don't want you making the same mistake I did.
NINA	Thanks.
ERICA	Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned.
NINA	What career?
ERICA	The one I gave up to have you.
NINA	You were 28.
ERICA	So?
NINA	And only...
ERICA	Only what?
NINA	Nothing.
ERICA	What?
NINA	Nothing.
ERICA	How's your skin?
NINA	It's fine.
ERICA	We leaving it alone?
NINA	Yes.
ERICA	Let me see.
ERICA (CONT'D)	Take off your shirt.
NINA	No.
ERICA	Can I help you? (pause) I'm sorry, she's not in.
NINA	Who was it?
ERICA	It's no one.
NINA	Hello?
LILY	Hey.
NINA	What are you doing here?
LILY	I wanted to apologize. You were right, I shouldn't have talked to him about you.
ERICA	Sweetheart?
NINA	Give me a second.
ERICA	Your dinner...
NINA	Mom, please!
LILY	She's a trip...
NINA	How did you know where I live?
LILY	I have my ways.
LILY (CONT'D)	Relax, I got it from Susie in the office. I feel really shitty. Can I make it up to you? Take you out to dinner?
NINA	I don't think-
LILY	A drink?
ERICA	Sweetie, you need to rest.
LILY	Jesus.
NINA	Wait.
ERICA	What are you doing?
NINA	I'm going out.
ERICA	What?
NINA	Let's go.
LILY	Can't believe that's what he called her. So gross!
NINA	I think it's sweet.
LILY	Little princess? He probably calls every girl that.
NINA	Only Beth.
LILY	Well, I'm sure she lost the title after her game of chicken.
LILY (CONT'D)	Bet he'll be calling you little princes any day now.
NINA	I don't think so.
LILY	Sure, just gotta let him eat the pussy.
WAITER	Cheese burger, extra bloody.
LILY	Danke schoen.
WAITER	Let me know if it's not juicy enough.
LILY	Oh, I will.
WAITER	Enjoy.
LILY	What?
NINA	Guess I'm invisible.
LILY	Here, wanna spruce up?
LILY (CONT'D)	I always carry a spare, case I wake up somewhere unexpected. Not like you need more attention these days. How is he?
LILY (CONT'D)	Thomas?
NINA	I wouldn't know.
LILY	Yeah, right.
NINA	I don't want to talk about it.
LILY	Relax, you're so tense.
LILY (CONT'D)	One for you...
LILY (CONT'D)	And one for me. Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it with me straight from San Francisco.
NINA	What is it?
LILY	You're kidding? You never rolled?
LILY (CONT'D)	Oh boy. It'll just make you have a good time. Loosen up. See the night sky.
NINA	How long does it last?
LILY	Couple hours. Tops.
NINA	That's okay.
LILY	Sure?
LILY	Heeey, thought we could use some drinks.
NINA	I'm gonna go.
LILY	This is Tom and this is Jerry.
ANDREW	Actually it's Andrew.
TOM	Tom.
NINA	Hi.
LILY	You can't leave, I bought you a drink.
NINA	I really shouldn't, we're on the stage tomorrow.
LILY	What, you gonna go home to mommy? Live a little.
NINA	Just a couple of hours?
LILY	Tops.
LILY (CONT'D)	Go on.
LILY (CONT'D)	Let's go sit somewhere a little more comfortable. Gentlemen?
ANDREW	You haven't told me who you are.
NINA	Oh, I'm a dancer.
ANDREW	No, I mean your name.
NINA	Nina.
TOM	You two sisters? LILY NINA Yes. No.
ANDREW	Well?
LILY	We're blood sisters.
NINA	We dance in the same company.
TOM	Ahh, ballerinas. So that's why you look alike.
LILY	Tom and Jerry are gay lovers.
TOM	Very funny.
LILY	Oh, I just assumed.
ANDREW	I've never been to the ballet.
LILY	In that case you're definitely NOT gay.
TOM	It's pretty boring, isn't it?
NINA	No, it's not.
LILY	It's not for everyone. You probably aren't sophisticated enough.
TOM	You've got some mouth, you know that?
LILY	Isn't that compliment a little premature?
NINA	You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets.
TOM	Yeah...that'd be neat.
LILY	I think we all need another round. Bottom's up.
LILY (CONT'D)	Tom, come with me?
ANDREW	So...what are you guys working on these days?
NINA	Sorry. Swan Lake.
ANDREW	Yeah?
NINA	You know it?
ANDREW	Oh, no, not really. Heard of it though. What's it about?
NINA	It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell.
ANDREW	Okay.
NINA	Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.
ANDREW	So a happy ending, then?
NINA	It's beautiful, actually.
ANDREW	Like you.
NINA	Huh?
ANDREW	I said you're beautiful.
ANDREW (CONT'D)	That funny?
NINA	My hands are all sweaty.
LILY	Uh oh! Looks like someone's rolling. Let's get you dancing. Nina!
LILY (CONT'D)	Where you goin'?
ERICA	Do you have any idea what time it is?
NINA	Mmm-hmm. Late.
ERICA	Where have you been?
NINA	To the moon and back.
ERICA	You've been drinking.
NINA	Ding ding ding.
ERICA	What else?
NINA	Huh?
ERICA	What else have you been doing?
NINA	You want to know their names? You need to sleep it off.
NINA	There were two. Tom and Jerry...
ERICA	Be quiet, Nina.
NINA	I fucked both of them.
ERICA	Shut your mouth!
NINA	Don't come in here!
ERICA	What's this?
NINA	It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore!
ERICA	You're not my Nina right now!
NINA	LEAVE ME ALONE!!! Whoa...
DOUBLE	Sweet girl.
NINA	Why didn't you wake me up?
NINA (CONT'D)	I'm moving out.
NINA	My music.
LEROY	Keep going. Let's finish the Act.
LEROY (CONT'D)	That was good. Let's take 10, then we'll move on to Act 4.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Get warmed up.
NINA	Thomas, I'm sor-
LILY	Hey...
LILY (CONT'D)	He wanted to go through the spacing. Asked me to step in.
NINA	I overslept.
LILY	Oops... Least you had a good time, right? Hello?
NINA	You put something in my drink.
LILY	Yeah...
NINA	And took off this morning.
LILY	This morning?
NINA	Yeah, you slept over.
LILY	Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and you have a dick.
NINA	But we...
LILY	We what, Nina? What, you have some kind of lezzy wet dream?
NINA	You're lying.
LILY	Oh my god, you totally fantasized about me.
NINA	Stop.
LILY	Was I good?
NINA	Shut up!
LEROY	The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain.
LEROY (CONT'D)	You're not at all fearful. Filled with acceptance.
LEROY (CONT'D)	You look at the Prince, then down at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the audience...And jump!
LEROY (CONT'D)	Go ahead. You'll be fine.
LEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Everybody get a drink then it's notes. 74-76B.
77 OMITTED 77	
LEROY	At last, I saw the Black Swan.
COSTUMER	Sit still, I'm almost done.
COSTUMER (CONT'D)	Okay, all set. 77-78B.
LILY (O.S.)	Hey...Thomas sent me.
COSTUMER (O.S.)	Yeah, need to get you measured for your Swan Queen costumes.
NINA	What's she doing here?
LILY	He made me your alternate. Just in case...
NINA	Thomas!
NINA (CONT'D)	She's trying to replace me.

NINA	Lily. You made her my alternate.
LEROY	There's always an alternate, you know that. Lily's the best choice.
NINA	She wants my role.

LEROY	Nina...
NINA	Please believe me.
LEROY	Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning.
LEROY (CONT'D)	Tomorrow is yours. Give a great performance, and you won't have to worry about Lily, or anyone else.

LEROY	Nina?
LEROY (CONT'D)	Nina!
NINA	What?
LEROY	I already asked Lily-
NINA	Fuck. Have you announced it? After Beth, do you need more controversy?
NINA (CONT'D)	I'm here, Thomas. I'm doing it.
