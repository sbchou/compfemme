MIDDLE-AGED SON	23rd and Lex. The CABBIE grunts a reply.
MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)	How ya doin', Papa, you doin' alright?
ELDERLY MAN	Fine, fine...
MIDDLE-AGED SON	This is just a check-up, okay? Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us all. Traffic isn't bad. We should be back in time to watch the Mets. He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's
MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)	Papa? .Papa, what is it? IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive
ELDERLY MAN	...You. Can it be? The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back.
ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D)	Bielski. Can it possibly be? As we PUSH IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are
ASAEL	Where are they taking them?
ZUS	--Shveig! Shveig!
ZUS	Just shut up! Please...

WALENCKI	
WHAT DO YOU WANT?	Walencki brandishes a pitchfork.
ASAEL	Some food...?
WALENCKI	They are looking for you people. The two brothers glance nervously around.
WALENCKI (CONT'D)	Get away from here! GO! ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step
ASAEL	Zus. Let's go. As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer.
ZUS	We'll be back.
TUVIA	And no news of my brothers?
RIFKA	They are used to trouble, they'll be all right.
TUVIA	If you stay, you'll have to go to the ghetto.
RIFKA	I can get false papers and pass as a gentile. So can you. Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs
RIFKA (CONT'D)	Will you at least stay tonight?
TUVIA	I need to see to my family. Will you come?
RIFKA	To the country? No. A PAIR OF LEGS lie motionless behind a trough. Beyond, A
ASAEL	Papa-- Gottenyu... Flies buzz about dead LIVESTOCK. A WOMAN'S BODY lies nearby.

ASAEL	Aron. The boy (ARON) recoils. He is disoriented and WILL NOT Aron stares mutely straight ahead. Asael is shaking
ZUS	Stop it... But Asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic.
ZUS (CONT'D)	Stop it. STOP IT! Finally Zus grabs him in a gesture halfway between violence
TUVIA	If I was a German you are dead.
ASAEL	Tuvia! Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Papa and Mama. They killed them. Asael clings to him. Even Aron allows himself to be held.
ZUS	Big brother returns. Tuvia and Zus look at each other warily.
ZUS (CONT'D)	You saw them? Yes. Tuvia saw them. Zus takes the mezuzah from his pocket,
ZUS (CONT'D)	Welcome home.
ASAEL	Are you going back to the army?
TUVIA	There is no more army. Asael worships his big brother.
ZUS	Hope at least you killed a few. Tuvia just stares at him.
ASAEL	What is it like? To be in a war?
TUVIA	It wasn't war. It was something else. Zus eyes him carefully.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Where is Sonia and the baby?
ZUS	Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar. I'll bring her when it is safe. Where is Rifka?
TUVIA	In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave.
ZUS	You are still separated?
TUVIA	She is still my wife.
ZUS	Your rich wife. Zus chews with the open-mouthed relish of a peasant.
ZUS (CONT'D)	So why exactly have you come back? Tuvia just stares at him. The reason is obvious as he holds
ZUS (CONT'D)	You have a plan?
TUVIA	No. Do you?
TUVIA	Is there anything left to eat? Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among
ASAEL	Zus finished the last of the sausage. Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals.
ZUS	Stankowicz' farm is closest.
ASAEL	He has dogs.
ZUS	Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then.
TUVIA	You think Wilencki is going to give us food?
ZUS	No. We take it.
TUVIA	How?
ZUS	We...Take...It.
TUVIA	And he tells the police.
ZUS	I have run from the police my whole life. Do you really think it's a good time to stop? A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power?
ASAEL	We know these woods. They'll never find us in here. Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted. where Zus and Asael first tried to get food. Asael waits
16 INSIDE 16	The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus brandishes a hoe.
ZUS	We want food. Be quick about it!
WALENCKI	You again!
WALENCKI	Sure, sure. Take what you want... Tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack.
ZUS	Where is your gun, farmer?
WALENCKI	I have no gun. Zus grabs a dinner plate and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER'S Holding his bloody face, the farmer cowers in fear.
WALENCKI	Please... Zus kicks him. I beg you...
ZUS	He's lying. He kicks him again. The farmer begins to weep.
ZUS (CONT'D)	You're lying! Zus dumps the remains of the farmer's dinner onto him.
ZUS (CONT'D)	If I hit you once more, you will shit your pants. Twice and you will never shit again. The farmer knows Zus won't hesitate.
WALENCKI	Up there... Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle.
ZUS	We were never here. running through the woods. Zus raises the rifle in triumph.
TUVIA	He was willing to help us.
ZUS	He's lucky I didn't crush his head.
ZUS (CONT'D)	Fucking Polack. I've eaten shit from these people long enough!
TUVIA	This is your plan? To terrorize every anti-Semite in Belorussia?
ZUS	No. Some I will kill. Aron has been left alone. He holds a STICK which he "shoots" Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A where the three brothers gorge themselves on stolen food.
ZUS	Ah...
ASAEL	You know what Papa would do when you did that at table... Tuvia smacks Zus on the head, taking on a gruff voice.
TUVIA	Peasant. Tuvia imitates his father's criticism of Zus. Asael laughs.
ASAEL	I can't believe Papa's dead.
ZUS	Bernicki.
ASAEL	The police captain?
TUVIA	We don't know he did it.
ZUS	He always had it in for Papa.
TUVIA	We don't know he did it.
ZUS	So we will go and ask him if he did.
ASAEL	Koscik has a pistol. He showed it to me once. One pistol isn't enough. We need rifles. Machine guns.
TUVIA	Machine guns? You're going to take on the whole German army?
ZUS	Just because you didn't... The SOUND of footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle.
MIDDLE-AGED MAN	The child is hurt. The brothers stare at him. Wary and unwelcoming.
TUVIA	Set her down. The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving.
MIDDLE-AGED MAN	I am Avram Rubinski. This is my daughter. She-- The Germans-- He cannot bring himself to say the words. OTHERS shuffle
ASAEL	Where did you find them? Aron still won't speak. Asael addresses the other girl.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Your sister is sick?
LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL)	They kept her for a week. We fill in the rest. Zus has moved out of earshot. Tuvia joins him.
ZUS (CONT'D)	We cannot feed them.
TUVIA	I'll go ask Koscik for food.
ZUS	And the pistol.
TUVIA	And the pistol. Without another word, he starts off.
ZUS	Remember to say please.
KOSCIK	I have only four bullets.
TUVIA	I cannot thank you enough. They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE
KOSCIK	Your father was a good man.
TUVIA	He said the same of you. Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the
KOSCIK	Ignore the bitch. To the dead. God rest their souls. Bitch-- Do you want vodka? His wife just glares at him.
KOSCIK (CONT'D)	I live with this, can you imagine? HEADLIGHTS sweep over the window. A CAR is fast approaching.
KOSCIK (CONT'D)	Hide yourself. ...The barn. He climbs a ladder and is startled to find FIVE MORE MEN
23 OUTSIDE THE BARN 23	Koscik greets A BELARUSSIAN POLICE CAPTAIN and his SONS as
KOSCIK	Working late, boys.
POLICE CAPTAIN	Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are very organized. Koscik offers the bottle.
KOSCIK	Hunting can work up a thirst.
POLICE CAPTAIN	Fifteen in one day. The council is offering a year's free tax for every one you turn in. -
KOSCIK	A Jew is worth that much? Do you pay more for a fat one? They laugh appreciatively. A man COUGHS then shrugs an apology. Tuvia glares at him.
POLICE CAPTAIN	Caught five of them hiding in a ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid the Germans wouldn't want them.
KOSCIK	Maybe for a reduced price. More laughter. More vodka.
POLICE CAPTAIN	You know the Bielski's?
KOSCIK	Sure.
POLICE CAPTAIN	We missed two when we visited the parents.
26 IN THE LOFT 26	Tuvia listens to this casual talk of his parent's death.
POLICE CAPTAIN	Anybody caught helping them is in for it. You know this, Koscik?
KOSCIK	Do I look like an idiot? Don't answer so quickly... More laughter. The Police Captain looks at his watch.
POLICE CAPTAIN	Been at it since dawn. The wife doesn't like these long nights. He tries to hand back the bottle to Koscik.
KOSCIK	Keep it.
POLICE CAPTAIN	Bribing an officer of the law? Maybe you have more of this black market vodka hidden in the barn?
KOSCIK	Take a look. And clean out the cow shit while you're back there. The policeman laughs and climbs back into the car.
POLICE CAPTAIN	You'll keep your eyes open, yes?
KOSCIK	Good hunting. Koscik and Tuvia speak in harsh whispers.
KOSCIK	--If the laborers find them tomorrow, I will be denounced--
TUVIA	What am I supposed to do with--
KOSCIK	Take them into the forest--
TUVIA	--And feed them how? I can't care for my own family. Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their
TUVIA	Those men? They were the ones who killed my parents? Koscik doesn't want to tell him. Finally he nods, yes.
KOSCIK	You people. Why is it so fucking hard to be friends with a Jew? They embrace.
TUVIA	Imagine being one. Tuvia leads his motley band toward the woods. Tuvia leads them. He notices an OLD MAN staring at him.
OLD MAN	You sat in back. Tuvia just looks at him.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)	In school. I am Shimon H'aretz.
TUVIA	I thought you were dead.
SHIMON	I am at least half-dead. I heard them speaking of your parents. I am very sorry. Tuvia shakes his head.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	And the other brothers? What was his name, the wild one?
TUVIA	Zus. He's with the other two.
SHIMON	You are hiding here? In the forest? Tuvia nods.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	There has been trouble before maybe? With the police? Tuvia doesn't answer.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	So now you go to the forest. A wise choice.
TUVIA	For a dumb schoolboy, you mean.
SHIMON	My whole life I presumed to teach others the right way to live. I had no doubt: this is God's way, this isn't. You'll forgive me if recent events have somewhat shaken my resolve.
TUVIA	It is just like school, I don't know what you're talking about. Teacher...Come... Come. Please. The new arrivals squat by a fire where potatoes are cooking Shimon offers Aron something to eat.
SHIMON	Here... You're not hungry? Aron doesn't respond.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	The little one does not talk?
ASAEL	He saw. Things.
TUVIA, MEANWHILE	stares fixedly as Avram digs his daughter's grave. The gun
ZUS	I send you for food and you bring more mouths to feed.
TUVIA	You send me?
ZUS	Did you at least get the gun? Tuvia shows him.
TUVIA	Only four bullets.
ZUS	Then we'll have to make them count. Zus heads for the food. Asael is trying to start a fire
SHIMON	Here... Shimon takes a book from his coat, rips out pages covered
SHIMON (CONT'D)	The Psalms have many uses.
ZUS SITS AMONG THE NEWCOMERS	watching as they eat hungrily. Tuvia stops near Avram DIGGING a grave before heading out Tuvia stands in the driving rain, shaking. He stares at the
34 INSIDE THE HOUSE 34	The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw earlier eats dinner with his WIFE
WIFE	You worked late. The man nods, his mouth full of food.
WIFE (CONT'D)	Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off, yes?
POLICE CAPTAIN	...Fucking SS never sleeps... The door OPENS slowly. They all look up. Tuvia stands on the threshold, dripping wet, a spectral
TUVIA	You know who I am? The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Sit. The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is
TUVIA (CONT'D)	And you know why I am here.
POLICE CAPTAIN	...what are you talking about?
TUVIA	You have no idea what I'm talking about...
POLICE CAPTAIN	If they say find someone, I find him. It's my job. To find Jews.
POLICE CAPTAIN	Or lose my job.
TUVIA	And it's a good job, isn't it? You like your job.
POLICEMAN	I was always fair with your family. ...Everyone knew you were smuggling this and that. But I looked the other way. ...Ask your father.
TUVIA	My father? You don't talk about my father... Tuvia places the pistol against the man's forehead.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Down on your knees. The policeman begins to weep.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	For my parents, David and Beila Bielski... for my brothers and all the others--
POLICE CAPTAIN	Please.... I beg you... One of the man's SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia The police captain's wife is prostrate and KEENING over her
WIFE	Kill me, too! Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being
TUVIA	Tell them who did this.
TUVIA	Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam... Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered -- but they were monsters and did not deserve to live. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 20.
ZUS	Only one bullet left.
TUVIA	His sons. Zus nods his approval.
ZUS	How was it?
TUVIA	What?
ZUS	To kill them. It was good, no?
TUVIA	Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus
ZUS	What are we going to do with these others?
TUVIA	I don't know--
ZUS	The women will slow us down. And your old teacher--
TUVIA	You're afraid he's going to beat you for forgetting your homework.
ZUS	We have to be able to keep moving, and quickly.
TUVIA	I agree. But they're here. They consider their predicament.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	We'll sleep farther up the trail. If anyone comes, they'll find them first. The gunshots will give us time to escape.
ZUS	Alright. But no more.
TUVIA	No more. stumbling into camp behind Tuvia, who carries a heavy sack
TUVIA	I know. I know... Tamara, you remember Cousin Zus. Please, go sit down by the fire. And this is Lazar -- Isabel's youngest... Tamara is pleasant-looking but emotionally wounded.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	This is Isaac Malbin. From Minsk. Malbin is sweet-faced with little round Trotsky glasses.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Asael, find them something to eat.
ASAEL!	Zus takes Tuvia aside.
ZUS	Tuvia, I have pity for them all,
TUVIA	They are family.
ZUS	And how will we feed this family?
TUVIA	We'll water the soup. One of the new arrivals is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and
ZUS	And this one, is she family?
TUVIA	No. By the fire, the veterans pepper the newcomers with questions.
MIRIAM	You are from Lida! Is Isadore Korein alive?
LOVA	There are so many in the ghetto, I don't know...
TAMARA	Does anyone have news from Vilna?
TUVIA	Fuck me! Have you never used a hammer?
MALBIN	Uh. No.
TUVIA	What is it you do, then?
MALBIN	I suppose...you'd have to say...I was...am...an intellectual.
TUVIA	This is a job?
MALBIN	I published a small magazine... actually a journal...well, more like a pamphlet. Zus passes them, his arm around the dark-haired beauty.
ZUS	Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my forest wife.
TUVIA	I see. Congratulations. Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them.
MALBIN	Interesting concept.
TUVIA	As long as his village wife stays in hiding.
MALBIN	Nice to know there are some things even Hitler can't destroy. Suddenly the camp grows quiet. TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes
ZUS	Hello, boys, what can we do for you?
YOUNG MAN #1	Food. We want food. Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby.
ZUS	These little shits are holding us up. The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle.
ZUS (CONT'D)	You little shits have the balls to shoot me? In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND.
TUVIA	This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share.
ZUS	No.
ZUS (CONT'D)	I want to see if this little shit will shoot me. You like shooting Jews, you little shit?
YOUNG MAN #1	You are Jews?
ZUS	No. We're the Gestapo, you little shit.
TUVIA	Come. Sit. Put down your guns.
ZUS	Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove them up your ass.
TUVIA	Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia:
YOUNG MAN #1	Horodyszcze. The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there.
PERETZ	We haven't eaten in two days. My name is Peretz, this is Jacov.
JACOV	Two days ago there were three thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall.
ZUS	You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men look at one another.
JACOV	We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question.
ZUS	...There was a child. Jacov shakes his head. Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins
ASAEL	His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders
ZUS	So many dead.
TUVIA	I know.
ZUS	Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears.
ZUS (CONT'D)	Why not us?
TUVIA	I don't know.
ZUS	I thought they'd be safe. I should have been with them.
TUVIA	No.
ZUS	I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly.
ZUS (CONT'D)	Better to be rabbits? Hunted? Hiding? No... Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away. Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites--
PERETZ	We are looking for partisans.
JACOV	What is the name of your otriad? Tuvia laughs ruefully.
ASAEL	What is an 'otriad?'
TUVIA	An armed brigade.
JACOV	We heard the Russians are beginning to organize.
TUVIA	Here?
JACOV	And also in the Lipicanska.
ASAEL	Then we are the Bielski Otriad. You want to join?
PERETZ	The Russians are fighters.
JACOV	--But you need a gun to join them. Without a gun you are nothing. They sabotage railroads and kill Germans.
ZUS (O.S.)	We will kill all the Germans you can handle. Starting tonight. They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and filth.
ZUS (CONT'D)	If you're not afraid to use that rifle.
TUVIA	--we must get what we need without killing. We can't make more enemies-- Zus concentrates on opening the breach.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	--It won't bring your family back to life. Or Mama. Or Papa.
ZUS	Blood for blood. You had your revenge.
TUVIA	And I can still see their faces.
ZUS	'Vengeance is mine.' Who said that?
TUVIA	So this is God's work you're doing, Zussie?
ZUS	No. Only YOU can play God. Save a few lives, take a few others...
TUVIA	We cannot become...like them.
ZUS	If only... Are you coming with us or not?
TUVIA	Us?
ZUS	Peretz and Jacov. Asael, too. Tuvia looks over at Asael, who looks away.
TUVIA	You are making the decisions now? A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for
TUVIA (CONT'D)	We wait for dark. Lights up the night sky. A MAN comes running out of a
MAN	My truck! WHO DID THIS TO MY TRUCK? Tuvia, Zus and the others appear out the shadows.
TUVIA	We did. The man stops short at the sight of their weapons.
MAN	Who are you? You don't understand. They made me give them my truck... Zus FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes
TELL THEM!	Tuvia looks around warily. This is getting out of hand.
46 UP AHEAD 46	The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER. Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds
PERETZ	Look--! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching.
TUVIA	Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead

PRIVATE	It's one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply.
SERGEANT	Move it off the road before the convoy passes. I'll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch.
A STREAM OF PISS	Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away... catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in

JACOV	I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier.
FROM FAR AWAY	We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him
55 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 55	Tuvia stands, out of breath.
TUVIA	Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles.
ZUS	He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's
ZUS (CONT'D)	Peretz, Jacov, check the car for guns... This one's yours. He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy.
ZUS (CONT'D)	I'll check his pockets for more ammo.
TUVIA	Hurry--!
AT THE STAFF CAR	Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several
JACOV	They were on their way to a party! They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia.
56 UP THE ROAD 56	Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older
57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57	ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He

PERETZ	Now we are real Partisans...
JACOV	To the Bielski Otriad!
TUVIA	Into the fields! RUN! Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Jacov, NO! THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE. Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not

TUVIA	Asael... He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think Plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out. A somber mood. Tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the
SHIMON	They thought you were bringing food. Tuvia just stares at him. Did the farmers stop you? Still no answer from Tuvia.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	They had guns? Dogs?
TUVIA	No.
SHIMON	I don't understand. Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	The Talmud says if you save a life you must take responsibility for it.
TUVIA	Again I have no idea what you are talking about. Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces.
SHIMON	I think you do.
VOICE	You are the Bielski's? A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall,
ZUS	How'd you get past the Lazar?
BEN ZION	Who? Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning
ZUS	You shit! You worthless shit! Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy,
TUVIA	Enough!
ZUS	He walked right by you! Someone could have been killed! Tuvia pulls Zus off him.
TUVIA	I said, enough! Get up! Get up!
ZUS	If we were real partisans he'd be shot.
TUVIA	He made a mistake!
ZUS	MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes! As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF.
TUVIA	That's right, Zus. No mistakes. Like last night. First they will torture Asael...and then they will hang him. Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground.
63 BACK IN CAMP 63	Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion looks up at him.
BEN ZION	You are Tuvia Bielski.
TUVIA	You know me?
BEN ZION	I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz. Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family.
MIRIAM	Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My sister lives on Passaya Street.
BEN ZION	The SD came without warning. Hundreds were taken. No one knows where. THE WOMAN begins to cry.
MIRIAM	My poor sister...dear God, no... Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles:
WOMAN #1	We'd be better off in the ghetto...
TAMARA	At least here we are safe.
LOVA	There at least we had hope...
SHIMON	No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others
WOMAN #1	We are hungry! This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he
TUVIA	I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission.
RONA	Look what happened the last time.
TUVIA	That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	We could be here a long time. And we have to prepare.
LOVA	How?
TUVIA	Better security. Better at getting food and information-- --at making shelters. Whatever is needed. We all participate. We don't work against each other. At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	I want to kill Nazis, too, but we...just...cannot afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up.
ARON	Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken.
TUVIA	Or Asael. We... We-- --cannot lose anyone. He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them
TUVIA (CONT'D)	...We will map out where we've been so as to not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can afford to give, and leave those who can't alone.
LOVA	The poorest farmer has more than us.
TUVIA	True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves. Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals. We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. The trees take on color as if in celebration of their coming All is quiet as Tuvia, Zus and Ben Zion watch from the woods.
TUVIA	Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the
66 OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 66	Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them.
TUVIA	Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian:
KOSCIK'S WIFE	In the barn. Zus calls out.
ZUS	Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find:
KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK	is just beyond the barn. Tuvia finishes piling on the last
TUVIA	I'm sorry.
KOSCIK'S WIFE	Come.
69 A ROOT CELLAR 69	dug into a hillside. Overgrown with tall grass it is
TUVIA	Thank God. Zus pulls his lost brother into a mighty embrace.
ASAEL	Zus.... ZUSSIE... I can't breathe. Zus lets him go and Asael reaches back into the root cellar.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Look. Two LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN -- BELLA and CHAYA -- emerge, appreciatively.
ZUS	Asael... Well, well.. Shut up. Look at this-- He has two more rifles and a large box of ammunition.
TUVIA	Thank you.
KOSCIK'S WIFE	Go.
70 A FOREST TRAIL 70	They head for home. Zus walks beside Bella.
BELLA	--and then we fell into this horrible bog. Chaya saved me. Honestly, I can't swim at all. Then I will teach you!
BELLA	We must have got lost a dozen times. I was absolutely resigned to die.
ZUS	No...
BELLA	Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the absolute worst? And that farmer, Mr. Koscik, kept making the most vulgar jokes, he said any girl who-- As they continue out of earshot, it appears as though Zus Aron and Rachel are walking through the woods. For a brief Their bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a
MALBIN	You're trying to tell me all politics is meaningless.
SHIMON	In the West a monster with a little mustache, in the East a monster with a big mustache. This is all I need to know about politics.
MALBIN	Your messiah will have a mustache, too, and a full beard.
SHIMON	No. The messiahs are all in politics, and they're killing us. Zus unloads two cut and stripped trees.
ZUS	What's killing me is all your talking. Back to work. Malbin and Shimon go back to work.
MALBIN	And Roosevelt? He has no mustache.
SHIMON	My life in these woods is much easier because of Mr. Roosevelt, thank you. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 41.
TUVIA	We need to know what's going on in the villages, how the Germans patrol, who the informers are-- He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Are you listening to me?
ASAEL	Yes.
TUVIA	What's her name?
ASAEL	Chaya. [I believe.]
CHAYA!	He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael
TUVIA (CONT'D)	So talk to her.
ASAEL	I hardly know her.
TUVIA	You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation.
ASAEL	Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We need two guns at least...
TUVIA	Whose turn to go?
ASAEL	Zus.
TUVIA	You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods. Go on...Go! Asael heads toward Chaya.
BEN ZION	This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You fix the patch to the rod-- They do as he instructs.
BEN ZION (CONT'D)	--then run it through the barrel... and don't lose the patch in the Lazar looks up, sheepishly.
LAZAR	I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother,
ARKADY LUBCZANSKI	The village idiot. Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who
LAZAR	Thank you, Zus.
ZUS	It's nothing. KISSELY is a MILKMAN with bright red hair and a bushy
ZUS	Good morning, friend. Getting an early start to market? Could you possibly spare us a bit of milk? Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand.
KISSELY	This is what I'm required to give the Germans. If I don't meet my quota they'll shoot me and my family. Zus is tempted to shoot him himself.
ASAEL	Leave half. He can't go to the Germans empty-handed. Zus glares at Asael.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Tuvia's orders. Zus shakes his head, climbs onto the wagon and begins
ZUS	We are so grateful, comrade, for your cooperation. What a lovely coat. Is that a fur collar? Zus shakes his head. Lazar stands, pointing his weapon.
ZUS	Lazar, you can see it's us, you idiot. You only ask, 'who goes there' when you don't know who it is.
LAZAR	Sorry, Zus.
78 THE CAMP 78	is a beehive of activity. Shimon and Malbin are digging.
MALBIN	Even Spinoza said existence can be substantiated by empirical evidence.
SHIMON	All your secular learning, yet you know nothing of life.
MALBIN	How can you say this? Learning is my life.
SHIMON	And for every fact that goes in your head, another comes out your rear end. CHAYA and BELLA receive the bounty from the foragers.
BELLA	Milk, eggs -- Chaya, our brave men have brought us a feast!
ZUS	Blintzes! You will make me blintzes! She bestows her best smile upon him.
79 BY THE FIRE 79	New arrivals are being shown around by Ben Zion. A MAN and WOMAN cry out with joy at an unexpected reunion. ARKADY LUBCZANSKi approaches Chaya.
ARKADY	I don't think we've been properly introduced. Arkady Lubczanski.
CHAYA	Hello.
ARKADY	You are Chaya?
CHAYA	...Yes.
ARKADY	You are getting along all right? Anything you need? An extra blanket?
CHAYA	Oh. Well... Yes, that would be nice.
ARKADY	You'll have it by tonight. Something nice and soft. I couldn't help but notice you don't have a husband yet.
CHAYA	Yet?
ARKADY	Most of the woman have already chosen. They haven't told you about this?
CHAYA	No. But thank you for explaining it. She hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon.
MALBIN	Descartes at least provided for the subjective nature of experience. He takes a spoon from his sock.
SHIMON	Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist.
MALBIN	You are not eating?
SHIMON	By my best calculation, today is High Holiday. I am fasting. Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in.
TUVIA	What is it?
BEN ZION	The new ones, they are from Novagroduk. Your wife-- Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates...
BEN ZION (CONT'D)	They say...She was killed last week. I'm sorry. Tuvia nods. No outward display of grief. An awkward moment.
TUVIA	Thank you for telling me. We have to dig a trench around the new zemylanka. If it rains I'm afraid water will seep in. Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news.
BEN ZION	I'll see to it, then. Tuvia nods and walks away.
ARON	Jacob's ladders. Like in his dream. Asael says you can see the angels. They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD TRACKS. A
RACHEL	Can we stay to watch?
ARON	If we hide. They move back into the trees as the train NEARS: a slow-
RACHEL	Is that a Nazi train?
ARON	If we had some dynamite we could blow the shit out of it.
RACHEL	...Just like your brothers. Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion. They stare in astonishment.
SHIMON	I am sorry for your loss. Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	Do you want to say the Kaddish? When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself.
TUVIA	She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a day went by she didn't remind me I wasn't a good provider. For years it wasn't really a marriage at all. And now... He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him.
BELLA	You have lipstick? Please, I know you have some left. Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella May I join you?
ZUS	Of course.
BELLA	You get lonely out here?
ZUS	I like the woods. LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees.
BELLA	I'm a little scared out here. Zus knows an opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a I've never tried it.
ZUS	Go ahead. She drinks, refuses to grimace. Drinks again. Zus laughs. -
BELLA	Why is there a rule against women having guns?
ZUS	There aren't enough for the men.
BELLA	Women need guns, too.
ZUS	What for?
BELLA	For protection.
ZUS	Women have men for protection. Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic.
BELLA	I want protection. She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto
BELLA (CONT'D)	You will take good care of me? You will be my commander. ARMED POLICEMEN are advancing through the trees. ARON RUNS through the woods like a deer. She follows.
85 IN THE CAMP 85	He bursts in, SCREAMING.
MEN WITH GUNS!	Chaos. People panic, search for family members, grab whatever they ZUS AND BELLA emerge from the woods where they have lain
ASAEL	Don't panic. THIS WAY!. GO. THE POLICEMEN begin FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED.
TUVIA	Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us. Asael, keep them moving. Don't stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a
KISSELY	This way--
86 THE FOREST IS DEATHLY STILL 86	Tuvia and Zus usher the group across the river and up the
TUVIA	Go! Go! Move! Isaac, keep them moving! Zus, Asael, Ben Zion... Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while The policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes down. The German Soldier An edgy silence. From the trees a VOICE calls out in Russian--
THE FOOL?	The policemen exchange apprehensive looks. The confrontation changes languages. Derisive laughter from the trees.
POLICEMAN	Give us Bielski and the rest of you can go free! Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his
TUVIA	You are from Belarussia, pig! Why do you work for the Germans against your own people?
KISSELY	For the same reason you steal from the poor. To survive. ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Kessely is hit in the arm.
KISSELY (CONT'D)	Shit.
ZUS	Next one is to the head!
TUVIA	Soon it will be dark... See how you find your way home then! The policemen are having similar thoughts.
AFTER A MOMENT	Tuvia, Zus, Lova & Ben Zion emerge. Zus picks up the dead
TUVIA (CONT'D)	They'll be back. We have to find a new camp.
ZUS	Next time just draw them a map.
TUVIA	What does that mean?
ZUS	It means -- we should have killed the fucking milkman. Your policy of diplomacy is shit. Zus is breathing hard, full of the adrenaline of battle.
ZUS (CONT'D)	...Two are dead. Winter is coming and now we have no shelter. Why? Because you don't have the stomach to do what must be done. He walks away.
MALBIN	Where is he taking us? My feet are going to fall off.
SHIMON	A great rabbi once said, "wherever I go, I am always going to the land of Israel."
MALBIN	Well, maybe rabbis should give better directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart.
89 A HILLSIDE 89	The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a
TUVIA	Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES
GRAMOV	
WHO ARE YOU?	Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes.
TUVIA	A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades. Zus almost does a double-take at Tuvia's bluff.
GRAMOV	What brigade?
TUVIA	We belong to the Bielski otriad.
GRAMOV	We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun.
ZUS	I'll take the two on the left... Tuvia maintains his composure.
TUVIA	I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander. A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet
VIKTOR	I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us. How do you respond to these charges?
TUVIA	When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing.
VIKTOR	We are soldiers.
TUVIA	And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma.
VIKTOR	But Jews do not fight.
TUVIA	These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment.
VIKTOR	We will see. Select your best fighters and send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice.
TUVIA	We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came.
ZUS	So we're partisans now.
TUVIA	As if we have a choice.
91A NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 91A	Has taken root. People hard at work building zemylanka.
92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92	Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker.
TUVIA	Here.
MALBIN	If my friends at The New Socialists' Club could see me now... I haven't read a book in months.
TUVIA	I haven't read one in years. Malbin looks up from his work.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	I wasn't a very good student. You can ask Shimon.
MALBIN	.I did. Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him for a moment.
TUVIA	Yet you accept me as Commander. Malbin thinks about it for a moment.
MALBIN	Who else? Tuvia nods. Good point. They continue working.
MALBIN (CONT'D)	Might I make an observation? Tuvia gestures, go ahead. We need to be strong, but--
TUVIA	...But--?
MALBIN	Other things are important, too.
TUVIA	Such as? Malbin tries to think how best to put it.
MALBIN	Community. Tuvia considers the word. As if trying it on for size.
TUVIA	You have more ideas? About all this?
MALBIN	...A few.
TUVIA	I'm listening...
BELLA	More mouths to feed.
RONA	More young bodies to keep us warm. One ot them, a young man, YITZHAK SHULMAN, RIPS the yellow
SHULMAN	Which one is Tuvia Bielski? Someone points Tuvia out. Shulman hurries over and kisses None of us knew if you really existed. I am from Baranowicze. They are going to liquidate the ghetto. Chaya bursts into tears. Asael puts his arm around her.
CHAYA	My parents-- Zus catches Tuvia's glance to Malbin. Tuvia turns back to
TUVIA	We'll do what we can. Shulman tries to kiss Tuvia's hand once again, but Tuvia
CHAYA	You will help my parents?
CHAYA	I've seen you looking at me. If you were to rescue them, I would do... anything...you-- Asael is completely undone by the starkness of this.
ASAEL	No. I mean, yes. All right. and grabs him as he walks away. Their hushed tones belie
ZUS	And what exactly does that mean, 'do what we can.'
TUVIA	We must send for whoever is left alive.
ZUS	And if it is a hundred? Six hundred?
TUVIA	Then we will provide.
ZUS	And when the Germans follow these hundreds and slaughter us.
TUVIA	I won't let that happen. Tuvia exchanges a glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He
ZUS	You won't let that happen.
TUVIA	No. I'll bring them out myself.
ZUS	From the ghetto.
TUVIA	Yes.
ZUS	Pan Tuvia. Rabbi Tuvia. Allow me to kiss your hand... Tuvia tries to pull his hand away, but Zus holds him.
ZUS (CONT'D)	You think Pachenko wants hundreds more of us in the forest?
TUVIA	I cannot have you contradicting me... Not when others are around. Our family must stick together.
ZUS	And who is it that's risking our family, and for what? For the sake of these-- --Malbushim.
TUVIA	Don't call them that.
ZUS	That's who comes to us from the ghetto. Empty clothes. Bloodsuckers.
TUVIA	They are people. Jews.
ZUS	Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses and wouldn't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street. Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands. You think your old teacher will give you a good grade because you saved his worthless ass! They accept you as their leader only because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves.
TUVIA	--What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella, who is anxiously watching. --You think she'd be with you if it wasn't for what is happening here? Zus glares at him, but tries to control himself.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	--Is it love Zus? Zus is sick of talk. He PUNCHES Tuvia in the face. Tuvia
TUVIA (CONT'D)	You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of Novagrudok? Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him.
ZUS	Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily --
ZUS (CONT'D)	Ben Zion. Krensky. Lova. Israel. Let's go. We are going to join the real partisans. He looks at Asael.
ZUS (CONT'D)	Are you coming? Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he
ASAEL	No.
ZUS	Good. I'll dance at your wedding. He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears Tuvia and Asael feel naked outside the safety of the forest. Tuvia and Asael pass by the barbed wire and machine-guns of
TUVIA	This way.
ELDER #1	We are not so naive as to believe they won't kill some of us. But all the Jews? It makes no sense. They need us to work. In the factories. The labor camps. Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL standing on a chair in order to
TUVIA	There are rumors. Of death camps. We too have heard of such places. But have you seen them yourself? Can you tell me, with absolute certainty, that we are not just as likely to die out there with you in the woods with Winter coming on...? Someone WHISTLES from the street below. A tense moment. --Do you think we haven't all considered running away? For every one that leaves they kill twenty. How can I sacrifice thousands for the sake of a few?" Tuvia looks at them, rubbing his face in concentration.
TUVIA	What if we were to take all of you?
ELDER #1	The old, the sick? There are thousands. How will we live?
TUVIA	We will protect you. We have made alliances with the Russian Partisans.
ELDER #1	They are as bad as the Nazi's. You are too young to know the pogroms-- Tuvia SLAMS HIS FIST on a table.
TUVIA	YOU WANT TIME? Fine, I give you a day. A month. Maybe a year. To live! Your daughter is out there with us. Your husband is waiting for you. An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Rabbi?
RABBI	We...are waiting for God. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief. Such madness is
LILKA	I am going. This breaks the log jam. Several others join in, "We are Out in the alley, Asael stops them momentarily as a car

MALBIN	And now they belong to the otriad. Everyone sacrifices for the sake of the collective. We can trade these for food or weapons. Next... Nearby, Shimon is INTERVIEWING another line of arrivals.
SHIMON	--How about carpenters? Any bootmakers? Seamstresses?
ARRIVAL #1	I am an accountant. That should come in handy. Next...
RIVA	I am a nurse.
SHIMON	Ahhh...welcome. And you, tateh? OPPENHEIM is an old man with thick glasses.
OPPENHEIM	I am a watchmaker. Tuvia has walked over to observe.
TUVIA	Can you repair guns?
OPPENHEIM	Guns? No.
TUVIA	See if you can fix this trigger. Oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the
TUVIA (CONT'D)	You have a new profession. A murmur of appreciation ripples through the group as Shulman
SHULMAN	Look what we found running free. Must have belonged to an aristocrat.
TUVIA	My God, she's beautiful. May I? He mounts her easily, urges her around the perimeter, Friends, we are happy to see you safely among us. But there are many things you must learn about living here... All attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Once you are settled, you'll be assigned work duties. Everyone works, no exceptions.

101B BACK TO TUVIA ON HORSEBACK 101B	Malbin catches his eye and winks -- clearly this has been
TUVIA	Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You will all learn to protect yourselves. A LITTLE BOY holds Lilka's hand and looks up at Tuvia in
LITTLE BOY	He is a Jew? Lilka is equally struck -- although there is something more
TUVU	Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot accommodate an infant's needs. Our bunkers are overcrowded so you will have to build new ones. He looks out over the sea of expectant faces. ...This is the one place in all of Belorussia where a Jew can be free. We will make again, here in this forest, the life that was taken from you. We welcome you into our community.
RIVA	You are Tuvia Bielski? You are really him? You are a hero. A Maccabee. She vigorously shakes Tuvia's hand and walks away. Tuvia Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the
LILKA	Get them off! Get them off me!
CHAYA	What? Where?
RIVA	Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria.

102C LATER THAT DAY 102C	THE WOMEN wash clothes in the stream. Lilka is by the
TAMARA	You get rid of them quicker if you boil them. Lilka is grateful for this bit of camp wisdom.
BELLA	Tamara, come on in, it's freezing and slimy and horrible. Tamara shakes her head, no.
RIVA	So modest...
BELLA	... So last night I dreamed I was taking a real bath. With hot water.
RACHEL	And soap.
RIVA	And bubbles.
CHAYA	Oh, take me to that dream!
RIVA	I was dreaming of shoes...
CHAYA	Shoes, Riva?
RIVA	There was a man in a shop on Grudek street... and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes... Riva swoons. The women burst into ribald laughter. The
BELLA	Doesn't take a fortune teller to know what Lilka's dreaming about... Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even louder.
GRAMOV	--buried underneath with this
DETONATOR--	--almost touching the rail. As the train passes, its weight causes pressure on the detonator, and then--
BOOM!	Zus falls over, startled. Gramov laughs. Partisan humor. Chaya is on kitchen detail with Tamara.
TAMARA	Yesterday, potatoes with beets, Today, beets with potatoes. Special treat tomorrow...potato soup. With beets. Not far away, Arkady and several others have created a
ARKADY	We love potatoes, don't we, boys! Here, put some hair on your chest! They give Aron his first taste.

104A NEARBY 104A	Asael "happens" to bump into Chaya.
ASAEL	Hello, Chaya.
CHAYA	Hello, Asael.
ASAEL	May...I help you?
CHAYA	Wash clothes? I... don't think so. An awkward moment as he stands there watching her.
ASAEL	Chaya... I...was...wondering...if... maybe...you...I mean... you and I--
CHAYA	I accept.
ASAEL	You do?
CHAYA	I do.
104B ANOTHER DAY 104B	Asael and Chaya are getting married. A LIGHT SNOW is falling
ASAEL	Behold thou art consecrated unto me by this ring according to the Laws of Moses and Israel. But rather than a ring, Asael gives her a shiny new rifle.
104D BACK TO THE WEDDING 104D	As Asael kisses the bride, Tuvia is staring not at the As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot: The driver SLUMPS over the wheel and the truck careens lazily GERMAN SOLDIERS spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus's People dance and sing, their joy juxtaposed with the Some of the inexperienced Jewish fighters freeze, some fire
ZUS	Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I'LL SHOOT He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners, VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes.
VIKTOR	You are related to Bielski?
ZUS	I am a Bielski, too. Viktor looks at him appraisingly.
VIKTOR	Indeed. He walks away. Zus has found a home. In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket. Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron
109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A	Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes.
ASAEL	There is talk of returning to the ghetto.
TUVIA	Madness.
ASAEL	They've barely eaten in days. Even get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers for a moment.
TUVIA	Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery
109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA	Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him. A whisper runs through the group..."meat"..."what kind?"..." Tuvia watches them eat hungrily. Snow falling outside. Several partisans are singing. Zus
VIKTOR	Another dead soldier! Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains:
VIKTOR (CONT'D)	More dead soldiers than empty bottles.
ZUS	That is so...Russian. He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug.
VIKTOR	At least you drink like one.
ZUS	'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.' What is it we are good at, Viktor? Dying. That is what we are good at.
VIKTOR	So tell me about this brother of yours...
ZUS	.Asael?
VIKTOR	You are such an idiot.
ZUS	I know who you mean... The Great Tuvia Bielski. Savior of the Jews and all around Big Shit.
VIKTOR	You compete with him.
ZUS	He competes with me.
VIKTOR	My older brother and I have the same relationship.
ZUS	He is a Big Shit also?
VIKTOR	A soldier. He was killed in the first hour of the German invasion. This sobers them up a bit. LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused.
TUVIA	Lilka?
LILKA	Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking. It's nothing. He looks at her intently, knowing there's more.
LILKA (CONT'D)	...Every time new people come into camp, I keep hoping... even though, I know... ...I'm sorry.
TUVIA	Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed.
LILKA	You too?
TUVIA	Here... He takes off his wool coat and puts it around her shoulders.
LILKA	No. Today I go on my first food mission. Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty.
TUVIA	I will have Asael send someone else.
LILKA	No. I must go now. I want to go. She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He
TUVIA	You know how to use this? She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who
MOTL LUBCZANSKI	She is a tasty one, your aristocrat.
TUVIA	She is not my aristocrat.
ARKADY LUBCZANSKI	No? We were told, 'hands off,' property of the Commander. Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue.
111 LATER THAT DAY 111	Tuvia walks past the now-empty stable heading into the woods.
TUVIA	Lazar. I am coming from camp. The danger is from those coming to camp. Sorry, Tuvia...
TUVIA	No sign of the food mission?
LAZAR	Not yet. Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods.
SHULMAN	We mustn't have any tracks leading back to base. He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders.
SHULMAN (CONT'D)	Stay on this side of the creek until you reach the river then up the hill. I'll wait here for the others. She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow.
RIVA	--several cases of pneumonia... Also I'm beginning to see signs of scurvy. No one's had a vegetable in weeks.
LAZAR	Tuvia! Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp.
RIVA	Bring him to the infirmary. Tuvia glances back toward the woods. Looks at his watch.
RIVA (CONT'D)	...Shulman will look after her. He looks up. She looks at him sympathetically. Apparently

TUVIA	What's wrong with them all?
RIVA	If it's typhus we're in trouble. The lice are carriers.
ASAEL	The partisans have ampicillin. But they say they need it for themselves. In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Tuvia...
TUVIA	Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I'll go see Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Are you all right?
LILKA	Fine. Thank you. Tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken -- but he has no
TUVIA	I must go. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 75. Viktor, Gramov and Zus are poring over a map of the area.
VIKTOR	--and every time we try to move, they radio back to police HQ which houses the transmitter...here.
ZUS	--So we attack the transmitter.
VIKTOR	Yes, yes, my Hebrew warrior. Except for the troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front. THE TENT FLAP OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough.
VIKTOR (CONT'D)	Two Bielski's in one room! To what do we owe this honor?
TUVIA	We have sickness. I need ampicillin.
VIKTOR	This medicine is reserved for fighters.
TUVIA	If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may spread to yours.
VIKTOR	I will have to take that chance. Zus looks from one immovable force to the other.
TUVIA	I must insist. Comrade.
VIKTOR	You'd better not. Zus is watching this dick-measuring with keen interest.
ZUS	There would be medicine in the police headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes? He looks to Gramov, who looks to Viktor, who nods.
ZUS (CONT'D)	Tuvia and I grew up there. Perhaps the Bielski otriad will volunteer to take out the transmitter. Viktor looks from Zus to Tuvia.
TUVIA	Of course. Zus grabs his submachine gun.
ZUS	Krensky, Ben Zion. Let's go. is quiet at midnight on this snowy evening.
116 IN A BACK ALLEY 116	Tuvia and Zus sit in the cab of an old truck, its exhaust
ZUS	Well... He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously
ZUS (CONT'D)	Stay with the truck. And make sure it's in gear when we get back.
TUVIA	I'm going in with you.
ZUS	I give the orders tonight. Across the square, the police station looms.
TUVIA	You don't have to do this.
ZUS	I don't? What about the typhus?
TUVIA	So more die. They will anyway. A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside.
ZUS	I have been given this mission by my superior officer. He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket,
TUVIA	Zus... For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the But rather than follow them into the police station, we
BEN ZION	Let's GO! In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES.
118 TUVIA WATCHES 118	as Zus bursts out the door. He races to the truck and
ZUS	Go. GO!
TUVIA	What about the others?!
ZUS	Medicine.
TUVIA	The others?
ZUS	Fighters die so that malbushim may live, that's what you believe, yes? Tuvia absorbs the accusation as if taking a punch.
TUVIA	So you're a communist now, Zus? Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes.
ZUS	Communist, Zionist, Manicurist, what difference does it make? You got your medicine.
TUVIA	Come back to us. Zus won't look at him.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	You are my brother.
ZUS	So you remember.
SHIMON	Merciful God, we commit our friends Ben Zion and Krensky to your care. We have no more prayers, no more tears. We have run out of blood. Choose another people We PAN PAST the familiar faces.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	We have paid for each of your Commandments. We have covered every field and stone with ashes. Sanctify another land. Choose another people. Teach them the Deeds and the Prophecies. Grant us but one more blessing -- Take back the gift of our holiness. The SOUND of angry voices from outside the bunker.
ARKADY	Next time, I cut off your nose, pisher. Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his
TUVIA	Whassa problem, Arkady?
ARKADY	Those who risk their lives to bring back food deserve a larger portion than those who risk nothing.
ASAEL	Everyone gets the same portion.
ARKADY	Not when you're serving, pisher. I see you digging to the bottom of the pot for your little forest cutie and her parents...
ASAEL	She is my wife!
TUVIA	Policy is...Same for all. If someone is stealing he'll face consequences. Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public
ASAEL	What consequences? Others are closely watching this test of Tuvia's authority.
TUVIA	Reduced rations for one week. Both of you.
TUVIA	
TUVIA (CONT'D)	This matter is settled. Everybody back in line. People are staring at him.
LINE!	His eyes meet Lilka's. She looks away. Asael takes Tuvia's
ASAEL	Tuvia, I would never--
TUVIA	Yes. I know.
ASAEL	Then why am I to be punished...? Tuvia just takes another swallow from his bottle.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Fischer is with them. So is Levine. On food missions, they take first for themselves and only bring back what's left over-- Tuvia's head is throbbing. He closes his eyes.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	--and they spread rumors, that you are power-hungry and corrupt, that you take whatever woman you choose-- --that we keep gold for ourselves, and that-- He stops himself.
TUVIA	--What?
ASAEL	...that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us.
TUVIA	.Maybe they're right. Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized.
ASAEL	Zus would have punched him senseless.
TUVIA	Zus.
ASAEL	I miss him.
Ã TUVIA	He has made his choice. He reels away toward the woods.
SHIMON	Drink this. From the bottom of the pot. Tuvia can barely get the soup down.
TUVIA	...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway.
SHIMON	Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage.
TUVIA	...Moses.
SHIMON	So I'm a sucker for a biblical allusion. But what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter.
TUVIA	I am not a leader.
SHIMON	Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed to work out. Several partisans are singing a drinking song while Zus
ZUS	Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands.
ZUS (CONT'D)	Lova. Tell me. Who?
LOVA	Gramov. Two others. I used the officer's latrine.
ZUS	For this they beat you? Lova is trying not to weep.
LOVA	They said they wouldn't shit in the same hole as a Jew. Zus gets to his feet.
ZUS	Forgive me, Commander.
PANCHENKO	Zus. Join us. He offers him a glass of vodka. Zus doesn't take it.
ZUS	I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade. Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye. This man beat Comrade Lova -- for no reason at all.
GRAMOV	I had a perfectly good reason. He is a Jew. The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov.
PANCHENKO	--and you are an ignorant Tartar. Ignore him. Here...
ZUS	Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this?
PANCHENKO	He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew.
GRAMOV	I apologize, Jew.
PANCHENKO	There. You see? Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka.
LILKA	Your fever broke in the night. The medicine helped.
TUVIA	How long was I asleep?
LILKA	Two days.
TUVIA	And you've nursed me the whole time?
LILKA	Chaya helped.
TUVIA	Did you study nursing at university?
LILKA	We devoted ourselves to more essential knowledge -- like Greek Philosophy and Latin.
TUVIA	I never went to university.
LILKA	What kind of work did you do? Before.
TUVIA	My wife's father had a store. Before the Race Laws. She is is dead.
LILKA	I'm sorry.
TUVIA	Tell me more about university.
LILKA	It all feels like a dream. I spent months trying to master Chopin's nocturnes.
TUVIA	I'd love to hear you play.
LILKA	You know Chopin?
TUVIA	Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok. If you're well enough to tease me, you're well enough to eat. I'll see what's for supper. She gets up to go.
TUVIA	Thank you, Lilka.
127 OUTSIDE TUVIA'S BUNKER 127	THE LUBCZANSKI'S have taken the fullest advantage of Tuvia's The malbushim line up like prison inmates. Lazar looks into
IN THE SHORTER LINE	Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine and a few others are enjoying
LAZAR	Hey, Arkady This isn't soup, it's piss.
ARKADY	I will piss on your head and you will say it's raining. Eat it. The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs.
TUVIA	What happened? Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has
TUVIA (CONT'D)	What is this?
ARKADY	New policy. Fighters get better food.
TUVIA	Against my orders...
ARKADY	You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment.
TUVIA	As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands. THEY LEAVE. NOW! The rest work. Every morning we get up and we work. WE WORK. In the snow and the cold and the dark. Tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka, we double the number of food missions. ...We work. Take his body into the woods and leave it for the wolves. He turns and walks away. As he passes the food lines, people

131 THE SUNSHINE IS WARM 131	on the women's bodies as they bathe in the river.
CHAYA	Who has the soap? I know there was a little left?
BELLA	Use the sand. It's good for your skin.
RIVA	And what skin! And already married, too! Bella laughs. Chaya splashes her playfully with water.
BELLA	I've turned into a skeleton.
CHAYA	And you were always so worried about staying slim.
BELLA	When we get out of this forest I am going to eat only cake and grow as big as a house. Tamara appears. She's wearing a long overcoat.
LILKA	Join us. At least the sun is warm. Tamara?
TAMARA	I can't, Lilka... I'm pregnant.
LILKA	I had no idea.
TAMARA	I've kept it hidden for months but now it's obvious. No one can know. They move away from the others. Tamara shows her.
TAMARA (CONT'D)	It could come any day.
LILKA	..Who is the father?
TAMARA	I--- It was when I was escaping. A man with a gun stopped me. I thought he was a Partisan. He told me to follow him and he took me to this place... The memory overwhelms her. She begins to break down.
TAMARA (CONT'D)	Inside me something broke....I wanted to die. Every night I have nightmares -- what will happen when Tuvia finds out.
LILKA	He will understand.
TAMARA	No. You mustn't tell him!
LILKA	I won't. Don't worry. What are you going to do? Tamara's eyes fill with a new resolve.
TAMARA	I feel this new life inside me. It's the only thing keeping me going. I won't give it up, I'll kill myself. Lilka puts her arm around her. where Shimon and Malbin are playing chess. Shimon has
MALBIN	You call that a move?
SHIMON	I call it an inevitable conclusion based on unimpeachable reasoning.
SHIMON (CONT'D)	The question, my friend the Genius, is what are you going to do about it.
MALBIN	I'm thinking about what I'm going to do about it.
SHIMON	Aha! I got him!
MALBIN	You didn't get me. You think you got me? How about this? Who would make a move like that?
MALBIN	A genius maybe. Tuvia has been listening nearby. Aron races into the camp.
ARON	Tuvia... We SEE Aron whispering in Tuvia's ear.
TUVIA	Asael! Asael comes running.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Get a message to Zus. He's got to tell Viktor they're coming.
ASAEL	Lazar spotted another patrol. They're getting closer. Tuvia nods. Suddenly, he HEARS a strange sound. An animal?
TUVIA	Do you hear that? We HEAR the SOUND for what it is... The cry of a newborn.
135 OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 135	Tuvia walks angrily. Lilka keeps up.
LILKA	She promises not to take extra food...
TUVIA	This is against my orders.
LILKA	So you are going to shoot her, too? Tuvia stares at her. He has never seen this side of her.
LILKA (CONT'D)	Please, Tuvia. The baby is all she has to live for.
TUVIA	I cannot allow it. He turns away. Lilka SPINS him around, surprising him with her strength
LILKA	You must let it live!
TUVIA	I cannot keep the living alive. Tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate.
LILKA	She was raped by the Nazis. Tuvia closes his eyes. He is tired of being in charge,
LILKA (CONT'D)	...You tell us to hold onto our humanity. Not to become like animals. What better way than by bringing a life into this world of suffering and death. It's our only hope. Tuvia is undone by her intensity. The very nearness of He looks at her. And nods in surrender.
LILKA (CONT'D)	Thank you, Tuvia. She kisses him. A chaste kiss of gratitude.
TUVIA	Lilka...
LILKA	I knew what was expected of the women here -- yet you never touched me...
TUVIA	Shhh..
LILKA	I'm not afraid of anything, Tuvia. I'm not even afraid of you. They kiss deeply. Lilka lies in his arms.
TUVIA	The Germans are coming into the forest. I don't know what is going to become of us.
LILKA	It doesn't matter. If I had stayed in the ghetto I'd be dead. You saved my life.
TUVIA	No. You have saved mine. He reaches for her but before they can begin to make love
MALBIN	Oh... ..I..... Hello, Lilka.
LILKA	Hello, Asael.
TUVIA	Yes?
MALBIN	We've caught one.
ASAEL	He's a scout.
TUVIA	They're coming for us. Group members have begun to gather around him. They begin
ASAEL	We found this in his pouch. He hands Tuvia a sheaf of documents -- including a map.
TUVIA	Entrance points, wetlands, obstacles. You read this.
SHIMON	They've assigned an entire division to surround the forest. A tidal wave is coming.
ASAEL	Don't they have a war to fight?
SHIMON	Assault begins in two days. Passover. How fitting. Meanwhile, some of the group have begun TORMENTING the man.
MOTL	Monster! He kicks him in the head.
SHULMAN	Bulvan! Shulman PUNCHES him in the face.
GERMAN COURIER	Bitte....Bitte...
TUVIA	Did you reach Viktor?
ASAEL	He's on his way. The tormenting of the poor courier is gaining intensity. The German lets loose a torrent of pleading.
GERMAN COURIER	Ich habe frau und kinder!
SHIMON	He says he has a wife and children. Lazar picks up a stick. The German tries to crawl away;
LAZAR	So did I!
RIVA	If you let him go, he will lead them back here. Tuvia looks at Malbin. What to do?
MALBIN	Ask if he'll promise not to reveal our location. Shimon translates.
SHIMON	Sie mussen versprechen nicht zu sagan wo wir sind. The man looks up at him, pleadingly.
GERMAN COURIER	Nein....Nein...
SHULMAN	He'll say anything. He breaks the stick across the man's back.
LAZAR	We want justice...
MOTL	Justice... Soon it is a chant: "Justice! .Justice!" Tuvia looks at
BELLA	My son's name was David. David Kagan. We SEE now that she is holding a sharpened hoe.
BELLA (CONT'D)	He was fifteen. He had blue eyes. She raises it above her head.
BELLA (CONT'D)	He played the piano. She swings with all her might. The others watch with a mix
RIVA	My sister's name was Ellie... As she swings the shovel, the CAMERA begins to back away.
MIRIAM	My husband was Meyer... The group closes in, obscuring our view of the body. Aron
MOTL	My parents, Sol and Raya.
AVRAM	For my daughter, Sonya.
MORDECAI	For my mother.
RACHEL	My sister.
LILKA	My whole family. Tuvia closes his eyes. He has done nothing to stop it. Behind them, the group separates -- staring at the lifeless
TUVIA	Reeboynoy shel oylum... Lord of the Universe. We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy... He HEARS something. Malbin waits at the edge of the forest.
MALBIN	Viktor is here.
139 VIKTOR AND ZUS 139	are waiting in the clearing. Tuvia approaches. He and Zus
ZUS	He doesn't look good.
ASAEL	I could say the same about you. Where'd you get the jacket?
ZUS	Let's just say the former owner no longer had need of it. Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively. Embrace me. Asael looks confused for a moment, then embraces him. Hide this. Wolnicky stores ammunition for us in his barn. There's no guard. He slaps Asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his comrades.
140 VIKTOR AND TUVIA 140	sit on a downed tree and converse in Russian, with subtitles:
VIKTOR	You found these on the prisoner? Tuvia nods. Viktor studies the scout's documents. Tisking.
TUVIA	We can't fight an entire division.
VIKTOR	The battle on the Eastern Front has begun. The more troops we engage here, the fewer they have to attack the Motherland.
TUVIA	We've done our part for the Motherland.
VIKTOR	My orders are to take command of all partisan operations. You will bring the rest of your fighters to me.
TUVIA	And the others? Old people, women and children.
VIKTOR	In war there are casualties.
TUVIA	And if I refuse?
VIKTOR	You are officially a deserter. Do you know the policy on dealing with deserters? Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket.
VIKTOR (CONT'D)	...The Germans are offering fifty thousand marks for information leading to your capture. Not a very flattering likeness. Too Jewish. Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a last word.
VIKTOR (CONT'D)	Have your men in my camp by tonight. He walks off. Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia.
ASAEL	I wouldn't show this around. There are some who'd turn you in for less.
ZUS	You want them to find Tuvia's camp. Viktor just looks at him.
ZUS (CONT'D)	You're deliberately sacrificing them so we can remain safe?
VIKTOR	No. So we can keep fighting. Everyone must sacrifice in the struggle.
ZUS	Those are my brothers.
VIKTOR	I am your brother! He is your brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but counter-revolutionary. Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips
SHIMON	...but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in God.' He will take care of you' And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries. Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face.
MALBIN	Did it see us?
TUVIA	Tomorrow is Passover. Yes?
MALBIN	...How should I know?
TUVIA	Moses. The Exodus. Malbin doesn't get it at first. --He left before Pharaoh could stop them. Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon.
MALBIN	You want to move them all? The old, the sick. They'll never make it. It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their
TUVIA	We leave now. Spread the word.
ASAEL	Come, tateh--
OPPENHEIM	But my tools-- The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky. The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People Some race into the forest; others are frozen. Tuvia grabs STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground. Several people are hit before they can reach cover. Lilka

MALBIN	Are you alright? Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear. When Tuvia speaks, his WORDS sound DULL and MUFFLED. Malbin looks around, panicked. Asael appears out of the
ASAEL	Get them out of the bunkers! Malbin runs off. Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby We need to hold them off...until the rest are safe. Tuvia still can't hear. Asael pantomimes firing a rifle. Tuvia nods, trying to clear the buzzing in his head.
ASAEL	With Levine and Miriam... There. Lazar, Rosa, and Schmuel. There and there. And me. Tuvia shakes his head, no.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Yes. He runs off. Still clearing his head, Tuvia regains his
151 AT THE ENTRY WAY TO A ZEMYLANKA 151	
MALBIN	Everybody out! Now! But the group's natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety This gets the job done. People begin to crawl out. Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children
TUVIA	Don't try to fight... Just slow them down. Then join us. Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely.
ASAEL	Take her. She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment.
TUVIA	Come. He forces her to join him and catch up to the others.
154 THE CAMP 154	is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle. The defenders Tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on. SUDDENLY -- A FUSILLADE from the woods. Rosa falls dead.

161 BACK TO THE FLEEING GROUP 161	Tuvia hears the guns go silent. This, too, has meaning.
MALBIN	Oh, my God...
TUVIA	Are the others back yet? ..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back.
SHULMAN	We've got to keep going!
BELLA	The Germans will be here any minute!
MALBIN	Do we wait...a while?
MORDECAI	We could hide...
MAN #3	I say, fight them here.
MOTL	Yes. Fight!
SHULMAN	That's crazy! Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all

SHULMAN	We'll put them on our shoulders.
BELLA	Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying. And still Tuvia is silent. More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising.
MALBIN (CONT'D)	What's wrong with him?
SHIMON	...He... ..is... ..tired. Malbin hears something, looks up. She takes his hand silently. He shakes his head.
TUVIA	You have a weapon? She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks Use it on yourself before you let them take you. She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts.
VOICE	Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands They're coming! Why aren't we moving? Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless. We must keep going!
TAMARA	In there?
RONA	It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises his voice.
ASAEL	Nothing is impossible! What we have done is impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older
ASAEL (CONT'D)	God will not part these waters. We will do it ourselves.
RONA	But how?
ASAEL	Not by miracles. By our strength.
ASAEL (CONT'D)	Take the rope from your pack. Now, you....give me your belt.
SHULMAN	We don't have enough rope.
ASAEL	We'll link arms. Make a chain. A human chain.

TUVIA	Come... Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no.
MALBIN	Is he...? Tuvia shakes his head. It's only a matter of time. The
TUVIA	Take off your glasses. Reflections. Tuvia moves off to check on the others.
MALBIN	Shimon, listen to me, the physical plane is just an illusion. Only the spiritual plane is real.
SHIMON	No. The physical plane is where man acts to redeem himself.
MALBIN	You've redeemed yourself enough, you should shut up now.
SHIMON	Look who's talking about shutting up... I need to tell you something.
MALBIN	What is it?
SHIMON	You shouldn't think so much. The world around you is beautiful.
MALBIN	This world?
SHIMON	Even this one. Tuvia has come to sit beside Lilka. She leans into him.
TUVIA	We're lost.
LILKA	No. ..No. She puts her arms around him. They hold each other and drift off to sleep.
FROM NEARBY	The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the
TUVIA	Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line. Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them
PANCHENKO	You will hold this crossroads until the brigade has completed its retreat. Zus looks around at the position.
ZUS	For how long? Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned.
PANCHENKO	Until you are ordered to withdraw.
ZUS	And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a
PANCHENKO	Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline, if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats.
PANCHENKO (CONT'D)	You have served us well, Comrade.
ZUS	I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of
LOVA	What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view.
LOVA (CONT'D)	Tell me. Who are we doing this for? With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows empties at last into a shallow river. On the opposite bank
169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169	Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there,

SHIMON	.Tuvia...
TUVIA	Right here. Shimon is at the end.
SHIMON	...Something...to say...
TUVIA	Shhhh...
SHIMON	...no...please... I almost lost...my faith....but you...were sent..by God..to save us.
TUVIA	Ridiculous.
SHIMON	I know... ... But just...in case... .I thank....HIM... .and I thank you. He closes his eyes. It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop
A PANZER TANK	emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away. The menacing gun turning in their direction.
TUVIA	Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children. Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round
UP AHEAD	A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is
TUVIA	Only weapons and ammunition! Spread the word. Tuvia hands him the machine gun.
ASAEL	Anything else? Tuvia looks at him. Is he fucking with him? Just a little.
TUVIA	Go on. Lilka is carrying a small child.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Lilka, please help. We've got to get the injured into the forest.
LILKA	What about the dead?
TUVIA	Everybody gather your things! We have to get out of the open! Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Shulman! Weapons only! Tell them. Shulman follows Tuvia's order.
TUVIA (CONT'D)	You've been promoted. Congratulations! Tuvia turns, sees Bella with Zus. They see him. Zus hands
TUVIA (CONT'D)	Where is the rest of your unit?
ZUS	Good question.
TUVIA	You are going back?
ZUS	No. They look at each other. So much unsaid. No time to say
