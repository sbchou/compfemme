CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
COMMENTARY	..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years old, arriving at the polling station of his constituency in Sedgefield.."
ELIZABETH	Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford? Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they opened. First in line. Seven o'clock. Prime Minister in almost two hundred years.."
ARTIST	And I don't mind telling you, it wasn't for Mr Blair.
ELIZABETH	Not a moderniser, then?
ARTIST	Certainly not. We're in danger of losing too much that's good about this country as it is.
TV COMMENTARY	"The only questions that still remain: how big will his landslide be? And how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?"
ELIZABETH	Hmm.
ELIZABETH	I rather envy you being able to vote. Not the actual ticking of the box, although, I suppose, it would be nice to experience that ONCE. But the sheer joy of being partial.
ARTIST	Yes..
ARTIST	One forgets that as Sovereign, you are not entitled to vote.
ELIZABETH	No.
ARTIST	Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am.. But it IS your Government.
ELIZABETH	Yes.
ELIZABETH	I suppose that is some consolation.
MAID	G'morning, Ma'am.
DRESSER	Shall I draw the curtains? Did you stay up?
DRESSER	Yes, Ma'am. And? Was it as expected..?
RESSER	Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.
ELIZABETH	I see.
JANVRIN	The Prime Minister is on his way, Ma'am.
ELIZABETH	To BE, Robin. Prime Minister to BE.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	He hasn't asked my permission yet.
ELIZABETH	He's a hard one to read, isn't he?
JANVRIN	Yes. On the one hand his background is quite establishment. Father a Conservative. A public school education at Fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales.
ELIZABETH	Well, we'll try not to hold that against him.
JANVRIN	On the other, his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three hundred years.
ELIZABETH	Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do you think?
JANVRIN	I wouldn't put it past him. He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met. It could best be described as `shallow'.
ELIZABETH	I don't measure the depth of a curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my sister.
JANVRIN	And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal. Everyone on first name terms. At the Prime Minister's insistence.
ELIZABETH	What? As in `Call me Tony?'
JANVRIN	Yes.
ELIZABETH	Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of that. Have we sent him a protocol sheet?
TONY	Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.
HERIE	hy? You've met her often enough before.
TONY	I know. But never one to one. And never as Prime Minister.
CHERIE	Remember, you're a man that's just been elected by the whole country. T TONY Yes. But she's still, y'know..
TONY	The Queen.
EQUERRY	When we reach the audience room, I will knock. We will not wait to be called, we will go straight inside. Standing by the door, we bow. From the neck. I will introduce you. The Queen will extend her hand, you go to her, bow again, then shake her hand.
QUERRY (cont'd)	Couple of other things. It's `Ma'am' as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm.
TONY	Yes..
EQUERRY	And when you're in the Presence, at no point must you show your back. The `Presence'?
EQUERRY	Yes, Sir. That's what it's called, when you're in her Majesty's company.
EQUERRY	Mr Blair, your Majesty.
ELIZABETH	ongratulations.
TONY	Thank you, Ma'am.
ELIZABETH	Your children must be very proud.
TONY	I hope so.
ELIZABETH	You've three, haven't you?
TONY	That's right.
ELIZABETH	How lovely. Such a blessing. Children.
ELIZABETH	So..Have we shown you how to start a nuclear war yet?
TONY	No.
ELIZABETH	First thing we do, I believe. Then we take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the world.
TONY	You obviously know my job better than I do.
ELIZABETH	Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister, Mr Blair. I'd like to think there weren't too many surprises left. My first was Winston Churchill. He sat in your chair, in frock coat and top hat, and was kind enough to give a shy T young girl like me quite an education.
TONY	I can imagine.
ELIZABETH	ith time, one has hopefully added experience to that education, and a little wisdom - better enabling us to execute our constitutional responsibility. To advise, guide and warn the government of the day.
TONY	Advice which I look forward to receiving.
ELIZABETH	ell, we will save that for our weekly meetings. Now, if there's nothing else, I believe we have some business to attend to..
TONY	Of course.. Your Majesty, the country has spoken...and I come now to ask your permiss.. E
ELIZABETH	No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask the questions.
ELIZABETH	Mr Blair, the people have elected you to be their leader. And so the duty falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask you to become Prime Minister, and form a government in my name.
ELIZABETH	Generally, this is where you say `yes.'
TONY	`Yes'.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	You must be very proud.
HERIE	Yes.
ELIZABETH	And exhausted, I imagine. Where will you be spending the summer?
CHERIE	France.
ELIZABETH	How lovely.
TONY	ou'll be in Balmoral, I expect.
ELIZABETH	Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful place.
ELIZABETH	My great, great grandmother said of it - "In Balmoral all seems to breathe freedom and peace and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils." Really..?
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there.
ELIZABETH	Not too short, was it? I gave him fifteen minutes. One doesn't want to be rude.
CHERIE	"Thank you so much for coming. Now bugger off."
TONY	I know. What was all that about?
CHERIE	Diana. Apparently she's got a new boyfriend. ARCHIVE TELEVISION NEWS FOOTAGE
CNN NEWSREADER	Dodi Al-Fayed is the son of Egyptian millionaire Mohammed Al-Fayed, a man whom the English establishment has repeatedly denied a British passport..
GERMAN NEWSREADER	The Princess and Mr Fayed were hugging and kissing in full view of the world's press yesterday..
FRENCH NEWSREADER	..the couple then left for Paris. At one point, the Princess told gathered reporters to watch out. Her next move would really surprise them...
RENCH REPORTER	..the Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed returned to Paris earlier today..
ERMAN REPORTER	..where they visited a local jewellery shop where unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Fayed had been looking at engagement rings.. German REPORTER continues..
GERMAN REPORTER	...they have now been inside the hotel for more than two hours. We believe they have been dining in a suite on the fifth floor..
AMERICAN REPORTER	We've just been told the Princess is about to come out of the hotel..
PAUL	Don't bother following. You won't catch us.
JANVRIN	Robin Janvrin. What? Right. I see. I'm going to need to speak to her Majesty. Right away.
JANVRIN	Tell Sir Guy I'd like everyone in. As soon as possible.
DRESSER	Ma'am?
DRESSER	Mr Janvrin is here to see you..
ELIZABETH	Oh..
PRINCE PHILIP	What the..?
JANVRIN	Good evening, Ma'am. I'm sorry to disturb..
JANVRIN	I 've just had a call from our Embassy in Paris. It's...the Princess of Wales.
PRINCE PHILIP	Why? What's she done now?
TONY	What? How badly?
TONY	I see. Who are we speaking to there?
TONY	Right. Keep me posted.
TONY	It's Diana. She's been in a car accident. In Paris.
CHERIE	Is it serious?
TONY	Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.
CHERIE	What?
NEWSREADER	Let's just re-cap on what's happened.
PRINCE PHILIP	What was she doing in Paris?
ELIZABETH	ou know what she's like. It's quite awful... What are you going to do about the boys?
CHARLES	Let them sleep until we know more.
ELIZABETH	Yes that's sensible.
CHARLES	I should go to Paris. I told my people to start organising a jet.
ELIZABETH	What? A private one?
HARLES	Yes.
ELIZABETH	Isn't that precisely the sort of extravagance they attack us for?
CHARLES	ell, how else am I going to get to Paris at this time of night? The airport at Aberdeen will be closed.
QUEEN MOTHER	You can use the Royal Flight. They keep one of the planes on permanent stand-by. In case I kick the bucket.
ELIZABETH	Out of the question. It's not a matter of State.
HARLES	What are you talking about?
ELIZABETH	Diana is no longer an HRH, nor a member of the Royal Family. This is a private matter.
CHARLES	She's mother to your grandchildren.
QUEEN MOTHER	That's the latest?
PRINCE PHILIP	I don't know. I can't hear.. Everyone's shouting!
TELEVISION	..behind me, is the tunnel of the Pont de l'Alma, which you reach by the expressway along the Seine. It was along here that the Mercedes carrying the Princess..
SECRETARY	The Ambassador, in Paris.
JANVRIN	Good evening, Sir.
JANVRIN	Right. I see.
JANVRIN	I've just spoken to our Ambassador in Paris, Ma'am. I'm afraid it's not good news.
CHARLES	No!
CHARLES	No, no, no, no..!
NEWSREADER	We have just had confirmation, that ..has died in Paris.
CNN ANCHOR	"I'm afraid we have some bad news to report.."
NN ANCHOR	"Diana, Princess of Wales, is dead."
TONY	What have I got on this week?
ALASTAIR	You're writing your maiden Conference speech as Prime Minister.
TONY	Well, let's cancel everything else. I'd better make a statement in the morning.
ALASTAIR	You'll be pleased to know I've already started coming up with ideas.
TONY	God, she's only been dead an hour!
ALASTAIR	Would you prefer I didn't do my job?
CHARLES	They're going to go back to sleep. Well, try anyway.
CHARLES	My Private Secretary's office has found a travel agency open in New York that will sell me a flight to Paris with an hour's stop over in Manchester.
CHARLES	Perhaps now you might consider whether it's still an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future King of England in one of our planes?
ELIZABETH	All right.
ELIZABETH	I don't want the boys to see the news and get upset. First thing tomorrow morning, I want the radio taken out of their bedroom, and the television taken out of the nursery.
O	utside, the sound of bird-song. The first rays of light.
PRINCE PHILIP	Well, well, well.
ELIZABETH	Ye-es.
PRINCE PHILIP	Are you all right? Your sister called about an hour ago. From Tuscany.
ELIZABETH	hope you told her to come back? Cut the holiday short?
PRINCE PHILIP	I did.
ELIZABETH	an't imagine she was pleased.
PRINCE PHILIP	That's putting it mildly.
ELIZABETH	What did she say?
PRINCE PHILIP	Something about Diana managing to be even more annoying dead than alive.
ELIZABETH	Just make sure the boys never hear you talk like that.
PRINCE PHILIP	Of course. Something to help you go down?
ELIZABETH	No. I'm going to do my diary a little longer.
PRINCE PHILIP	Fine. I'll sleep next door. Victorian, red-brick house. In the driveway, the
TONY	"..that's how she will remain. In our minds, our hearts, forever." OK, got it.
ALASTAIR	Where will you do it?
TONY	I thought at church. On the way in.
S	...this is not a time for recriminations, however I would say that I always believed that the press would kill her in the end. But even I could not imagine that they would take such a direct hand in her death as seems to be the case. It would appear that every proprietor and editor of every publication that has paid for intrusive and exploitative photographs of her has blood on his hands today...
ALASTAIR	Not the press, mate. You've got the wrong villain.
TONY	I've got to go.
ALASTAIR	You about to speak to the Queen?
TONY	Yes.
ALASTAIR	Ask her if SHE greased the brakes.
TONY	Now, now..
T	hey set CHARLES's place and his breakfast, (nuts, grains,
JANVRIN	I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am, but I've the Prime Minister, for you. From his constituency.
QUEEN MOTHER	Lucky you.
ELIZABETH	Thank you, Robin. I'll take it next door. T he QUEEN gets to her feet and walks out into..
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	Good morning, Prime Minister.
TONY	Good morning, your Majesty. May I say right away how very sorry I am - and that the thoughts and prayers of my family are with you at this terrible time and with the two princes in particular.
ELIZABETH	Thank you.
TONY	Is it your intention to make some kind of appearance. Or statement?
ELIZABETH	Certainly not.
ELIZABETH	No member of the Royal family will speak publicly about this. It is a private matter and we would all appreciate it if it could be respected as such.
TONY	I see.
TONY	I don't suppose anyone has had time to think about the funeral yet?
ELIZABETH	We've spoken to the Spencer family, and it's their wish.. ..their express wish, that it should be a private funeral. With a memorial service to follow in a month, or so.
TONY	Right.
ELIZABETH	Given that Diana was no longer a member of the Royal Family we have no choice but to respect their wishes.
TONY	I see.
TONY	You don't feel that in view of her high profile and popularity.. ...it might be an idea to pay tribute to her life and achievements? Or even just to her as a mother?
ELIZABETH	As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.
TONY (cont'd)	And the public, Ma'am? The British People?
TONY	You don't think a private funeral would be denying them a chance..
ELIZABETH	hance to what..?
TONY	To share in the grief?
ELIZABETH	It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not a fairground attraction. I think the Princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press, don't you? Now, if there is nothing else I must get on. The children have to be looked after.
TONY	Of course.
TONY (cont'd)	Good bye, Your Majesty. He puts down the phone...
TONY	Her instinct is to do nothing. Say nothing. And give her a private funeral.
CHERIE	Are you surprised? She hated her guts.
TONY	Well, I think it's a mistake.
TONY	They screwed up her life. Let's hope they don't screw up her death.
ELIZABETH	The Chaplain called. Wanted to know whether he should make any changes to the service or make special mention of Diana.
PRINCE PHILIP	What did you say?
ELIZABETH	I told him he shouldn't change a thing.
UEEN MOTHER	
Q	uite right.
ELIZABETH	I think the less fuss one makes, or draws attention to it, the better. she lowers her voice, as the PRINCES approach from For the boys.
QUEEN MOTHER	Yes.
ELIZABETH	And we should probably arrange some company for them. Some young people.
PRINCE PHILIP	I'll take them for a long walk this afternoon. Up Craggy Head.
ELIZABETH	Good. They'd like that. But no guns. It's Sunday.
AIDE	Alastair? He's on..
TONY	e are today a nation in a state of shock, in mourning, in grief that is so deeply painful to us. People everywhere, not just here in Britain, kept faith with Princess Diana.. Our camera stays on JANVRIN's face, as TONY's speech
TONY (ON TV)	They liked her, they loved her, they regarded her as one of the people. She was the people's princess, and that is how she will stay, how she will remain in our hearts and memories forever.." J ANVRIN's eyes roll privately..
JANVRIN	A bit over the top, don't you think?
PRIEST	Notre Pere qui es aux cieux, Que ton nom soit sanctifie, Que ton regne vienne, Que ta volonte soit faite, S ur la terre comme au ciel.. I'll always be glad I knew the Princess, and hope everyone will support her two fine sons and help them have the life and the future she would want..
MANDELA (ON TV)	I had the honour of hosting her a few months ago when she visited our country, and I was tremendously impressed by her.. In cities all around the world, shrines have been created, in a spontaneous, worldwide outpouring of grief.
IDE	Lord Airlie.
A	TONY shoots a look, `Who?' The AIDE covers the phone..
IDE	The Lord Chamberlain. In charge of the funeral. You're meeting him at the airport.
TONY	Lord Airlie.
AIRLIE	Prime Minister. I'm responsible for organising all royal ceremonial events... And there's simply no precedent for the funeral of an ex-HRH.
TONY	Then perhaps we should plan for any contingency.
ORD AIRLIE	Yes. I've arranged a meeting tomorrow morning at 10.00 at Buckingham Palace. Officials from all three palaces, representatives from the Spencer Family, the emergency services. Would you send some of your people?
TONY	Absolutely. Of course.
TONY	`Preeecedent?'
TONY	Where do they find these people?
TONY	I'm so sorry, Sir. And if there's anything I or my Government can do...
CHARLES	They stood up as we drove past...in cafes...in restaurants. Removed their hats. This was Paris. One of the busiest cities in the world...and you could hear a pin drop...
TONY	I imagine it will be the same here.
CHARLES	Yes...I imagine it will.
CHARLES	The Palace would still prefer to see it as a private funeral. What are your feelings on that?
TONY	I... I think that would present us with difficulties. C HARLES So do I. My mother.. ...the Queen, comes from a generation not best equipped to... ...she grew up in the war... I think what we need, what the COUNTRY needs is to be led by someone.."of today". If you follow? Balmoral is..
TONY	I think I understand.
ELIZABETH	Have we heard from the Spencers again? Have they made up their minds when the funeral will be?
QUEEN MOTHER	Not me. No one tells me anything.
NEWSREADER (V.O.)	The Prince of Wales spent half an hour at the hospital. At 5.06, the party left with Diana's coffin..
PRINCE PHILIP	n our walk today, one of the ghillies said he'd seen a large stag up at Craghie Head. He reckoned fourteen points.
QUEEN MOTHER	What? Really? We haven't had one that big on this estate in years.
PRINCE PHILIP	No. Quite.
EWSREADER (V.O.)	Diana's coffin arrived back in London, at RAF Northolt, two hours later..
PRINCE PHILIP	nyway, I thought it might be a good distraction. For the boys.
ELIZABETH	What? Stalking?
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	Isn't it a bit soon?
PRINCE PHILIP	I think anything that gets them outside is a good idea. arlier today, the Prime Minister made a statement from his constituency..
TONY (ON TV)	"They liked her. They loved her. They regarded her as one of the People. She was the People's Princess, and that is how she will remain in our hearts forever.."
ELIZABETH	I'm sorry, I can't bear it. I'm going to bed. L ORD AIRLIE, (whom we met at RAF Northolt), checks the time.
LORD AIRLIE	Right. It's ten o'clock. Let's make a start. Thank you all for coming at such notice. I think we all agree this is an extraordinarily sensitive occasion which presents us with tremendous challenges logistically... ...constitutionally.. ..practically... ...diplomatically.. ...procedurally...
ALASTAIR	Oh, Christ..
TONY	"..after eighteen years of Opposition, of frustration and despair, I am proud, privileged, to stand before you as the new Prime Minister..."
IDE	Labour Prime Minister..
TONY	"I want to set an ambitious course to modernise this country. To breathe new life into our institutions. To make privilege something for the many, not the few. So that we become nothing less than a beacon to the world..." A LASTAIR Bloody hell! You think the Royals are nutters! You should meet their flunkeys! Two and a half-hours on whether she should be carried in a hearse or a gun-carriage. Anyway, raves in the press.
ALASTAIR	This lot call you "The Nation's Mourner in Chief", this lot say you're "The only person who has correctly judged the mood of the country". Even the "Mail".. ..was impressed.
LASTAIR	"People's Princess", mate. You owe me.
AIDE	Gordon for you.
TONY	Tell him to hang on.
TONY (cont'd)	So it's decided? It's going to be a public funeral.
LASTAIR	Yes. On Saturday. A whopper. The Abbey. The works.
TONY	Good. Has anyone told the Queen yet?
LASTAIR	Dunno. No doubt some flunkey will be despatched. Grovelling on all fours.
JANVRIN	Good morning, Ma'am. J ANVRIN ..Ma'am.
ELIZABETH	What can we do for you, Robin?
JANVRIN	Ma'am, there was a meeting at the Palace this morning.
ELIZABETH	About the funeral arrangements, yes.
JANVRIN	The Lord Chamberlain faxed over these plans for you to consider.
JANVRIN	There is now general agreement, Ma'am, that a public funeral would be more appropriate.
ELIZABETH	I see.
ELIZABETH	nd what form will it take?
JANVRIN	At the moment, they're suggesting.. And of course these are early days.. ...basing it on Tay Bridge.
QUEEN MOTHER	Tay Bridge..?
ELIZABETH	What..? A stunned silence..
QUEEN MOTHER	B-but that's the code name for my funeral? J
ANVRIN	ndeed, Ma'am. But it would be for practical reasons only.
ANVRIN	It's the only one which has been.. ..`rehearsed'. The only one that could be put together..in time.
QUEEN MOTHER	But I supervised those plans myself.
JANVRIN	Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different. For example, in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin, the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the Princess's various charities march behind the coffin.
ELIZABETH	I see..
JANVRIN	And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other.. ...celebrities..
QUEEN MOTHER	Celebrities..?
ELIZABETH	Oh. Wa..was there anything else?
JANVRIN	o, Ma'am.
JANVRIN	Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police Commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book. It would give the growing crowds something to do. Make marshalling them easier.
ELIZABETH	Yes, of course..
JANVRIN	Oh, and the flowers.
ELIZABETH	W hat flowers? The flowers that have been left outside Buckingham palace. Currently they're blocking the path through the main gate, and will make things difficult for the Changing of the Guard.
ELIZABETH	Fine. Then move them away.
JANVRIN	Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was wondering whether we shouldn't leave the flowers, and send the Guards through the North Gate.
ELIZABETH	Ye-es. Of course. Quite right.
AIDE	tephen Lamport on one.
TONY	Who?
AIDE	The Prince of Wales's private secretary. In Balmoral. He said it was urgent.
TONY	ood afternoon.
LAMPORT (V.O.)	Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
LAMPORT	The Prince of Wales wanted me to thank you again for your kind words yesterday.
TONY	Not at all.
AMPORT	He feels you and he...are modern men...of similar mind... ...who could work well together at this difficult time.
TONY	Well, please thank his Highness, and assure him that he can count on my full support. At all times. Was that it?
LAMPORT	Yes. Bizarre. Why is Charles doing this?
AIDE	What?
TONY	Creeping up to me like this. He did it at the airport when he asked me to `deal' with his mother. ecause he knows that if the Queen continues to get it wrong over Diana, it won't be long before the Royals become public enemy no 1. Terrified of being shot, apparently.
TONY	Who, Charles?
AIDE	His people have already been onto us asking for extra protection.
IDE #2	He probably thinks if he's seen to be on our side, the Queen will be the one left in the firing line, not him.
TONY	What? So it's OK for his mother to take the bullet, not him? What a family.
CHARLES	Wait! Where are they?
ELIZABETH	Up at Craigghead.
CHARLES	I'll come with you.
CHARLES (cont'd)	Want me to drive?
ELIZABETH	Certainly not.
CHARLES	I thought you were going to get a new E one of these?
ELIZABETH	What for? It's perfectly all right.
CHARLES	I was thinking last night what Diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris.
CHARLES	She would certainly have taken the boys to Paris. I rather regret not doing that now.
ELIZABETH	What? And expose them to the media? It would have been a dreadful thing to do. They're much better off here.
CHARLES	Look, whatever else you may have thought of Diana - she was a wonderful mother. She adored those boys. And never let them forget it. Always warm.
CHARLES	Never afraid to show her feelings.
ELIZABETH	Especially whenever a photographer was in sight.
CHARLES	Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that, but still..
CHARLES (cont'd)	That was always the extraordinary thing about her. Her weaknesses and transgressions only seemed to make the public love her MORE. Yet ours only make them hate us. Why is that? Why do they hate us so much?
ELIZABETH	Not `us', dear.
CHARLES	What?
CHARLES	Yesterday, when we drove the coffin back into London, there was a noise. A bang. I don't mind telling you I thought it was a gun.
CHARLES (cont'd)	I thought someone had taken a shot at me.
ELIZABETH	Why don't you go on without me? I'm going to walk back..
CHARLES	Are you sure?
ELIZABETH	Yes. It looks like rain.. And I'm not in the mood for stalking anyway.
ELIZABETH	Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You don't want me to trip and hurt myself, do you? You wouldn't get any proper walks then.
ELIZABETH	Right. Done. Now who knows the way home?
ELIZABETH	You clever things!
ELIZABETH	I spoke to Charles this afternoon.
ELIZABETH	Who was good enough to share with me his views on motherhood.
PRINCE PHILIP	What did he say? A TV plays in the corner. DIANA, starved thin, panda-eyes,
ELIZABETH	How wonderful Diana was.
RINCE PHILIP	That's changing his tune.
ELIZABETH	What a natural.
IANA (ON TV)	..I think..they see me as a threat of some kind..
PRINCE PHILIP	Oh, for God's sake..
ELIZABETH	Maybe he's got a point. Maybe we are partly to blame.
PRINCE PHILIP	I can't watch this.
ELIZABETH	No, wait. Leave it.
DIANA (ON TV)	"Every strong woman in history has had to walk down a similar path.."
ELIZABETH	We encouraged the match. And signed off on it. Both of us. You were very enthusiastic, remember.
RINCE PHILIP	She was a nice girl. Then. "And I think it's this strength that causes the confusion and the fear."
PRINCE PHILIP	And I was sure he'd give the other one up. Or, at least make sure his wife towed the line. Isn't that what everyone does?
ELIZABETH	Is it?
DIANA (ON TV)	"Why is she strong? Where is she getting it from? Where is she going to take it? How is she going to use it?" I can't bear it any more. If you're watching, I'll sleep in here. Early start tomorrow.. See you in the morning.
CHERIE (cont'd)	How much of all this could be the first stirrings of..
TONY	W hat?
HERIE	..I don't know...something more interesting. Maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they are.
TONY	Which is?
CHERIE	A bunch of freeloading, emotionally retarded...nutters.
TONY	That's just absurd.
CHERIE	Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth. They don't pay tax.
TONY	Yes, they do.
CHERIE	The Queen alone costs us what? Thirty, forty million a year..
TONY	ot you, too. Look...if you want to have a serious conversation about this..
CHERIE	I do..
TONY	..about the Constitution..
CHERIE	e don't HAVE one..
TONY	...or about ways in which we as a Government could begin to phase out hereditary privileges, then fine.
HERIE	If you're going, take the dishes..
TONY	But spare me the whole.."off with their heads" thing.
CHERIE	Why?
TONY	Because it insults your intelligence.
CHERIE	"The case for reform is simple and obvious. It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth, not merit or election." YOUR words, not mine.
TONY	Well, maybe now I've grown up. It's unimaginable this country being a republic. Certainly in her lifetime.
CHERIE	Why?
TONY	Because...no would would wear it. No one WANTS it. It's just...daft.
HERIE	It's not a mother thing, is it?
CHERIE	Think about it. If she were still alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the same age? Whenever you talk about your mother, you mention her stoicism. Her frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact she was brought up in the way. Well c'mon..? Who does THAT sound like?
TONY	I'm going to do the washing-up. F ADE TO BLACK
ALASTAIR	All right, the good news is that the Palace has agreed to video screens in the Royal Parks.
TONY	And the bad news?
ALASTAIR	Crash barriers.
TONY	What about them?
ALASTAIR	hey're now predicting more than two million people will descend on London, and there aren't enough barriers to line the route. So we've gone cap in hand to the French for theirs. And there's something else I think you should see.
T	TONY follows ALASTAIR into an office where a television plays
ALASTAIR	Can we run that piece again? You're going to love this.
TONY	Look, I know all this..
ALASTAIR	There!
TONY	Don't tell me. There isn't a flag flying at half mast above Buckingham Palace.
TONY	God. Will someone save these people from themselves.. F ine. I'll call Balmoral...
ALASTAIR	`Planet Zog'?
TONY	Because as Prime Minister of this country, I've really got nothing better to do.. LAND ROVER pulls up. The QUEEN gets out with her dogs. She
ELIZABETH	Those fire-lighters no good? I brought some stew just in case. I think it's lamb. We could always have that cold..
PRINCE PHILIP	No, we'll be all right.
ELIZABETH	Robin had a call from the Prime Minister. Who expressed his concern.
PRINCE PHILIP	About WHAT?
ELIZABETH	The flag above Buckingham Palace. He thinks it should be flying at half- mast. whimper hungrily.
RINCE PHILIP	Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T a flag above Buckingham Palace... ...only the Royal Standard, which flies for one reason only. To denote the presence of the Monarch. Since you're here, the flag pole is bare. Which is as it should be.
CHARLES	Isn't it possible..that to some people...the Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag? And that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal.
ELIZABETH	That's not the point.
RINCE PHILIP	The point is it's more than four hundred years old. It has never been lowered for ANYONE..
QUEEN MOTHER	Your grandfather didn't get that flag at half-mast when he died and if your mother were to die tomorrow, she wouldn't get it either.
CHARLES	Yes...but sometimes...in a situation like this..one has to be flexible..
CHARLES	It is just a flag.
ELIZABETH	"What about the Union Jack?", was Mr. Blair's next suggestion.
UEEN MOTHER	Oh, for heaven's sake.
PRINCE PHILIP	The next thing he'll be suggesting you change your name to Hilda and mine to Hector? Who does he think he's talking to? You're the Sovereign. The Head of State. You don't get dictated to. You've conceded the idea of a public funeral. You've opened up the parks. That's ENOUGH.
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)	You wait. In forty-eight hours it was all have calmed down.
ELIZABETH	Like those condolence books.
PRINCE PHILIP	Quite right. When we started with one, everyone predicted they would grow and grow. But we've heard nothing more about that, see?
CHARLES	Apparently there are now fifteen.
ELIZABETH	What..?
CHARLES	And people are queuing through the night.
HARLES	In one sense its comforting. For the first time my parents can see what it's been like for me all these years, being up against her popularity. But they're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her, will eventually be the one seen by the public. But it's not. The two Dianas, theirs and ours, bear no relation to one another at all. They just adored her. Would have loved nothing more than for her to be Queen. Someone compassionate. With a heart. Gifts in tragically short supply around here.
CHARLES	I've been thinking is the flag flying at half mast over my house at Highgrove?
LAMPORT	Yes, Sir.
CHARLES	Make sure we get a picture of that in the papers, would you? If my mother wants to make a mess of this, that's her business. I won't let her drag me down, too.
C	Tony Blair in London. TONY and CHERIE watch..
HERIE	See? It isn't just me.
TONY	What?
CHERIE	People really DO want change. And want YOU to give it to them.
TONY	And do what? Cut off their heads?
HERIE	Apparently, one in six people now support the idea of getting rid of the Monarchy.
TONY	That's just the papers spoiling for a fight.
CHERIE	But still, imagine this country without them? With a nice elected Head of State? That'd be some legacy. If the revolution were to happen on your watch.
ANVRIN	That's the stalking party off?
JANVRIN	Right, we'd better have a look at these papers. S
ECRETARY	"Show us there's a heart in the House of Windsor," says the Sun..
SECRETARY	It proves, the Royals are not like us", the Mirror. "Time to change the Old Guard at Buckingham Palace". Express.
JANVRIN	God.. The SECRETARY reads from "THE INDEPENDENT" ..
SECRETARY	"One can't help wondering who's advice they are taking for it's clearly the wrong advice..."
JANVRIN	Right...
JANVRIN (cont'd)	Well, I'll try not to take that personally.
TONY	"People have been yearning for a change in this country." Good. "The result is a quiet revolution now taking place. Led by the real modernisers. The British People.." T TONY tails off..
TONY	Who wrote this?
TONY	Where does it come from?
AIDE	Where does it come from?
IDE 2	Just look at the papers. Talk to people on the streets.
IDE	Something's happening out there.
TONY	Revolution.
TONY (cont'd)	Get me Balmoral, will you? I'll take it in my office.
TONY	Right. You lot. Out.
AIDE	What about the speech?
TONY	Later. J ANVRIN ..and finally, Ma'am, a DSO medal. A Corporal, in Kosovo..you may have read about it in the papers..pulled two civilians from a bus after a bomb blast.
PRINCE PHILIP	Hurry up, dear. Getting cold. Is that it?
JANVRIN	Yes, Ma'am. Just the letter of condolence to the widow of the Ambassador to Brazil.
ELIZABETH	Good.
JANVRIN	Ma'am, apparently the Prime Minister is on the phone for you.
RINCE PHILIP	Tell him to call back.
ELIZABETH	No, I'd better take it.
ELIZABETH	Prime Minister?
TONY	Good afternoon, your Majesty. I'm sorry to disturb. I was just wondering..
TONY	...whether you'd seen any of today's papers?
ELIZABETH	We've managed to look at one or two, yes.
TONY	In which case, my next question would be - whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary?
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	No. I believe a few over-eager editors are doing their best to sell newspapers..and it would be a mistake to dance to their tune.
TONY	Under normal circumstances I would agree, but..P RINCE PHILIP Here we go! The bloody flag again..!
TONY	..my advisers have been taking the temperature among people on the streets - and the information I'm getting is that the mood.. ...is quite delicate.
PRINCE PHILIP	Of course. That's where all the ruddy cameras are.
ELIZABETH	So what would you suggest, Prime Minister? Some kind of statement?
TONY	No, Ma'am. I believe the moment for statements has passed.
TONY	I would suggest flying the flag at half-mast above Buckingham Palace...
PRINCE PHILIP	See!
TONY	And coming down to London at the earliest opportunity.
TONY	It would be a great comfort to your people and would help them with their grief.
ELIZABETH	THEIR grief?
ELIZABETH	If you're suggesting that I drop everything and come down to London before I attend to two boys that have just lost their mother..you're mistaken.
RINCE PHILIP	Absurd.. E
ELIZABETH	I doubt there are many who know the British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement. And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press...in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning. That's the way we do things in this country. Quietly. With dignity. It's what the rest of the world has always admired us for.
TONY	Well, if that's your decision, Ma'am, of course the government will support it. Let's keep in touch.
ELIZABETH	Yes. could hardly be less Let's.
PRINCE PHILIP	Bloody fool.
PRINCE PHILIP	Now your tea's gone cold.
T	TONY hangs up the phone. He is lost in thought. His SECRETARY
SECRETARY	Robin Janvrin on one. He must have been listening in.
TONY	Mr Janvrin?
JANVRIN	Prime Minister, I understand how `difficult' her behaviour must seem to you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see it from her perspective.. She's been brought up to believe its God's will that she is who she is.
TONY	I think we should leave God out of it. It's just not helpful.
JANVRIN	She won't have seen anything like this since the Abdication. And I cannot emphasise enough what affect that had on her. Unexpectedly becoming King as good as killed her father.
TONY	All right - but first we have to deal with these terrible headlines. I'll see what I can do with the Press.
JANVRIN	I'm most grateful, Prime Minister.
TONY	But I can't promise anything. It's not me they want to see.
TONY	Ask Alistair to come and see me will you.
TONY	nd cancel whatever I'm doing tonight.
ELIZABETH	Oh..
ELIZABETH	Oh, you are stupid.
ELIZABETH	Hello? Could you put me through to the Ghillies' office? H ello, Thomas? I'm afraid I've done something very foolish. I think I've broken the prop-shaft. Crossing the river.
HEAD GHILLIE	Are you sure, Ma'am?
ELIZABETH	Yes, perfectly. The front one, not the rear. I've lost the four-wheel drive. You forget I worked as a mechanic in the war.
HEAD GHILLIE	And are you all right?
ELIZABETH	Yes, perfectly, thank you. I'm so sorry to waste your time..
HEAD GHILIE	We'll come out straightaway.
ELIZABETH	Oh, will you? You are kind. Thank you. I'll wait by the car. Privacy at last. The first moment of silence in what feels
W	e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket
ELIZABETH	Oh, you are a beauty. It's a magical moment. All around them the whistling of wind,
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	Go. Go on. You'd better go.. Go. Shoo. Go on.
CHERIE	I've just been told there are news crews outside waiting for you to come and "speak to the people."
TONY	Yes.
HERIE	What's that about?
TONY	I told the Queen's private secretary I'd do what I could to help with the press. Why? Don't you think she deserves it? Sitting up there on her 40,000 acres.
TONY	I know...but allowing her to hang herself might not be in our best interests either.
TONY	Besides, I think there's something...ugly about the way everyone's started to bully her. he QUEEN is in bed, watching television. Staring.
V PRESENTER	..earlier tonight the Prime Minister went out and pleaded with people to understand the Royals' behaviour..
ELIZABETH	How are the boys?
PRINCE PHILIP	Not so good tonight. A lot of slamming doors. I think they saw the papers.
ELIZABETH	Oh, no..
PRINCE PHILIP	I'll take them out early again tomorrow morning.
TV INTERVIEWER (ON TV)	Where have you come from?
MOURNER 1 (ON TV)	Hamburg.
TV INTERVIEWER (ON TV)	Hamburg, Germany?
OURNER 1 (ON TV)	Well, I just had to be here. She was such a wonderful woman.. P RINCE PHILIP What?
MOURNER 2 (ON TV)	She was an angel..
PRINCE PHILIP	...and a hysteric.
MOURNER 3 (ON TV)	o compassionate, and caring..
PRINCE PHILIP	Oh, please..
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)	Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew?
PRINCE PHILIP	And they think we're mad?
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)	Have you seen the latest funeral guest list?
ELIZABETH	No.
PRINCE PHILIP	I suggest you keep it that way. A chorus line of soap stars and homosexuals. Apparently Elton John is going to be singing.
PRINCE PHILIP	That'll be a first for Westminster Abbey.
PRINCE PHILIP	Condolence books are now being signed in our embassies in every major city And in London alone the number has reached forty.
PRINCE PHILIP	stares at the CROWDS of This reminds me of one of those films. A few of us in a Fort. Hordes of Zulus outside.
P	silence. The TELEVISION coverage continues..
RINCE PHILIP	So it's VITAL you hold firm. Stick to your guns. You wait. They will come to their senses soon. They HAVE to.
PRINCE PHILIP	C'mon, move over, Cabbage. ELEVISION PRESENTER It's six o'clock. Time for a look at the morning's newspapers. Jenny..
JENNY	Good morning. Well if you thought yesterday's headlines for the Royals couldn't get any worse - think again.
ALASTAIR	T he Sun - "Where is our Queen? Where is her flag?" The Express, "Show us you care", with a picture of a grumpy Queen. The Mail - "Let the Flag Fly at half- mast", and inside, "The Queen should be here to show her respects."
LASTAIR	Blimey! But the flip-side is... "Blair more popular than Churchill shock."
TONY	Did any of them pick up on our statement of support?
ALASTAIR	Just one.
LASTAIR (cont'd)	Statements of support don't sell papers.
TONY	Right..
ANVRIN	The Prime Minister for you, Ma'am.
JANVRIN	I'm afraid he's rather insisting.
ELIZABETH	All right. I'll take it here. In the kitchens.
ELIZABETH	ood morning, Prime Minister. T TONY Good morning, Ma'am. You've seen today's headlines?
ELIZABETH	Yes, I have.
TONY	Then I'm sure you'll agree. The situation has become quite critical.
TONY (CONT'D)	Ma'am, a poll that's to be published in tomorrow's paper suggests 70% of people believe your actions have damaged the monarchy and one in four are now in favour of abolishing the monarchy altogether.
TONY	As your Prime Minister, I believe it's my constitutional responsibility to ADVISE the following..
ELIZABETH	Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?
ELIZABETH	Mummy?
ELIZABETH	One - lower the flag to half-mast above Buckingham Palace and all other Royal residences. Two - leave Balmoral, and fly down to London at the earliest opportunity. Three - pay respects in person at Diana's coffin. And four - make a statement via live television to my people and the world.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	Swift prosecution of these matters, he felt, might, just might avert disaster. E
QUEEN MOTHER	bviously you're going to have to talk to the Lord Chamberlain about all this.
ELIZABETH	I have.
UEEN MOTHER	And to Robert Fellowes.
ELIZABETH	To him too.
UEEN MOTHER	And..? It seems they both agree with him.
QUEEN MOTHER	I see.
ELIZABETH	Something's happened. There's been a change...a shift of values.. When you no longer understand your people, isn't it time to hand over to the next generation?
QUEEN MOTHER	Certainly not! Remember the oath you took
ELIZABETH	"I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service."
QUEEN MOTHER	Your WHOLE life. That's a commitment to God as well as your people.
ELIZABETH	But if my actions are damaging the crown?
QUEEN MOTHER	Damaging them? My dear, you are the greatest asset this institution has. One of the greatest it has EVER had. The problem will come when you leave, but that's not for you to worry about - and certainly not today.
ELIZABETH	Mummy.. Then drifts off, into her own thoughts
ELIZABETH	It's just no one seems to value tradition or constancy any more. It's all about show. About wearing your heart on your sleeve.
QUEEN MOTHER	And you're not like that. Never have been. No...you must show strength. Re- assert your authority. You sit on the most powerful throne in Europe. Head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years. How many of your predecessors do you imagine would have dropped everything and gone down to London because people holding candles wanted help with their grief?
UEEN MOTHER	And as for Mr Blair and his Cheshire Cat grin...
GHILLIE	Mr Janvrin for you sir.
PRINCE PHILIP	Yes Robin....?
PRINCE PHILIP	What? It's madness! The whole thing! Bloody madness!
PRINCE PHILIP	It seems we are going back to London!
CHARLES	I've just been told. You've decided to go back to London.
T	he QUEEN's face. Avoids eye contact.
CHARLES	I just want to say - I admire... I think it's the right decision.
CHARLES	Let's hope we haven't left it too late. BANG' a passing motorbike's exhaust backfires. CHARLES jolts Clearly, his fears have not lessened. He's expecting the
NEWS READER (ON T.V.)	We are just getting some pictures now from Balmoral. These are rather historic shots. Clearly the Queen has responded to criticism that the Royal Family is not engaged..
T	TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief..
TONY	Thank God for that. It's fish-fingers. Want any?
TONY	Be right there.
CHERIE	I'm afraid they're a bit burned.
P	RINCE PHILIP Where are the boys? Have they already left?
ELIZABETH	Yes. They left for London after breakfast. With Charles.
PRINCE PHILIP	It's not right, you know
ELIZABETH	Yes, but further discussion is no longer helpful either.
PRINCE PHILIP	Oh, well. I suppose it gives the ghillies time to find a new stag for the boys now theirs has been shot.
ELIZABETH	What?
PRINCE PHILIP	Haven't you heard? It wandered onto one of the neighbouring estates where it was shot by one of the commercial guests.
ELIZABETH	Really..? Which estate?
CAMPBELL	Here's your box. There's some And you've seen the papers?
TONY	I'm the Prime Minister. Of course I've seen the papers.
LASTAIR	"Your Maj? Come down to London." "Who says so?" "Tony Blair."
ALASTAIR	"Mr. Father of the Nation."
HEAD GILLIE	Morning, Ma'am. Is it his Lordship you've come to see? H e reaches into his pockets for his cell-phone..
ELIZABETH	No, no..please don't disturb him. I've come on another matter. I hope you don't mind..
HEAD GILLIE	There he is.. Yes, he's a beauty, isn't he? An Imperial, Ma'am. Fourteen pointer.
ELIZABETH	e was wounded.
HEAD GILLIE	Yes. We got our guest in very close, had him lined-up perfect, and still.. ..an investment banker, Ma'am. From London.
HEAD GILLIE (cont'd)	I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow him for miles - to finish him off.
ELIZABETH	Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	Please pass my congratulations to your guest.
HEAD GILLIE	I will, Ma'am.
HEAD GILLIE	God bless you. ELIZABETH Yes, Robin..
JANVRIN	I've done a draft of your television address.
ELIZABETH	Thank you.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	Was there anything else?
JANVRIN	No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.
SECRETARY	I've got a copy of the Queen's speech.
SECRETARY	Shall I give Tony a copy?
LASTAIR	Let me have a look at it first.
PRINCE PHILIP	Good God..
ALASTAIR	They sent a copy of the Queen's speech. You might want to scrape the frost off it first.
ALASTAIR	I made a couple of changes. So it sounds like it comes from a human being.
ALASTAIR	Oh, and one bit of good news. The old boot's FINALLY agreed to pay respects at Diana's coffin.
TONY	You know when you get it wrong, you REALLY get it wrong. That woman has given her whole life in service to her people - fifty years doing a job she NEVER wanted - a job she watched kill her father. She's executed it with dignity, honour and, as far as I can tell, without a single blemish - and now we line up baying for her blood - why? Because she's struggling to lead the world in mourning for a woman who threw everything she offered back in her face, and who seemed, in the last few years, to be committed twenty-four seven to destroy everything she holds dear.
ELIZABETH	Oh..hello. Would you like me to place them for you?
LITTLE GIRL	No.
ELIZABETH	Oh.
LITTLE GIRL	They're for you.
ELIZABETH	For me..?
C	ROWDS of MOURNERS watch intently. The QUEEN takes the
ANVRIN	Your Majesty, there's a last minute addition from Downing Street. They're suggesting adding `..and as a grandmother..' here.
ELIZABETH	Right. "So what I say to you now, as your Queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart."
JANVRIN	You think you can say it?
ELIZABETH	Do I have a choice?
IRECTOR	We're ready for you, your Majesty..
DIRECTOR	Just to confirm this is going out live.
ELIZABETH	Right
DIRECTOR	And you'll be at the front of the six o'clock news on all the channels
ELIZABETH	I see.
FLOOR MANAGER	Ten seconds, everyone..
DIRECTOR (cont'd)	Five, four..
ELIZABETH	Since last Saturday's dreadful news we have seen, throughout Britain and the world, an overwhelming expression of sadness at Diana's death.. I
ELIZABETH	We have all been trying in our different ways to cope. The initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings. Disbelief, incomprehension, anger and concern for those who remain.
ELIZABETH (ON TV)	We have all felt these emotions in these last few days. So what I say to you now, as your Queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart...
CHERIE	"Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't mean a word of this.
TONY	That's not the point. What she's doing is extraordinary. That's how you survive.
CHERIE	Listen to you! A week ago you were the great moderniser, making speeches about the "People's Princess", now you've gone weak at the knees.
CHERIE	I don't know why I'm surprised. In the end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga- ga for her Maj. I hope that tomorrow we can all, wherever we are, join in expressing our grief at Diana's loss, and gratitude for her all-too-short life.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	May those who died rest in peace and may we, each and every one of us.. ..thank God for someone who made many, many people happy.
DIRECTOR	And we're out..! D Thank you, your Majesty. T he entire distraught, tearful NATION it seems, has come out
CHERIE	So? Off to see your girlfriend?
TONY	Now, now..
CHERIE	I hope she shows you some respect this time. It's quite a debt of gratitude she owes you.
CHERIE	Mr "Saviour of the Monarchy."
TONY	doubt she'll see it that way.
TONY	Robin. Good to see you.
JANVRIN	Prime Minister.
TONY	Tony, please..
EQUERRY	The Prime Minister, Ma'am.
ELIZABETH	Do sit down.
TONY	Thank you. TONY It's good to see you again. After quite a summer..
TONY (cont'd)	I'm referring to your visit to India and Pakistan, where your comments about ending historic disagreements went down very well. And the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi, who was saying how much he appreciated your tough stance on Nigeria. Silence.
TONY	I meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather.
TONY	I imagine those occasions are quite difficult. Twenty-four heads of Government each clamouring for a private audience..
TONY	Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week. And I wanted to offer my apologies..
ELIZABETH	Whatever for?
TONY	In case you'd felt `manhandled' or `managed' in any way.
ELIZABETH	Not at all.
ELIZABETH	I don't think I shall ever understand what happened this summer.
TONY	The circumstances were exceptional, Ma'am. And in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility. E
ELIZABETH	ou're confusing humility with humiliation.
TONY	That's not true.
ELIZABETH	You didn't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday.
TONY	I still believe History will show it was a good week for you.
ELIZABETH	And an even better one for you, Mr Blair.
TONY	But there are fifty-two weeks in a year, Ma'am. And two and a half thousand in a half century.
TONY	And when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days.
ELIZABETH	Really?
ELIZABETH	You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for..
ELIZABETH	..this institution has been diminished?
TONY	Not at all.
ELIZABETH	I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support..
TONY	One or two. But as a leader one has...a different perspective. I could never have added my voice to the chorus.
ELIZABETH	You're very kind.
ELIZABETH	But let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason.
TONY	Which is?
ELIZABETH	That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has.
ELIZABETH	If fifty years of doing MY job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. Just look at the French. I suppose we'd better get on with the business in hand.. I do love this time of day. Shall we walk while there's still some sunshine left? I do hope you're a walker.
TONY	I am.
ELIZABETH	Good. The clocks go back next week, then it'll be dark by five.
ELIZABETH (cont'd)	I always think these meetings stand a better chance of succeeding if the Prime Minister is a walker.
ELIZABETH	As a matter of fact, it's how I think best. On my feet. I've never been one for sitting around endlessly. A good walk and fresh air sorts everything out..
ELIZABETH	One in four, you said? Wanted to get rid of me? T
TONY	For about half an hour. But then you came down to London and all that went away.
ELIZABETH	I've never been hated like that before.
TONY	No. And that must have been difficult.
ELIZABETH	It was. Very.
ELIZABETH	Ever since Diana people want glamour and tears..the grand performance..and I'm not very good at that. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly I believed that's what people wanted from their Queen. Not to make a fuss nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve, duty first... self second.
ELIZABETH	It's how I was brought up. It's all I've ever known
TONY	One forgets. You were so young when you became Queen. The QUEEN drifts off..
ELIZABETH	I was. A girl.
ELIZABETH	But I can see the world has changed. And one must 'modernise'.
TONY	Well, perhaps that's where I can help.
ELIZABETH	Don't get ahead of yourself Prime- minister, I think you'll find that I'm supposed to be advising YOU!
ELIZABETH	So...what might we expect in your first Parliament?
TONY	Well, Ma'am, top of the list is education reform. We want to radically reduce classroom sizes...
The momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long
