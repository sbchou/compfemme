	know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give
	doesn't look good.
	then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going
	I wish he would let me settle it on my own.
	kill him!
	fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
	all the fuss about Harry? Why don't we just boycott the payment?
	me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on
	think of something, don't worry.
	the hell's that. It's only twelve.
	that cage, that's what it's there for.
	is it?
	open up.
	do you think?
	me!
	God's sake.
	that up, Charles.
	you, you clean it up.
	fellas, but that stupid cow!
	mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way.
	how much do you want?
	
	one and a half thousand. Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out
	odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
	would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
	the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
	hit us all hard!
	but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
	to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's
	how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
	no longer than four weeks.
	month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six
	it's still a good idea.
	to this one . . .
	do you know these geezers well?
	enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of
	they like then?
	Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
	you keep all the money'
	have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes
	ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day, talking bollocks.
	you're so fucking clever why don't you come up with a suggestion?
	am thinking, I am thinking.
	they can't be all stupid if they got a container load of cash
	one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
	do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
	must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not
	there no way they can get back to you?
	if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle;
	be here any minute. I think you're making a mistake, Harry.
	do you know about Chris, eh? You put Big Chris on a job and he
	son, would you like a lolly?
	it? One of a pair, Holland and Holland. Here, you want to hold it? Soap are sitting in front of Ed who looks as though he is about to
	the flapping about? You told the old man yet? EDDY
	might think we smoke a lot and burn a bit of profit, but he can't
	guys, you've got to realise who this chap is. He's a fucking
	
	
	
	Daisy.
	know who it is. What's the problem?
	what do you want us to do about it?
	the fuckers.
	don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
	can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can
	heavy are the fellas anyway?
	right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the
	we hit them as soon as they come back. We'll be waiting and
	was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
	bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do
	You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . .
	Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
	we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
	them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
	just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume
	you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the
	the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
	excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any
	normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think
	sound very good to me.
	me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's
	it's all completely chicken soup.
	don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
	mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of
	hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon'
	think you're Nick the Greek.
	I don't have anything to do with weed, normally, but if it is
	your hair supposed to look like that, then?
	time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are
	the others?
	are no others.
	stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
	don't know what you mean.
	were two old guns there; where are they?
	in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock
	you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
	were . . .
	am not fucking interested.
	if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you
	got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself
	look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility,
	hundred each.
	that, a pound for every year they have been around? I know
	are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
	I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but
	course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
	right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your
	Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy
	understand if this has come as a bit of a shock, but I'll tell you
	on.
	like your bar.
	
	want your bar.
	
	you want me to draw a picture?
	that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you
	and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of
	you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But
	careful JD, you'll give Barry a heart-attack.
	nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
	is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this
	that idiot doing next door? use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out
	
	it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the

	the Greek.
	much did you part with?
	hundred for the pair.
	I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They
	Tom, do they work?
	dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
	of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
	if you don't mind, back to a more important issue. We've only
	there something we should know about you, Soap?
	am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
	the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a
