CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
By	Dean Georgaris Based on the novel by Richard Condon and the screenplay by George Axelrod Daniel Pyne, August 18, 2003
Approximately sixty four hundred hours	before Desert Storm, we were on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing troop strength for what Saddam Hussein promised to be the mother of all wars ... but turned out to be just a little warm up for the whomping he got a few years later. ... this way --? road less travelled.

The men don't care for me very much. you don't really like them, either. Marco follows Laurent's gaze out the side window -- hardware rat-fucked by a coupla used Toyotas.

Marco nods toward it. ANOTHER SCOUT concussion -- lost focus -- Sgt. Shaw took command -- A disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily, as:
The Medal of Honor is the highest award	to which any soldier can aspire. From the jungles of Iwo Jima to the desert of Kuwait, what these brave men I've talked about today did will never be forgotten. Since 1917, only 827 medals have been given to a total of more than 30 million Americans in arms. Only three have been awarded in the last 40 years. Who knows? Maybe someday one of you fine boys will earn one yourself in defense of this great nation. A SCOUTMASTER, thin, bearded, stands up: 488 -- just like to thank you, for coming to talk to us, about the Medal of Honor, and your interesting experiences in the Armed Services. MARCO claimed the Army as a trade ever since a young gunnery officer who grew up with Hernando De Soto left Spain for a look at the upper Mississippi. My life is in service to my country. Something causes Marco to hesitate. Then, as if he'd rehearsed it: He sits down. Spattering of polite applause.
Major Marco.	Marco turns, stares blankly into the eyes of the bedraggled- From your unit. Desert Storm. Marco stares hard. Melvin looks like a homeless guy, his I have these dreams, Major. MELVIN Baker. Raymond Shaw. See, I remember it happened the way you just said. And then I don't.
Well, we had a pretty rough time over	there, Al, it was hairy, and -- it was a long time ago, now. Memories shift. Marco stares at him. face falls, disappointed. Fumbling in his clothes, write it down, every night, after I wake up, I try to get it all -- it doesn't always go together -- all of what I can remember, and -- -- Al, you know, maybe you should be going to the VA and talking to a doctor, I mean if these dreams are really -- notebook DROPS BETWEEN THEM, and PAGES SCATTER on the Shaw saving us, but it does not make sense -- it should have been you.

None of these involve slave traders or	sheiks, Abby. I checked. What do I owe you? A smile. She does.
yellowing newspaper clippings and wire photographs of	events of Bloody Friday, with the war on terror marching into yet another year, no end in sight -- new agenda -- but because this party remains deeply divided on so many issues, the choice of a vice presidential nominee may be the key unifying factor for the delegates of this convention in much the way Johnson helped Kennedy in 1960 ... Then he's up on his feet, moving to the kitchen through the own house -- the danger to our country is not from some terrorists at large -- terrorists we've helped engender with twenty years of failed foreign policy -- An open cabinet door behind Marco reveals ROWS AND ROWS OF civil liberties, gutting the Bill of Rights, allowing our fear to destroy our democratic ideals -- ...

KNOCKING on his door -- it opens, and Secret Service AGENT do, make me stand out there like room service? -- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone -- 'wrangler' -- helpful Ms. Freeman -- said you were up here practicing your speech. Honestly, I don't understand why you insist upon isolating yourself, people adore you, Raymond, they crave your company and yet here you are, holed up, as if you were some kind of emotionally challenged individual like your father instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw, a handsome, intelligent, people-loving war hero with a great deal to offer to his party and his country. a question. Your hair is too flat. And that tie. The tie is wrong. RAYMOND No to all the questions you pretend to want to ask -- Something a little less busy. usual back-door political thuggery to shovel me onto the presidential ticket. you were. Did I miss my cue? here if I wasn't -- but not if it means attacking the reputation of a statesman like Thomas Jordan, which I'm sure was your plan. Let democracy run its course, mother. Let the people decide. Ellie stares at him, mouth agape. it was your father speaking -- that dreaded Shaw blood rising -- and the stink of defeat made me nauseous. the honorable Mr. Jordan, despite the shameful way his daughter misled you that summer at the shore. ELLIE somewhat -- but, yes, okay -- I promise, promise I will stay out of it. You have my word. Raymond stares at her. plenty of party conventions ahead of you in which to discover, as your father did, that democracy is an elusive and imperfect science, and the meek do not happily inherit the earth, but simply get eaten by the alpha dogs, chewed up, digested and deposited on the carefully mown parkways of American politics. Raymond rolls his eyes. She ruffles his hair again, heads
One day, you will, I'm sure, tearfully	memorialize me in your acceptance speech. Don't you have a different tie in here? Your grandfather always let me pick his ties. Raymond smooths his hair back down. No response. politician, although I hold, and have been held -- well, hugged -- in elected office -- -- you all know my mother, Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw ... A CHORUS of cheers, and appreciative laughter -- he's won father ... the late Senator John Shaw. I've been honored to serve my two terms in Congress. But I also grew up on the Hill. I've seen how the game is played by professionals -- Marco reaches for his steaming cup of coffee, his eyes never bullied, agendas bought and sold -- and, with apologies to my mother, I wish to remain an amateur. I believe democracy is not negotiable. We need to secure tomorrow, today. Ellie shakes her head fondly, and begins to move away as Raymond's speech echoes incoherently through the corridor.
They should be down on their fat white	knees thanking me for saving this party from committing political seppuku. CONGRESSMAN HEALY
You gave them every opportunity to do the	right thing, Senator. No. I gave them one opportunity. And that was unusually generous of me. She pushes through a door, and into -- Jordan is on the ticket. We don't need your blessing, but we'd like it. Before we get started, I'm dying to know: which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a Sound Bite from Nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers off our busses is unconstitutional? Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American public and --
'Sits quite well' translates into how	many votes?
Your son is largely unknown outside of	New York. His public service, his Congressional record, while commendable, is -- Governor Arthur has agreed to consider Raymond for a cabinet post. A cold silence. Ellie stands -- ELLIE Did we come here to have a discussion? this, or even push the nomination to a second ballot. Even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad, Arthur is still unelectable without help. Consider. The Governor is a corn-belt candidate who -- scratch and sniff -- looks and smells alot like the kind of liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was, but without, thank God, the helmet. Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the Northeast, plus his home ground, and California. We're still dead in the South, and Southwest, where they win by landslides. The mid-central is a toss- up. Tom Jordan actually becomes a liability in Florida because of his Castro-appeasement profile, and in the Carolinas, where he fumbles the military vote over his "terrorism isn't a war it's a social disease" nonsense. room is surreally silent. Ellie spins and moves like a surveys back me up. You're counting on Jordan to help you get the black vote, women, college kids -- my gut instinct says he won't -- and Arthur holding the center -- where he's soft at best. And who's to say the President won't throw troops into another third- world skirmish, pushing his sidekick's approval ratings up into the eighties again, and the campaign off the front pages? UTLY Ellie. points? Three? I can swing that, and you know it. I can swing seven away from you -- more than enough to split the party and -- -- and deny us the White House for four more years? No. Not even you would do that, Senator. You're bluffing. Ellie stares at them. OUTSIDE, SUDDENLY: the marching band its history, gentlemen. Not just from terrorist organizations both outside and within our borders, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the only way to protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we get around to them. Am I the only one in this room paying attention to the NSA reports? We are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on our own soil, while our policies remain shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders who insist that human beings are essentially Good ... and that Power is something shameful, and Evil. Make no mistake, the people of this great country are frightened. They know what's coming. They can feel it. And we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar, or arm them, with a young, vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in the desert, in the dark, when American lives hung in the balance. name of the next vice president of these United States, RAYMOND SHAAAWWWWWW --!

SNAPPING of fabric, the wind gets louder.
Our Candidate's course of treatment will,	of course, involve considerably more sophisticated intervention over a sustained time period, to ensure that a stable mechanism is irrevocably in place. We employ a kind of neurocellular conversion. Psychological abreaction through genomic repurposing.

Made worse by your chronic fear of them. Add in all the recent campaign news about Congressman Shaw, which is obviously rekindling your feelings of guilt and jealousy -- the news from the convention? Marco shrugs. LT. COL. HOWARD
Yes.	Glad for him. He deserves it. Raymond Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest, warmest -- a beat -- says nothing. Holding back what he's thinking.

You're not nuts, there's some crazy shit going down here." Marco says nothing. before, yes? what you're saying, and I want to do this through the proper channels. I've had a dozen years of experts telling me I've got Gulf War Syndrome, or a stress disorder. Twelve years being a good soldier, denying what every nerve ending in my body tells me is more real than not. One dream, over and over. Not variations on a dream, the same one, night after night after night --

Have you contacted any other members of	the unit besides Shaw and Melvin? Asked them about the dreams? Owens died of cancer in '97. Villalobos, a car crash. Atkins committed suicide. Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11, body never recovered. Wilson I'm still trying to track down. and Howard trade looks. Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin, it's a phone call, a quick q&a; -- look at his notebooks, hear what he's been dreaming -- and either he will support the credibility of what I'm saying, or he won't. And I'll shut up. Major? That you misrepresented -- falsified -- what happened In Kuwait? About the Medal of Honor? In effect, committed perjury. -- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And somehow you're the only one who knows the truth. Marco looks down at his hands. COLONEL GARRET Congressman Shaw. That is an order. Beat. Marco stands up, to leave, but --
Major, do you ever take a step back and	consider why you've remained at rank for all these years? Missed Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom. While men of lesser promise and inferior talent have enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and moved beyond you? Sierra Leone, new terrorist alliances forming in many parts of Asia and South America -- we can't simply, suddenly relinquish our commitment to world leaders who have stood by us. Hello, Victor?

Holding, Marco studies the image of Raymond. in a small American town, is standing in her kitchen -- she's got her medicine bottle in one hand, she's opening the refrigerator with the other. And she's thinking: I can pay for my medicine, or I can pay for my dinner. I can't do both. In America. In America, our mothers and grandmothers shouldn't have to worry about that.

I thought you were magnificent tonight. So do all the network campaign experts. "Presidential" was a word they used. Raymond's second line flashes with another call.
This compassionate vigilance thing is	working quite well for you. I might have to convert. Raymond punches a button and puts his mother on HOLD. Sergeant Shaw? Who is this? on RAYMOND'S EAR --

"The recon ends without incident, and we are heading back to forward command..." ... we're heading back to forward command. The night is clear.

MARCO has known Marco too long, and too well, not to take him implantable I.D. thing -- you could imbed it under the skin, then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information, blood-type, DNA. Pentagon ordered up half a million, and stuck about five thousand experimentally into high-risk soldiers and infantry.
