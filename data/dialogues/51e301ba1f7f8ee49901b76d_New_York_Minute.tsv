However... is when the inner office door swings open and the positions herself directly in front of him, PARKER Professor Spaulding? PROFESSOR SPAULDING Yes?
PARKER	May I have a moment of your time? PROFESSOR SPAULDING I'm sorry, but I have a plane to catch. tries to make a move. Parker blocks him.
PARKER	I know. But this is very important. PROFESSOR SPAULDING What is this about? PARKER Life and death, if you must know. Professor hesitates for just an instant, giving
PARKER	I'm Drew MacLeod.
PROFESSOR SPAULDING	Ms. MacLeod, I hope this is interesting.
PARKER	Trust me. leisurely make their way between classes. Yo! Coming through! Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the JIM You okay? old Drew is back. She scrambles out of the DREW Fine. and up the stairs -- then stops, turns. Wait right there. I mean, I don't want to be bossy. You don't have to stay right there, if you don't want to. JIM I'll be right here.
DREW	Great. launches herself into the building.
PARKER	I promise you, though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise, my studies would never suffer on account of my being unorganized. This was, and I think anyone who knows me would vouch for this, a complete anomaly. I was so thrown when my sister asked Bernard to the dance that I simply failed to post the schedule request and seeing it already checked off on my to-do list, I over-looked it until after the deadline had passed.
PROFESSOR SPAULDING	Ms. MacLeod, I recall your application being one of the strongest we received. Not seeing your name on the interview list surprised me. I assumed, of course, that you'd changed your mind. PARKER No. Not at all. This program is my number one priority. PROFESSOR SPAULDING Yes, well, I'm sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process. FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly DREW Professor Spaulding? I can't apologize enough for barging in like this. Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but
PROFESSOR SPAULDING	No. Please. It looks like I'm taking the red-eye now anyway. shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a DREW Parker? PARKER Hi, Parker.
DREW	What are you doing? PARKER Oh, the Professor and I have had a wonderful talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister, Drew, who screwed things up.
PROFESSOR SPAULDING	I'm having a little trouble following this. DREW You were... being me?
PROFESSOR SPAULDING	Would you like to sit down? her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip PARKER When I saw them take you to jail... PROFESSOR SPAULDING Jail?
PARKER	... I didn't think you'd make it. I knew I wouldn't be any good at it, but I figured at least there was a chance.
DREW	That's... sweet.
PARKER	You're not mad? DREW No. PARKER I'm so sorry for today. It's okay. But let's talk about it later. PROFESSOR SPAULDING Please. Go right ahead. PARKER Thank you.
DREW	Parker, consider, just for a moment, whether this is the appropriate time and place. PARKER Okay, I considered. What I want to say is, I didn't purposefully set out to ruin your day, but that doesn't mean I'm not a little... jealous. DREW Jealous?
PARKER	I'm not like you. I don't have your intensity, your focus, your... PROFESSOR SPAULDING Fashion sense? PARKER I just mean, maybe, even if I don't intend to, maybe that jealousy, you know, gets in the way sometimes. DREW You mean subliminally you're undermining me?
PARKER	I don't know if I'd get that technical about it. But yeah.
DREW	Well, thank you for saying that.
PARKER	You're welcome. Aren't you going to confess now?
DREW	Confess what? PROFESSOR SPAULDING There's got to be something. Like how you lost your shoes?
PARKER	How you're secretly jealous of me? DREW Why would I be jealous of you?
PARKER	Oh, let me see. Because I don't have a stick up my butt? Because I know how to have fun? Because I'm spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves? stops, ponders this deeply. DREW Nope. she smiles, only a teensy bit.
DREW	Well, maybe about the love slaves. is the first moment in a long time when the sisters
DREW	Professor, I'm Drew MacLeod.
PROFESSOR SPAULDING	Are you certain?
DREW	I wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of your program. I still do. But I failed. I didn't follow the rules. And honestly, before today, I didn't know how I was going to live with that. How to live with failure. I'm not good at it. I haven't done it much. But today I realized that I've lived in fear of it too long. I hope my application was a strong one and I came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into consideration. If you won't, I'll understand. Better yet, I'll get over it. Maybe I shouldn't be in such a hurry after all. Maybe it would be best for me to just take takes her DAYBOOK from Parker and drops it in the ... and lighten up. looks horrified at the sight of Drew's daybook in DREW Thanks for your time. Sorry if you missed your plane. shakes her hand. PROFESSOR SPAULDING It was worth it, I assure you. Now, could you clear up one thing for me? DREW/PARKER Sure. PROFESSOR SPAULDING What's this about jail? and Jim sit waiting when the Girls come out, turns to Parker. DREW Thanks. sisters hug, but we GO... ON PARKER -- EYES WIDE.
PARKER	Sis? Yeah? Gotta go. grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on, leans over, waving to Drew.
CHARLEY	Hi, baby! goes over to the truck. CHARLEY I was in the city. I tried to call you. Thought you might want a ride home. DREW Sure. CHARLEY Is that a new outfit? DREW Yeah. Hey, one minute, 'kay? CHARLEY Sure. goes back to Jim.
DREW	Thanks.
JIM	You're welcome. DREW I, uh...
JIM	You want to maybe... get together? DREW First I want to take a shower. For about a week. leans over and kisses him on the cheek. Then she Call me, okay?
JIM	You have a card? Aren't you in high school? smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. They
PARKER	Oh, man. I'm doomed. I'll never get home before them. WARREN Sure you will. pulls out a CELL PHONE, hits speed dial.
WARREN	Dad? Hey. I need a favor. over the City, Warren and Parker are strapped in,
PARKER	Warren, something tells me you're spoiled! WARREN Yes! But in a good way! QUINN Girls? steps in, grimfaced. QUINN How naive do you think I am? Girls share a look. Busted. PARKER We, uh, don't think you're naive, Mom.
DREW	No. Honestly, it was all an accident. holds out her hand revealing a BELLY RING.
QUINN	I know what this is. almost a palpable sense of relief between the QUINN Parker, I'm disappointed you'd do something like this without consulting me, but Drew? What got into you? Do you know how unhygienic those places are? DREW It was... spontaneous. QUINN Yeah. Obviously. Oh, by the way... holds out her other hand, which has an envelope.
QUINN	This came in the mail. stare at the envelope -- NYU ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT.
PARKER	So? Open it. a HONK. The guys are here! and Quinn stare at Drew. PARKER Come on!
DREW	It doesn't really matter one way or the other. Maybe I shouldn't be in such a hurry. Why don't we go out and have some fun. Besides, if this isn't good news, I don't want it to ruin our night. and Quinn simply continue to stare. and Warren are watching, too.
CHARLEY	So, how'd you two meet the girls? and Warren share a look. This is a story best left JIM/WARREN A dance/A class.
CHARLEY	Dance class, huh? Stupid me. I figured it had to be that day in New York when Parker blew off her chem test and Drew was in jail. smiles. He's not as out of it as he appears.
CHARLEY	Chips?
