CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.	We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within. Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON... Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses -- beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO -- A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes. But. The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET: FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!! superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
FLEEING PEOPLE.	Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE -- C--() ... .-4ï¿½_ s A N D A A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet. COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side... .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist: A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT! And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to shield his eyes... but STOFS: A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young, beautiful. SMILING. The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat? THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough. Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --
WES CLAIBORNE	Howdy. We're riding towards Absolution. You know how far west we are? The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.
LUKE CLAIBORNE	Maybe he's a dummy. Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --
WES CLAIBORNE	There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend? And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --
MOSE CLAIBORNE	Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and he's been shot.
LUKE CLAIBORNE	Bet he's a chain jumper. Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.
LUKE	If he escaped, there'll be a bounty. Let's bring him with us. Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
WES CLAIBORNE	Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn round and start walking. But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)	Dead or alive, no difference. I said
WALK OR--	THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
LUKE CLAIBORNE	-- P-please, God -- d-don't -- -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY. Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds. This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --
THE MAN IN BLACK	Absolution... With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off... sees the dog following... Get outta here. Leave me alone. But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is: dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him. His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.
THE MAN IN BLACK	Stay. The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound -- then A PISTOL COCKS behind him -- Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:
MEACHAM	Palms to heaven, Friend. The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.
THE MAN IN BLACK	Been shot.
MEACHAM	Only two kinds of men get shot -- criminals and victims. Which one're you?
THE MAN IN BLACK	don't know. Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...
MEACHAM	Got a name, son?
THE MAN IN BLACK	Don't know that either.
MEACHAM	What do you know?
THE MAN IN BLACK	... English.
MEACHAM	Odd wound. Looks... cauterized. Means somethin' burned it half closed. The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet? The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?" Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle -- Try'n hold still. He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces slightly, but bears the pain.
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	Where'd you ride in from?
THE MAN IN BLACK	West. Woke up in the desert. Looking up at the sun like I'd been dropped outta the sky.
MEACHAM	Seems I remember a story about that happening once... fella by the name of Lucifer. How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for short. But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror: That blood yours or somebody else's?
THE MAN IN BLACK	Three men rode up. Drew on me. My hands... moved on their own. Anything else you wanna confess to while you got my attention? And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:
THE MAN IN BLACK	Everything that happened before I woke up... It's gone.
MEACHAM	Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for your sins if you don't recall 'em. That bein' said... Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n' brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	I seen bad men do good things and good men do bad things. Whether you end up in heaven or hell... it's not God's plan... it's yours. You just got to remember what it was. The Man considers. Darkly --
THE MAN IN BLACK	What if I don't want to remember? Then you're probl'y goin' to hell. On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men! WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town -- HiS NAME ON IT! The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another Molotov, aiming for the SALOON -- But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:
NAT COLORADO	Percy! N2t the saloon!
PERCY	Why the goddamn hell not?!
NAT COLORADO	Cause your dady said so. Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS blankets as he moves past The Man --
MEACHAM	You wanna help or are you just gonna stand there and burn?!
MEACHAM	All right, folks -- don't panic! Get inside and you'll be fine... C'mon... Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	Put it out before it gets goin'! ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to -- WHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the LICORICE. Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands. OOPS:
KID	Just tryin' to save the candy. You one of my Pa's hired guns? Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY.
PERCY	Who the hell're yam? Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:
THE MAN	Nobody.
PERCY	Nobody is right. You think you can just collect your fifty dollars and ride off? You signed up for the wrong side, boy. The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:
PERCY (CONT'D)	Tell you what. You get down on your knees and kiss my boot. The Man's eyes narrow -- You do that and I'll let you run back to wherever the hell you came from so you can tell whoever you see... Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.
THE MAN	You want me to kiss your boot? Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:
PERCY	Tongue's just fine if you're feelin' amorous. Don't hold ba -- THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE! Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the
THE MAN	Kiss this, you sonofa -- -- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner, SHOTGUN RAISED.
PERCY	Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!! -- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm --
THE MAN	Wherever you came from? Go back. Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:
GREAVEY	Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!
PERCY	You goddamned shitheels! Don't you even THINK about leavin' me!!!! Colorado -- DECISION -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man --
NAT COLORADO	Be seeing you.
THE MAN	Look forward to it. With that, Nat spurs his horse -- YA! The others follow him as he RIDES HARD out of town. Percy growls at The Man --
PERCY	You are a dead man. You hear me? So help me God I will kill you my-- DM! The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him
KID	FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde! SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and
SHERIFF TAGGART	Emmett -- you all right? The Kid (now EMMETT) strides towards his father excitedly: a-f lap jack- then-stared-down-Nat-Colorado- like-he-wasn't-even-scared!!!! Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful --
SHERIFF TAGGART	Pardon my boy, mister. He can be excitable. Kyle Taggart. The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then --
THE MAN IN BLACK	. Luke.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of fifty dollars, actually. Our advert? The telegram? The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	Could use a man like you in case any of 'em come back...
THE MAN IN BLACK	-- I'm just passing through.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Fair enough. You don't mind spending the night, bank opens in the morning... I'll get you your money then. Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria I sent you. The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	You here with the prospector woman? The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back --
THE MAN IN BLACK	woman?
SHERIFF TAGGART	Yup. Real looker. Came into town yesterday with that there dog. She a friend of yours? ON THE MAN. His first real LEAD.
THE MAN IN BLACK	Maybe. And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...
DEPUTY WADE	Somethin' wrong, Kyle?
SHERIFF TAGGART	What's that French sayin' where you swear you seen someone before?
DEPUTY WADE	Don't speak French.
SHERIFF TAGGART	No... you sure's hell don't.
RANCH HAND #1	Should take it easy there, Pal --
RANCH HAND #2	Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink on the job.
ROY CLANTON	I don't give a damn what he don't like -- gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat. Gotta see a man about a buffalo... He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More FRAME. Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others:
RANCH HAND #1	You hear that?
RANCH HAND #2	Hear what? ANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them. And ANOTHER. ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY:
DOC	-- I know you are, don't lie to me!
MARIA	How many times do we have to do this, Arturo? J. love you.
DOC	Really? Do you?!? I found this in our bed! And I don't k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a watch because y insisted we buy this saloon! She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The
MARIA	We have customers. And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS.
ATTICUS	That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll drill him down.
MARIA	Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde. Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria
THE MAN IN BLACK	I'm looking for a woman. She gestures to the WHORES --
MARIA	What kind?
THE MAN IN BLACK	This kind. He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN.
MARIA	Never seen her before. But she is beautiful. Here's to you finding her, Senor. ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another: You have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into?
THE MAN IN BLACK	No. But I figured I'd be safe in here seein' as how that boy I tossed off his horse didn't wanna burn your saloon. Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then:
MARIA	It's not the boy you should worry about. It's his papa.
DOLARHYDE	Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you might call, the Tall Hog at the trough. His face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been working for me two weeks now, and I haven't had the pleasure. Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow
CLANTON	Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't -- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses -- STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS --
DOLARHYDE	Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the horses skittish. You partial to history? Here's a primer,
LISTEN CLOSE:	He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	Following the War Of Northern Aggression -- what some ironically refer to as the "Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation- wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies, Roy; populated by enterprising young drovers -- among 'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then turned 'em into the fattest herd West of the Chisholm Trail. Watched him work this lash, driving those steer til his fingers bled... but what good's a whip without a herd, Roy? And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt...
ROY CLANTON	Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a light in the sky -- blue -- and when I ran back the cows and fellas were gone!
DOLARHYDE	The sky. Opened up. And took my cows. Incoming HOOFBEATS -- Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters. APACHE. 50's. A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	Where's Percy?
NAT COLORADO	Jail. Sheriff locked him up. Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy:
DOLARHYDE	When're these people gonna lgarn? He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is
DOLARHYDE	Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to kill. As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman. Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED.
NAT COLORADO	Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It was a stranger. That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark:
DOLARHYDE	... What stranger?
NAT COLORADO	Usually a man gives off a scent. Where he's been. What he's done. He didn't have one. Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE:
DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE	Percy wouldn't've come in shooting without his daddy's say-so, Kyle. You best get ready for a war 'cause that's what's comin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Tomorrow we ride the little shit up Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's got a beef, he can take it up with the 6th cavalry. Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door --
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher scaring good people off their lan-- He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	Sonofabitch. WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW --
THE MAN IN BLACK	Another.
MARIA	You drink like a man who wants to forget.
THE MAN IN BLACK	Other way round. The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak. Atticus SLAMS down his silverware. Draws his GUN --
ATTICUS	You got three seconds to get your dog outta here or I blow his balls off.
THE MAN IN BLACK	Not my dog.
ATTICUS	Q=... two... -- and just before "three"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES, because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:
VOICE (O.S.)	Give you odds you don't get to 'three.' RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN. Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON. ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST
ATTICUS	I was just havin' some fun, Miss --
ELLA	Give- him, the steak. Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE
ELLA (CONT'D)	Now say you're sorry.
ATTICUS	I'm-- sorry.
ELLA	His name's 'Happy.' HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face
ATTICUS	I'm sorry... 'Happy.'
ELLA	Alright then. You're right. That was fun. -- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella What're you doing with my dog?
THE MAN IN BLACK	I was hoping you could tell me.
ELLA	The hell're you talking ab--? WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION: Where... did you get that? Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies. They move
SHERIFF TAGGART	Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me down to the office so we can have us a chat...? What for?
SHERIFF TAGGART	All due respect, I'm the law, mister. That's what for. The men LOCK EYES:
THE MAN IN BLACK	Tell you what, Sheriff. How about you keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I just walk outta here like we. never met?
SHERIFF TAGGART	Because we did meet. ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL:
THE MAN IN BLACK	L can't be accountable for what happens if they draw on me.
SHERIFF TAGGART	And what's gonna happen?
THE MAN IN BLACK	Best you don't find out.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Now why'd you have to go and say that? Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE --
THE MAN IN BLACK	Don't. But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight down on the Faro table -- TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)	I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb-- CRACK! The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL! The Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT: ELLA! Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that piece of paper he pulled from his office...
SHERIFF TAGGART	Yup -- looks just like him.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	"Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive." And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{: 1.) A tilted, handmade trail sign: "SAGUARO PASS." 2.) We're in a CABIN somewhere. BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS -- 3.) A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she looks at us and SCREAMS -- 4.) Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave? As some kind of TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes -- 5.) Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see: 6.) A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a
PERCY	You're a dead. Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality. My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're gonna end up another dead shitheel under his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer for a long, long -- Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars,
JAKE	Shut up. Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head. with a real sense of PURPOSE:
ELLA	I need to see Lonergan. It's important.
DEPUTY WADE	'Fraid not, Miss -- we're preppin' him for transport. And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men. HOLD on Ella
SHERIFF TAGGART	What happened to him? Man walked into a bar. Taggart shakes his head as Charlie and a deputy unlock Percy's cell, CUFF HIM, drag him out. Taggart points to Jake:
SHERIFF TAGGART	Step back against the wall there. Move and I shoot you dead.
JAKE	You should've let me go.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee. You put down six of my deputies.
JAKE	Six was all you had.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.
JAKE	Yeah? What's in Phoenix?
SHERIFF TAGGART	What you got comin', Jake Lonergan. Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	Aggravated banditry, 17 counts, Forgery, Blackmail, Hijacking, injurious use of a cattle prod, Arson, Incitement of Whorehouse Riot, and Trespassing with intent to deflower. You're also leader of a gang of outlaws includin' Creek Johnson and Bull McCade, which makes you accessory to every law they broke too.
JAKE	That it?
SHERIFF TAGGART	Saved the best for last... 'Murder.' That LANDS on Jake. Wondering if this is TRUE. Evenly --
JAKE	It say who I killed?
SHERIFF TAGGART	Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice Wills. Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	If I were a bettin' man, I'd say this would be Ms. Wills, would it not? Jake just stares, CONFUSED. SHAKEN.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	They found her dead in a cabin round Saguaro Pass, twenty miles west of here. With that, a CLUE falls into place: SAGUARO PASS.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	Deed was in your name. He slips the photo back in the brim, tosses the hat to Jake:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)	Dead hooker with a hole in her chest, in your cabin, plus your sterling reputation equals guilty as goddamned sin. And you're gonna hang for it. At gunpoint, Taggart PUSHES Jake out the door -- an incoming WIND. Across the valley, a massive BLACK CLOUD
GREAVEY	blue light... Clanton said he saw blue light before the cows disappeared...
DOLARHYDE	Just a storm.
COLORADO	No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait 'til it passes. But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees
DOLARHYDE	No time, they put him in an iron coach. With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks -- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:
DEPUTY WADE	Gimme your wrist. Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a
JAKE	What're you --?
CHARLIE	Best way to make a man stay put: chain him to his enemy. You lovebirds have a nice trip now. SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit. Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down:
EMMETT	You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give Percy a lickin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART	He's bad enough.
EMMETT	. can I come with you?
SHERIFF TAGGART	Too dangerous.
EMMETT	Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why can't Charlie just take him?
SHERIFF TAGGART	Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what these people pay me to do. And your mother would kill me if I brought you. Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --
EMMETT	Good thing she's already dead then. And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS: THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE. Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:
ELLA (CONT'D)	Tell me where you got that bracelet...
JAKE	Maybe you should'a asked before you knocked me out..
ELLA	Please... I need to know. Just tell me where you got it.
JAKE	Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my name or where I've been or any of the things they said I done, so leave me the hell alone. And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the cover the coach in a protective ring. Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH: Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain -- He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons -- ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too -- This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town, the WIND picks up -- As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella
ELLA	NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE
UNDERGROUND NAT!	But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!! The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN -- Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN! THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES
STRIPPED RIGHT OFF THEIR FALSE FRONTS LIKE PIANO KEYS!	Okay, wait. Just wait. Take a breath. 'Cause it's about ... . to get... . MORE insane...
MEACHAM	Jesus God!! STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out -- Yeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS: of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone. THIS IS A...Qlp lam. EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him -- Emmett runs into his dad's embrace --
EMMETT SHERIFF TAGGART	What's happening?! -- Stay _by-mvside! A_LIVERY_STABLE -- the HORSES stamp in their stalls as Taggart tears the door open and rushes Emmett inside; as he's about to follow... am c1:t lU 01 If -- a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his With a "C'MON!!!" she rushes him through the FRENZIED CROWD -- -- but WHOOSH! A METAL COLLAR CLAMPS AROUND WADE AND YANKS HIM Percy RELENTS. Offers up his hand. Jake grabs all of Percy's against the wall, FORCING Percy's hand out of the cuff -- and THROUGH THE CROWD -- DOLARHYDE hears his son SCREAM. SEES the
DOLARHYDE	Colorado! Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 -- BANG! -- shatters the coach lock -- they PULL Percy out: As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out, ON JAKE. He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much coiling up around his arm -- WHAT? HOW? -- as it becomes... HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits:
ELLA	Everyone inside! GO GO GO!! Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT -- it! He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ." Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's And all... is... STILL. As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE.

DOLARHYDE	Who the hell're ?
NAT COLORADO	He's the one who caged Percy. Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --
DOLARHYDE	Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?
JAKE	-- why're you asking m&?! Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:
DOLARHYDE	This! Where'd you get this?! It was shooting the same light beams they were --
JAKE	Let go of my wrist.
DOLARHYDE	-- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you tell me what the he-- KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out of the church stumbles... AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted -- limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE DIRT. Holy SHIT. Ella's adrenaline dynamo starts to die down, replaced now by SHOCK. And for what seems like the first time, FEAR. She EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people converge around the corpse:
EMMETT	Is it... dead? Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS --
DOLARHYDE	. The hell j,,a it? A demon. They all turn to see MEACHAM. TERRIFIED.
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	Revelations 16:14: "For there are spirits of demons, showing signs." Escaped from hell itself.
EMMETT	Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those bracelet things too! Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET. ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado bends closer to the corpse... SCARED...
NAT COLORADO	I think... it's comin' from somewhere inside it. People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near- more BRAVADO than actual courage:
DOLARHYDE	Only one way to find out. We need to cut it open. You're a doctor. Got a bone saw? DOC snaps out of his stupor, looks up, FREAKED --
DOC	. Are you... serious?
DOLARHYDE	Wake u Those things took your wife --
DOLARHYDE	Well this one here's our only chance of findin' where they went. That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...
DOLLARHYDE	So you got a bone saw or don't you? -- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:
DOC	Stay outside. You're not welcome in here! Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --
DOLARRYDE	I own more of this town than any man in it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn please. And for the record? You ain't welcome in my country, Mexican. Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --
ELLA	Whatever troubles you had don't mean a damn thing against the ones we got now. We wanna see our way through 'em, your guns better start pointing in the same direction, Goddammit. Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS. Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --
DOC	If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open... am I going to burn for it? Meacham hesitates a beat, then CROSSES the air in front of Doc --
MEACHAM	That should cover ya. ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --
DOC	Excuse me. B GH! He PUKES on the ground.
EMMETT	Jesus, Doc!!! Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --
DOC	This is not normal. I'm entitled to vomit. We should XU be vomiting.
DOLARHYDE	Just cut, Lardass. Doc GLARES... with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --
DOC	Senor? A hand? You too, maricon. The men all grip the chest plate and PULL -- A DISGUSTING CRACK.
EMMETT	Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.
MEACHAM	Emmett.
EMMETT	Sorry, Father. Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores...
DOC	Chet wall's partially collapsed... no familiar organs of any kind...
DOLARHYDE	'course they're not familiar. Just look at this th-- SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the
DOC	Spinal reflex. And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around
MEACHAM	Something on your neck. Hold still. Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	I'll be damned... gold. They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath 'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet:
NAT COLORADO	Down here too. This much ore... could only have come from a digging in a mine. That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up to see Jake READING her in this moment.
EMMETT	In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.
DOC	Gimme my scalpel. In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB:
DOLARHYDE	Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?
DOC	Nothing, just pulled it off -- He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS: Only works when it's touching the creature. Colorado moves closer... rainbow light flickering across his face...
NAT COLORADO	I think... it's a compass. Look: No matter how you move it, it points in the same direction.
EMMETT	Compasses point north. That's west.
MEACHAM	West's where 141 came from. ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.
EMMETT	If you're right, what's it pointing to?
ELLA	The rest of 'em. Be my guess.
DOLARHYDE	Then that's where I'm goin'. He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	One of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten minutes ago, I figured him for a liar. Nobody takes my cattle.
MEACHAM	Your b was taken too. A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION? But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:
DOLARHYDE	I noticed.
NAT COLORADO	What if they're already dead?
EMMETT	They're not dead.
ELLA	Kid's right. If all they wanted was to kill us, they would've.
DOLARHYDE	Looked to me like... they were ropin' people. Means they need 'em for something. Whatever it is, we can either stand here guessin'... or go find out. His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks at each other, working up the courage to face what they know
DOC	If she's alive -- if there's even a
MEACHAM	Lord hates a coward... but our bullets were useless against those things. Other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and outnumbered. As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat.
JAKE	Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --
ELLA	You got everything to do with it. If you can remember where you got that thing --
JAKE	I remember you all wantin' me on the end of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin' here's got nothin' to do with me.
ELLA	You sure. about that? He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay to debate it -- turns to go --
EMMETT	Mr. Lonergan? Sir? The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.
EMMETT (CONT'D)	My mother died last year. My Paw... he's all I got. And despite a fleeting moment of SYMPATHY, Jake darkens --
JAKE	Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere near you, your Pa... or anyone else in this goddamned town. OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:
ELLA	That's it? You're just gonna run away?
JAKE	No, Sister. I'm walking away.
ELLA	Well s w. As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the
JAKE ELLA	SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp. Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --
JAKE	What's your damn problem?!
ELLA	You're comin' with us.
JAKE	I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw that rock I swear I'll-- WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder --
ELLA	If you're walkin' away from here, what the hell're you walking tsQ? That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And that's the last thing he's gonna admit --
JAKE	What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady? 'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like suicide to me. -- now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:
ELLA	I... just wanna help these people.
JAKE	Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw your face light up the minute you knew that thing might lead you to gold. And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --
ELLA	It's not gold I want, you dumb sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.
JAKE	And what's that?
ELLA	Remange. Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She stares at him, DEAD ON: And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver dollar... its what you want, too. With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face Was the Devil come to Absolution... come to drag our town down to hell... SERIES OF SHOTS - AS DUSK TAI .t $. TQ .NIGItT: Though BURNING EMBERS, Emmett helps a LITTLE GIRL pull her half- but our town's not just a buncha buildings, Brothers and Sisters -- Nossir. Our town is fie. Good, God- fearing souls. Pure and hopeful. And the devil can't never take that away... Ella and Doc tend to WOUNDED PEOPLE in a triage area as... Meacham finds his overturned PULPIT. Determination in his eyes, sermon/call-to-arms -- every survivor GATHERED AROUND:
MEACHAM (CONT'D)	In times of darkness, God asks that we come together so we may stand and fight. So we're goin' after our kin. Any of you aren't able or prepared, no shame in it. Head up to Fort Huachuca, join up with the garrison there and pray... Rest of us ride out at sun-up to recover that which we have lost. SUNRISE: Pistol chambers SPINNNN -- rifles are COCKED --
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Thy will be done, Lord, and there's an amen behind it. Lo and behold, most of the town survivors are just too damn scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort. CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --
DOLARHYDE	Somebody got something to say? His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and Meacham climb onto the wagon: Sure we need to bring that thing along? Doc nods as he TWISTS the forceps in the Alien's eye, the COMPASS HOLOGRAM flickering to life before them:
DOC	If this arrow points me back to Maria? Yeah -- J'm sure. Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung around his back:
MEACHAM	Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.
EMMETT	I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the only master bowman in my archery club. Won the county tournament by shootin' a flipped nickel at 50 paces.
MEACHAM	Somethin' tells me these things don't carry nickels, son. Answers's no.
EMMETT	You want me to ride off with the chickenshits, then double back, be happy to. But let's just skip that part and get to it, Padre. And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:
MEACHAM	Go fill your canteen, dammit. He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from
ELLA	C'mon, Happy. But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?
JAKE	Oh shut up. Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
DOLARHYDE	I was ridin' into town to kill you for what you done to my son. You owe me your life, Boy. Ride with us, we'll call it square. His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly.
JAKE	You that fast? -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:
JAKE	Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square. In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
DOLARHYDE	Follow him. Soon as he's got his back turned... kill him. Shit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: "Do it." Finally Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off... JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and Doc on the WAGON:
MEACHAM	Figure out which way you're headed yet?
JAKE	West. Saguaro Pass.
MEACHAM	That's not what I meant. The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off. A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN: Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot -- MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B&
THE WOMAN	You shouldn't have. She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's talking to JAKE.
JAKE	Got you somethin' else. CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
THE WOMAN	Where'd you get this?
JAKE	Where do you think? The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
THE WOMAN	Your boys '11 come after you. ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:
JAKE	Let 'em come. She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft. But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window: A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town. The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and -- REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman? Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:
ONE OF THE GOLD COINS	EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY -- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE!
THE WOMAN	What's happening?!!! She manages to GRAB a doorknob and DANGLES UPWARD, CHOKING as -- A DEMONIC SILHOUETTE drops in front of them! JESUS!! Jake draws his pistol and FIRES! The demon SHRIEKS IN RAGE as SPIKED PLUMES fan out from its huge, elongated skull... making it look like a SILHOUETTED It QIAï¿½1.-L 2 A T EI! R HEADDRESS! Its HIDEOUS FACE comes into the light -- AN AIJIE -- as it raises its arm, wearing a WRIST BRACELET that reshapes into a JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his side (now we know how he woke up with it in the desert) --
JAKE	Alice! As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS... and FLIES AT JAKE, As he STUMBLES back -- GASPING -- touching his neck --
JAKE (CONT'D)	"Alice"... Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF. All he knows is, it was THEM. The creatures killed her. And this revelation... well, it galvanizes him with RAGE. Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE... then-- flying, they go hurling THROUGH THE WALL -- LANDING HARD on the other side -- aaballs-out. messy. close-quarter death match -- Jake -- EYES POPPING -- SEES THE GUN just out of reach -- fingers GRASP for it -- seconds before he PASSES OUT He GRABS the gun and swings it back -- BLAMMII!Colorado ROLLS aside as the WALL where his head just was BLOWSOPEN--and Jake's ON HIM, PISTOL WHIPPING HIM MERCILESSLYuntilheSPINS the gun back around and POINTS IT between Colorado's eyes: ON JAKE -- quaking with rage -- he wants to kill this guy so bad eye in the back of the wagon. Greavey, Dolar's ranch hand, heels up to ELLA. COCKY SWAGGER:
GREAVEY	So... what's a pretty lady like y--
ELLA	-- you finish that sentence, I shoot you in your beef whistle. Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes
GREAVEY	Ma'am. And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:
DOLARHYDE	Tell me somethin', Kid... why didn't your father just take my money? What money?
UOLARHY DE	offered him a thousand dollars to leave town. He could's taken you outta harm's way, relocated... found you a new momma. And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:
EMMETT	Is it true Percy's momma died givin' birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde? Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:
DOLARHYDE	Yeah.
EMMETT	Then maybe you should use that thousand dollars to buy yourself a new wife. Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:
DOC	Madre Dios... And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's reacting to -- AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even Dolarhyde looks nervous now:
DOLARYHYDE	What the... hell is it?
MEACHAM	It was Winfield's Landing. They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN: Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133." ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?
GREAVEY	You tryin' to tell me those... things pulled the whole damn town into the sky? And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where: SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --
MEACHAM	That can't be good. The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND
DOLARHYDE	Scatter. -- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly... It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH. The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
DOC	Should we... open it?
DOLARHYDE	Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn--
EMMETT	-- oops -- -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out. FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground: Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth, connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
GREAVEY	Boss... it's one'a yours. Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:
EMMETT	Is-- is this what happened to my Pa? Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
DOC	This was stuck down its throat... to help it breathe. That means they wanted to keep it alive, Emmett. I'm sure your father is fine. But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:
MEACHAM	Why'd they dump it?
ELLA	Whatever they needed from it, they must've got. Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving. She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is
EMMETT	Ho-ly shit. BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below: AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --
DOC	"Colorado Queen." The river's two hundred miles from here. But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up
ELLA	Son of a bitch. IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:
JAKE	Your man got it in his head that he was s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his ear 'til he says sorry. As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --
DOLARHYDE	Why'd you let him live? Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now --
JAKE	Gonna need him. He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:
JAKE (CONT'D)	Nice boat. What's that smell?
ELLA	That'd be me. He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.
JAKE	Why're you blue? Cause I missed ya. Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them.
DOLARHYDE	We better keep movin'. A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.
JAKE	Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til it passes. How's that sound, Nat? Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:
DOLARHYDE	Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'. Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:
NAT COLORADO	Too hard tracking anything in the rain. Dolarhyde GLARES at Colorado, who GLARES BACK: his loyalty now WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND. Poking out. Motionless. HOLD on it, longer than we're comfortable. window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone. Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
DOLARHYDE	You okay?
COLORADO	Yeah. Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --
DOLARHYDE COLORADO	Lemme clean it for you or it'll get -- -- I'm fine. Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.
DOLARHYDE	Say it.
COLORADO	Is Percy worth dyin' for? Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then --
DOLARHYDE	He's my son. I take care of my kin, Nat. ON COLORADO as that lands. Clearly, there's something here... a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES. Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER. ON DOLARHYDE. The kid's naked emotion AFFECTING him, but the Hey. Kid. Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES. Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	Take a drink and shut p. He gets up, walks off. Leaving the kid with the flask. As Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --
DOC	We brought enough water.
MEACHAM	Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'. Doc nods: ah. Turns to go... STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:
DOC	Padre... Maria came to see you in confession every Sunday. It seemed... she had a lot to talk about. Was she having an affair? Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc --
MEACHAM	You know I can't say. And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --
DOC	The last thing I said to her... I... Please. If I'm wrong about my wife... I don't want to die angry. Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.
MEACHAM	You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on you once we get her back. 'Til then? Don't die. And OFF DOC, thunder CRACKS -- Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS... . until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss- crossed LASH MARKS on her back. She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing
JAKE	You missed a spot.
ELLA	The hell,-re- you doing here?
JAKE	Mindin' my own business. Then you decided to take a shower.
ELLA	Why didn't you say anything?
JAKE	Givin' you privacy. She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
ELLA	. she's pretty. Who was she? Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:
JAKE	only thing I know's her name was Alice... And she's dead. Ella looks up at him. INTO him --
ELLA	Maybe you loved her. Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:
JAKE	All you women are the same -- Always wanna make it about Goddamn "love." Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same. There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF:
JAKE	Don't matter. She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.
ELLA	So what dj= matter? Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips,
JAKE	What matters is I find the thing that killed her. And make it pay. And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his Where'd you see this before? A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie. -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've asked me if you didn't recognize it. Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES: Those things... they the ones who put those marks on your back? She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and ANGER at what was done to her.
ELLA	They took my people. Destroyed where I'm from.
JAKE	Where's that?
ELLA	North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town. Best I figure, they're hidin' in a mine. Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:
JAKE	Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me --
ELLA	-- what, you would've stuck around? Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than I could've stopped these people from going after their kin. Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and we're gonna need all the guns we can get. Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style:
JAKE	So that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you? Cause of my gun? There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back:
ELLA	No, not your gun. What you do with it. Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION. Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS... Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY --
GREAVEY	What the hell're we doin' here? We should be ridin' in the opposite direction of those things --
COBBETT	We do that, the old man's likely to shoot us himself. Only way outta this is -- And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:
GREAVEY	. what's that smell? -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE -- GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY: HEAR the SCREAMS -- Happy takes off -- they RACE after him --
DOC AND MEACHAM	Hear them too -- grabs their PISTOLS -- and Doc, his CANTEEN -- Colorado snatches up a WINCHESTER, LOADS IT, throws another one
DOLARHYDE	Get behind me, Boy -- THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and -- THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH! HURLS Dolar aside -- hand with the pistol to the wall in return. He STRUGGLES as the BOOM! The Alien's shoulder EXPLODES ORANGE FLUORESCENT BLOOD as a GUNSHOT rings out -- it's Dolarhyde, back on his feet aid through the hatch where Emmett fled -- And the fire's GROWING around the boat -- Jake's bracelet OPENS UP into that BLASTER and it's AIMED at The
JAKE	Don't know if you understand me... but you hurt that boy and I hurt you. Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the alien with HOLY WATER... but NOTHING happens! And then -- The Alien STRIKES -- SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE The Alien SPRINGS through a doorway, TAKING EMMETT WITH IT. Ella RUSHES after it as Jake RUNS to Meacham, hanging impaled:
JAKE	Easy, now... Don't move, dammit --
MEACHAM	Go after the boy... then you get our people back...
JAKE	Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS-- But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:
MEACHAM	Listen up... 'cause I'm not gonna be able to say it again -- God don't care who you were, Son... only who you Mg. ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES -- Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD streaking into the desert. Happy BARKING MADLY. Ella drops to
NAT COLORADO	That thing... was dead... it was d-ead... DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY:
DOLARHYDE	I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed the kid. ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE:
JAKE	Then we'd better get him back.
EMMETT	Damn. You are one ugly bastar-- PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move -- The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like... .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy. The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS: This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON. Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES... BLOOD on some rocks.
NAT COLORADO	West. Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar --
GREAVEY	Boss, only took one of them things to kill four of us. We got no chance here. Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED --
DOLARHYDE	You're a goddamn coward. You work for me, dammit. You're my m e 1 1 Qyees. And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:
GREAVEY	Fine line between a coward and a fool. The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them --
DOLARHYDE	You're all FIRED! Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:
DOC	Looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you. Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man... Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS overhead with a bad feeling:
JAKE	Clouds've been moving east since sun- up... 'cept that one. ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground -- the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled -- A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN: SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them. As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS... One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle --
OUTLAW	I say we just shoot 'em and take their-- But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:
OUTLAW (CONT'D)	. Boss? Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC -JAKE. Both outlaws and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE:
HUNT	What the hell you doin' back here, Lonergan? Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA. COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:
BRONC	Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he sees you. And who the hell're they? ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him, SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY --
HUNT	What's the matter, Jake. Cat got your--? SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face,
JAKE	Since when're Qy the one asking the goddamned questions!?! Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a good OFFENSE. The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they
HUNT	Christ, Jake... You broke my tooth
JAKE	Quit whining. Now bring me to the rest of the boys, if that meets with your goddamn approval. Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above: As they RIDE OFF, Dolarhyde looks to Jake and mutters:
DOLARHYDE	Nice company you keep.
ELLA	What the hell're you doing? If we don't catch up to that kid, we're never gonna--
JAKE	They called me "Boss." You wanna go after these things with five or fifty? Like you said: we can use every gun we can get. Qh. That actually makes SENSE. But --
ELLA	What exactly're you gonna say to 'em? Tell you when I figure it out. And he SPURS onward, leaving her to follow uneasily -- OUR ALIEN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN from stalactites by four spindly limbs. Mid sleep cycle. And inches below its head... EMMETT, still webbed to the wall. Unable to move or speak, FOUR DARK SHAPES blot out light, GLIDING IN... A gang of FOUR MORE ALIENS dismounts. The biggest and STRONGEST -- their LEADER -- barks GUTTURAL CLICKS at the alien who kidnapped Emmett. Kidnapper explaining as it removes another STRANGE DEVICE. The device beams a HOLO-PROJECTION... OF ELLA'S FACE! The aliens HISS in furious RECOGNITION. JESUS... is this some kind of otherworldly WANTED POSTER? PLUMES fan out angrily from the Leader's HUGE, ELONGATED SKULL -- It's the alien who killed Jake's woman! We'll come to know it as... THE SLAVER. It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed: A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP. This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE WEAPON. It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at -- instead it SLICES THROUGH THE WEBBING that pins the boy to the FLAILS, punching, kicking to no avail -- but then:
DOLARHYDE'S FLASK	Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver -- IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING! the webbing from his mouth:
EMMETT	Holy SHIT. Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming! back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE! Climbing onto an old desert stump -- BLAM! It's SHOT OFF by a piled on a WAGON. We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason... One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss
CREEK JOHNSON	Hey --- ï¿½s 4 Lay off that whiskey and saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we best damn be sober for it. Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other
CREEK JOHNSON	'Bout time you got back. What the hell happened to you?!? Hunt nods over his shoulder --
HUNT	He did. The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
CREEK JOHNSON	well, shit. It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is the man in charge. Dismounts:
JAKE	You don't look happy to see me, Creek. Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:
CREEK JOHNSON	We're fixin' to rob us a train in about twenty minutes and you come ridin' in like nothin' ever happened? No. Lonergan. I ain't happy to see you. ON JAKE. How to navigate bad blood that he doesn't REMEMBER?
JAKE	Well I'm sure you'll get over it. Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the
JAKE (CONT'D)	Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not going after a train -- We're going after something else. The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.
BRONC	But Jake... you-- you said you didn't wanna be in charge no more. And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep IMPROVISING to hold his ground:
JAKE	Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the hell up.
CREEK JOHNSON	They're not going anywhere with you. Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)	You got some balls on you -- walkin' outta here a week ago sayin' what you said and doin' what you did and then ridin' back in here and givin orders. Just who the hell do you think you are? The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)	So. Are you her?
ELLA	Am I who?
CREEK JOHNSON	The whore Jake quit this gang for. OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:
JAKE	Watch your mouth, Creek.
CREEK JOHNSON	Or what? These boys are with = now. jID in charge. You may be fast, but you are goddamned outgunned. ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --
JAKE	That a fact, Boys? But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:
CREEK JOHNSON	Put your guns on the whore. He so much as twitches, blow her brains out her ear. AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
JAKE	Call her a whore again, that'll be the last word you ever say.
CREEK JOHNSON	You ain't in no position to make threats, asshole. Hunt: take his gun. Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls the PISTOL from Jake's holster:
HUNT	Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal. Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.
CREEK JOHNSON	Put him down, Bull. And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD --
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)	Where the hell's our gold. Jake? "Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant:
JAKE	Don't remember. Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA -- at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too.
CREEK JOHNSON	Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was leavin' us high and dry because you were in love... You just left out the part about taking half our goddamned haul from the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold? -- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)	Man can't run away from who he ja, Lonergan... you really think you could go straight just cause you were fool enough to fall in love with some woman? WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we:
ALICE	You sure you wanna give it all up? ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE.
JAKE	What about you? Once we're gone, you ain't ever comin' back. She touches his face so gently. And whispers:
ALICE	You're the first person ever believed I was better than this place... so I gotta believe in y=. You're a good man, Jake Lonergan. PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_
CREEK JOHNSON	You figgered you could steal from us? All that gold was yours to take co you could go off and start a new life? Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another: TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he
ALICE	Your boys'ii come after you.
JAKE	Let 'em come. BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP: Okay... okay, I remember now... Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when you get to hell, you can ask for it back. Okay then. That's the way you wanna do this... Kill the whore. ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella -- This is IT -- JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as -- the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek:
JAKE	Told you not to call her that. ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of
JAKE (CONT'D)	You're all riding with me. Any one of you decides otherwise? So help me God, I'll kill you where you stand. I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say, Boss..." Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful.
DOC	Dios mio.
DOLARHYDE	Jesus... it's the kid. As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER: The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP,
DRAGGED AWAY!	Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.
THE SLAVER	His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker. ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd: QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is the one responsible for it. And we're: BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:
JAKE (CONT'D)	You. Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere annoyance. Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE NECKS of the outlaws, activating "Blue": !NTLY E ZE. TUR an The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE -- limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns -- Find cover!!! Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC, EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON. The Aliens FIRE life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens --
ANOTHER ALIEN	Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as: Ella REACTS -- WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically -- Oh my GOD -- Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him -- As ELLA leaps on a horse --
THE SLAVER	Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA
SKIER BEHIND A SPEEDBOAT!	ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! And there's a LOGIC SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY --
JAKE ON THE HORSE	Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on Jake still in pursuit but suddenly...
PINKERTON #1	You hear.that?
PINKERTON #2	How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard. No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr-- When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE... but now they SEE
PINKERTON #2 (CONT'D)	1 stand corrected. They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and -- Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY
THE PINKERTONS RUSH TO THE ROOF EDGE	-- SXLSKLISH! The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND, cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car -- Then in a BLUR, it's GONE. Jake's blaster REVERTS into a bracelet. When the smoke clears: ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder. Jake REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms. She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING... but goes LIMP.
JAKE	Ella...? Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as... HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado, Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:
EMMETT	Aw no... is she --? Jake looks up -- unhinged --
NAT COLORADO	We need to get out of here NOT. Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam -- -- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER! -- This is Apache territory! They catch us, they'll kill u-- THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground inches from Jake's hand! Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as -- APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL. Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett to the ground --
NAT COLORADO (CONT'D)	Nobody move. Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM. Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS: Jake is alone. Overwhelmed. Raw. Something rising in him. Something he COULDN'T FACE... until this moment:.
JAKE	I remember now. I-- I did love her. And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of EMOTION to the surface... but he FIGHTS it. A losing battle, as She was like you. Seemed to think I was a good man. But I couldn't save either of you. A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face...
JAKE (CONT' D )	Where's the good in that? His eyes CLOSE. Too much.
JAKE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, Ella. And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past -- -- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as... ELLAIg BODY IS
EMMETT	Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan. Those things... were lookin' for her. Had a picture and everything. That breaks the spell. Jake looks over --
JAKE	What d'you mean... 'a picture'?
EMMETT	Floatin', like that arrow thing we found in its eye. Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark,
DOC	What'd he say?
COLORADO	"Kill them. And make it quick." Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move for them, MENACING --
DOC	Now'd be a good time to use your gun bracelet, my friend. But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him. His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE. Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM -- SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	How is it that you speak our language?
UOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE)	Because I'm a damn genius. Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	Forget about quick. Make him feel it. The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)	Two hundred head of cattle! Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)	I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a here in a day's time if you let me go. ON GREY WOLF. Considering this. And how do I know you'll come back? Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)	You can keep my associate here. if I don ' t come back, you can kill him. Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	Why should I believe that you even care about this man? Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)	Because he's my son. Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado with those unyielding eyes --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	Is this true? And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:
COLORADO	Yeah... he's my father. REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	Three hundred head. Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's Two fifty. HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	Cut him loose. The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go...
EMMETT	Hey! What about =?!? ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.
DOLARHYDE	What about you, kid? And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind... GONE. And now, it's back to business --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	Kill all of them except the half-breed. Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it:
JAKE	What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT. And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH: close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely feminine, yet... ALJM. PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she
ELLA	. what... happened? ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.
EMMETT	You... died. Ella looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her. . oh. OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain -- a step TOWARD him:
ELLA	If I'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me -- -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he isn't showing it:
JAKE	Did you hear what I said?
ELLA	.. What?
JAKE	When you were playin' possum. Did you hear what I mid? He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it, something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.
ELLA	No. I was mendin'. It's like sleep. His eyes narrow, trying to understand:
JAKE	How's it you look like one of us?
ELLA	I can look like whatever I want to.
JAKE	So you can't die?
ELLA	Sure I can. If my heart stops beating... just like you.
.JAKE	You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're one'a them. we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So desperately wants to reach him...
ELLA	I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different place. He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:
JAKE	The one that took you. It killed her. That LANDS on her. Knowing and painful.
ELLA	They call him The Slaver. He's the one, gave me the scars. Broke me. And made me watch... while he killed my family too. Even with his guard up... Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to: He stalks down, LEAVING FRAME -- as we HOLD on the field of
ELLA (V.0.)	For every drop of light in the sky, there's another world. Filled with life...
ELLA	Our race was first to map the stars... that's why they came for us. Took our planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered anyone who fought hack. Ones who survived were turned into slaves. Trackers. She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.
ELLA (CONT'D)	They brought me aboard one of their scout ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to find other planets like mine. Planets they can take... people they can enslave. As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first to understand...
JAKE	X lead 'em here. Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.
EMMETT	Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
ELLA	I never wanted this. But they got... ways. Of making you do things. Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of
ELLA (CONT'D)	Been tryin' to make it right... tried to blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all their fuel, then escaped down here. 'Cept it didn't work... damn thing survived.
JAKE	Where is it. Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:
ELLA	Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure, they'll find enough fuel to leave by tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring back the others.
DOC	"others"?
ELLA	The whole fleet. They'll take what they need. Everyone on this planet. Anything too weak to survive... they'll toss. Like that cow. Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.
NAT COLORADO	What'd you mean, they're looking for "fuel"...? And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:
JAKE	Gold. That's why they're in a mine.
ELLA	. wherever it is, that's where you escaped from -- and it's the only way back up to the ship. Even with your memory wiped, your instincts kicked in -- That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it reacts. Somehow you took it off one of 'em... don't you remember any of it? ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and: the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE. ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES: BLAM SLAM! We BLAST the creature to oblivion -- we're FREE! JAKE IN PRESENT -- Eyes ALIVE with MEMORY:
JAKE	I-- I blasted my way out... MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern -- ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see: That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON -- the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven -- JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now:
JAKE (CONT'D)	I remember seeing a tower... made of stone... on the rim of a canyon... Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS:
ELLA	What? What's he sayin'?!? Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:
COLORADO	That rock you're talkin' about... he- knows where it is.
SHERIFF TAGGART	You... all right...? DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward. . Fantastic. You? Absolution is here... a hundred others from the now-cratered town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN. the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE: -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE: A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART. Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE: ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging our men across the cavern where we reveal... . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE. Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_ seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe ! WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares. Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID. This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert. More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS. HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process. All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...
NAT COLORADO	This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe. As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:
JAKE	That's it. As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see... What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below, amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive.
DOC	Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort. Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)	The Kiowa... they were taken too. Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...
ELLA	Transports. Way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship.
DOC	Place is crawling with those things. We'll never even get close. Grey Wolf SPEAKS --
NAT COLORADO	He says there's a back way in... The Twin Rivers run underneath this whole canyon. Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles East. Lead right down there. Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED.
JAKE	The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud? Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:
DOC	Just so I got this straight... three of those things just kicked the shit out of and now you two're gonna ride right into that fort, try to hijack one'a those-- He pauses on the word --
ELLA	"Transports."
DOC	-- ride it up to that space boat --
ELLA	Spaceshp.
DOC	Then bring it down here and get everybody off alive? That's your big plan? Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:
JAKE	Yup.
DOC	And just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place?
JAKE	Poke a hornet's nest... they swarm at'cha.
ELLA	You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a distraction. A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:
DOC	You want us to storm that fort? Against those things? With less than fifty men? It's suicide.
EMMETT	It ain't, it's been done! I read at school how Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they weren't but a small garrison and they were outgunned --
ELLA	We need all of you to make a stand. Together. It's the only way.
NAT COLORADO	Make a stand with what? Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp -- the
JAKE	This. An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time... they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:
EMMETT	Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs. Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:
JAKE	Somethin' funny?
NAT COLORADO	Yeah... that you whites finally know what it feels like to face extinction. Now that we're on the same side, he says we can all die together. They're with us. The LOOK holds between them --
JAKE	Guess that means you're not waitin' for your dad to come back. Colorado's face CLOUDS. Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:
NAT COLORADO	Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole life... first time he ever copped to it was to save his own ass. He's not comin' back. And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR -- Pieces of CLOTH are RIPPED, stuffed inside the WHISKEY BOTTLES. Emmett works with Apaches and their KIDS, roping WOOD together WAR PAINT is applied to faces in DARK STREAKS... Jake slips on his coat. Sees Emmett lead a horse to mount up with his BOW and ARROW QUIVER:
JAKE	Not you, Kid.
EMMETT	Aw, hell, we been through this. Ya can't stop me. Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:
JAKE	I can shoot you in the foot.
EMMETT	Bu111i11SHIT. Jake SIGHS -- bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment, he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:
JAKE	You told me your daddy's all you got left. Want me to save his ass? Then park yours right there on the ground, you little shit. Got me? Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.
EMMETT	Yeah. I gotcha. Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:
ELLA	Stay with the kid, Happy. The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs
JAKE	I'll get your father back. Bastard still owes me fifty dollars. The hint of a SMIRK... long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK. Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount Â»p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE
JAKE (CONT'D)	You'll be ready? Grey Wolf NODS. Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn. And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him. This plays just between the two of them:
ELLA	That's a nice thing... what you said to the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say you got yourself a sweet side. She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:
JAKE	There's nothin' sweet about me. I told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care about is killin' that thing. And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:
ELLA	I don't believe that.
JAKE	Well believe it. I was playing a part. Just like you were. He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the
THE WOMAN (SUBTITLE)	What are you doing? Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman: Need it to save Nat. And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now:
THE WOMAN	Is he okay?
DOLARHYDE	He's gonna be. A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to him... and TOUCHES his face. And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	I won't let anything happen to him, Jenny. Come back to me. With that, he's GONE with the gold. Leaving her full of DREAD. Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks and push through the water... creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado:
JAKE	You and Percy're brothers, huh?
NAT COLORADO	... half.
JAKE	So... your momma and Dolarhyde---
NAT COLORADO	We friends now? Last I checked, you shot my ear off.
JAKE	Want it back? Colorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake... its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to move on. One of them looks up... .. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon: BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of
HUNT	One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with! Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns
BRONC	The hell you want?
DOLARHYDE	It's about what you want. He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	Lonergan stole your gold. That's a taste of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen. It's all yours if you help me get my boy back. The men trade LOOKS. Bronc eyes the coin. Alight with greed:
BRONC	Who's got your boy?
DOLARHYDE	Well, there's the rub. I got two. Off that -- Doc cracks off a piece. POCKETS it. Shrugs:
DOC	In case we live through this. They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into...
THE WATER GROTTO	Where our TOWNSPEOPLE were hanging. Now, GONE. Around the corner, the sound of ENGINES POWERING UP... A TRANSPORT. A dozen WORKER-BEE ALIENS try to corral the HORSES from the pen -- cruelly jabbing the animals with ALIEN CATTLE
JAKE	We're never gonna get close to that ship. Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER behind them. Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike: Our people TURN... the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches, SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout! The indian SCREAMS --
JAKE	Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache. ALERTED, the dozen aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!
NAT COLORADO	C g_that shuttle. Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK -- Jake meets his eyes:
JAKE	Knew there was a good reason I didn't kill you.
NAT COLORADO	Just thinkin' the same thing. The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS... then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM -- The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS. The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern -- And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run, for the transport -- up the loading ramp:
ELLA	Jake - -
JAKE.	She slaps open an ENGINEERING HATCH, drops down a LADDER. He graphics. She slides into a SEAT --
ELLA	Strap in. dammit!!!
JAKE	Into what?!? Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the sensation of ELLQU as: As a HORSE streaks by, Colorado grabs a hunk of mane, LEAPS ON --
LET'S GO!!!	DOC comes RUNNING frantically: Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back -- no easy task horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel -- Two aliens jump on MANTA-SPEEDERS in pursuit! Jake has NEVER moved this fast, BARELY avoiding walls as Ella
ELLA	Hold on. She cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward -- The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD. As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us:
THE ALIEN SCOUT	-SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE.
JAKE	Sheee-it. SWINGING CLOSED to trap them! But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow
DOC	They're gaining on us!
NAT COLORADO	That's the point! And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS... BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING! A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH! An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY! The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP: The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER. A DOZEN
ELLA JAKE	-- Dammit --- -- what--? -- she's CLIMBING back up the ladder, he FOLLOWS:
ELLA	Engines are warming up -- got eight minutes til the ship leaves, and about one til automated retrieval --
JAKE	-- autojamated what --? The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off. Ella jams her SHOTGUN into a sheath on her back, presses herself flat:
ELLA	Hug the wall. Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --
ELLA (CONT'D)	When they come at us, aim for their heads. Only way to kill 'em for sure. He looks at his bracelet, adrenaline SURGING -- it ACTIVATES:
JAKE	I'll aim just fine. THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:
JAKE (CONT'D)	SonofaBITCH! The manipulator arms SCOOP UP COCOONS, pulling them DOWN the
C'MON!	She JUMPS through the airlock -- Jake has no time to think: And JUMPS after her -- growing SMALLER in what we now reveal is a MASSIVE HANGAR where: AUTOMATED -ARMS PLANT RECENT ARRIVALS INTO A VERITABLE FOREST of Jake picks himself up, looking around the massive hangar in AWE. -- she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:
ELLA (CONT'D)	We can't let that thing see us or they'll know we're here. She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP
ELLA (CONT'D)	This'll take us to the bridge -- But Jake doesn't follow. STARES at her --
JAKE	Slaver's up there--?
ELLA	I sure as hell hope not.
JAKE	Then I'm not goin' with you. And now she HARDENS --
ELLA	You got any idea how big this ship is? No ray you'll ever find him alone. Be like findin' a needle in a-- -- SLAM!! Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER
JAKE	I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find me.
ELLA	Thanks for the head start. She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the
JAKE	Alright, you sonofabitch... come and get me. THE SLAVER fills with RAGE. And RECOGNITION. Aliens begin grabbing WEAPONS but The Slaver SHRIEKS for them to STOP. We don't need to speak alien to understand: "He's mine. " A STEEL BARRICADE SLAMS DOWN BEHIND HIM. WHAM! Another in front -- WHAM! He's TRAPPED, shut off from the passageways... ON JAKE. Understanding... his call is bging answe Okay. And starts walking to the elevator... as a SCREAM takes us to:
DOC	I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and splint that leg! We're losing ranks ! ! ! And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols fills the air as -- DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks:
NAT COLORADO	You came back!
DOLARHYDE	Told you: I take care of my kin. Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as: A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming: THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction. CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM! The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER exploding, but if he pulls his finger out... HE DIES TOO. slows to a STOP. The door cycles open and -- -- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees: Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up along with it all. A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage. fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY. A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons... Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
JAKE	Drop the woman. We both know this ain't about her. But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
JAKE (CONT'D)	She says you're as bad as they come. Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:
JAKE (CONT'D)	Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say the same about me. A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS.
JAKE (CONT'D)	Could'a had your boys kill me five times over, instead you rolled out the red carpet... so let's get it over with. The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile. THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching. JAKE -- his hand is still. Everyone DRAWS! But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee the captor with a SHOT to the temple -- Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner: Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.
JAKE	Stay down. Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a turbine HOWL. Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner... Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded -- -- you alright? In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:
ELLA	Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead... Get me over to that turbolift. He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her to the elevator --
ELLA (CONT'D)	Put me inside. He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL:
ELLA (CONT'D)	I can manage the rest without you. Go do what you came up here to do. He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR. And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:
JAKE	Goddamnit. -- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control
JAKE (CONT'D)	Stop smiling. -- KATHWAM! An EXPLOSION throws them off their horses. Colorado picks up his father and they start RUNNING LOW under Doc's finger is still STUCK in that ALIEN GRENADE, clamped to the bleeding Apache's shoulder:
DOL.ARHYDE (CONT'D)	The hell iz that? Grey Wolf MOANS in pain. Doc SHOUTS to Dolar:
DOC	Tell him to hold still! If I have this thing figured right, long as t keep my finger under the red pin we won't blow up! What's he saying?:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)	He says we're all gonna die.
COLORADO	We need to pull it out of his shoulder!
DOLARHYDE	I'm not pullin' anything! He's the damn doctor! Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:
DOLARHYDE	Alright, listen -- you slide your finger from under that pin, I'll slip mine in and hold it in place. Then you pull it out and I'll throw it. Doc NODS fearfully. Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out. Grey Wolf braces
DOC	On three... One... t --
DOLARHYDE	-- Wait. Everyone LURCHES from the tension interrupt:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	Tell your wife we're clear.
DOC	What?
DOLARHYDE	-- your wife. Maria. We had an arrangement. I left your saloon alone and she paid me off. ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused --
DOC	We're broke. Paid you off with what?
DOLARHYDE	She stole from the people in your morgue. Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches -- It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.
DOC	I thought she was cheating!
DOLARHYDE	Just robbin' corpses.
DOC	Thank God! Wait. You hate me. Why're you telling me this? With GENUINE REMORSE:
DOLARHYDE	May not get another chance -- -- and I still hate ya. A MOMENT. Forgiveness and atonement.
DOC AND DOLARHYDE	One... two... three! And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS, Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:
DOLARHYDE	Tell your mother I love her. With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos -- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through Dolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!! IT DETONATES IN A But his sacrifice 7M S THE TIDE! THE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE back in DISORDER -- and Ella mans a console, getting to work --
ELLA	We're going down fast. She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way: QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:
JAKE	No matter what. Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below. MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY -- A MONSTROUS SHADOW spreads over the battlefield. Everyone looks Fall back!!! NOW!! NOW!! Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS and looks down to see --
JAKE	Go to hell. CLIMBING a ladder back to the upper deck -- But find themselves SMASHING into the ENORMOUS HULL of the ship as_it crashe _down!
ELLA	I lied.
JAKE	... I know.
ELLA	No, I heard what you said when I was layin' there... JAKE. Taken aback. LAID BARE. As she says:
ELLA (CONT'D)	You are a good man. At least... to me. The ground GROWS BIGGER out the window. Her HAND reaches over comes... EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his shoulder. Among other faces, White and Apache... all of them From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING UP. White and Kiowa-Apache ABDUCTEES. DOC RUSHES IN, searching faces -- no -- no -- no -- n-- tears runs down her cheek. He EMBRACES her madly, kissing every inch of her face as... EMMETT pushes through the crowd, sees SHERIFF TAGGART --
PAW!!!! PAW!!!!	The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart It's me -- it's Emmett. And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's eyes... Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father Families, lovers, friends... reunited.
COLORADO	Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of
A VOICE (O.S.)	Nat? Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a dream. Sees his father on the ground...
PERCY	What... happened? And all Colorado can say is...
NAT COLORADO	He's dead. That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then --
PERCY	Who's gettin' the ranch? ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY: Colorado WHIRLS -- DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	No one's gettin' my ranch. Stunned, Colorado GRINS. Percy spits blood, points accusingly --
PERCY	Paw, he-- Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face: OW!!! What'd you do that for?
UOLARHYUE	For being an ungrateful little bastard. Now shake your brother's hand and thank him for saving your ass, cause it's more than you ever would'a done bjM. Chastened, Percy glowers at Colorado. Grudgingly reaches out a hand. So does Nat. As they SHAKE --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	That's better.
JAKE	Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But
JAKE	. what is it?
ELLA	We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft. That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon. We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd... We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
EMMETT	-- what? What'd I dQ?
SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT	Get outta the road before you're run down! If your (overlapping) momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the street she'd roll over in her grave and shoot lightnin' bolts outta her eyes," I know, I know! He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS:
SHERIFF TAGGART	Kid's got a mouth on him.
DEPUTY WADE	Well, Kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it. Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:
SHERIFF TAGGART	Woodrow.
DOLARHYDE	Kyle. Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)	Go_ _on. Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --
SHERIFF TAGGART	What's this?
DOLARHYDE	Claims to the land 50 miles west of here. I've signed it over to the township of Absolution. Considering I'm a businessman, I figure expansion's in both our interests. Needs the Sheriff's signature to be official.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, Woodrow. That so. With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:
SHERIFF TAGGART	What's this about twenty percent going to the Apaches? Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:
DOLARHYDE	Figure the only way not to piss 'em off is to buy 'em.
SHERIFF TAGGART	Since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off?
DOLARHYDE	Just sign it, Goddamnit. With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
SHERIFF TAGGART	I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow, but I know you'd just be insulted.
DOLARHYDE	Damn right. Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
DOC MARIA	SHH! The workers will hear us!!! Let them hear! As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.
DOC	What is this?
MARIA	Look at the inscription. He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:
DOC	This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...
MARIA	Shut up and kiss me. She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME -- Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
ELLA	Second damn time that dog ran off on me.
JAKE	Second time he brought me to you. Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it -- glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
JAKE (CONT'D)	Looks like you got everything set. Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly
ELLA	Where you headed? Got some messes to clean up. But she looks at him. fEADI.NG liim. wryly:
ELLA	Messes.
JAKE	... Yep. What. She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:
ELLA	I think you're ridin' off cause you're just scared of what'll happen if you stay. An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:
JAKE	And what's gonna happen? She steps CLOSER to him... INTIMATE:
ELLA	You know. A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS... But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:
JAKE	If I stay... it's not gonna be good for anybody, Ella. A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:
ELLA	Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird noises at night. Cattle mutilations. Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down there. Give it a look-see.
JAKE	What's 'phenomena'?
ELLA	Big storms in places that don't get big storms. ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED, though he plays it down:
JAKE	You goin' down there yourself?
ELLA	Why? You worried about me? You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--
JAKE	No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself just fine. Be seein' you around.
ELLA	goodbye, Jake. He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't be an idiot." Jake glances over --
JAKE	Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt. Go on, GET. He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE. Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end... But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around. between them. Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:
JAKE (CONT'D)	Abilene happens to be on my way. He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:
JAKE (CONT'D)	Stop smiling, Goddammit. He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see... Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset... Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.
FADE OUT.
