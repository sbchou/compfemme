CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO	We are the secret of the Universe.
RESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES	Bi-la kaifa.
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO	We are the secret of the Universe. We know of spice...the spice called melange...the greatest treasure in the Universe. It exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis, Dune. We know of spice and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will awaken.
RESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES	Bi-la kaifa.
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO	And now the prophecy...
REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D)	He will come...the voice from the outer world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad, which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness. He will have been born of a Bene Gesserit mother. The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ
IRULAN	Father. EMPEROR Irulan. uniform, thinking.
EMPEROR	A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
REVEREND MOTHER	We felt his presence.
EMPEROR	I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
REVEREND MOTHER	Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
EMPEROR	Yes?
REVEREND MOTHER	Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
EMPEROR	He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
REVEREND MOTHER	I am your Truthsayer, my lord... He is here, my lord.
TANKED GUILDSMEN #1	The Bene Gesserit witch must leave. The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother.
EMPEROR	Leave us.
REVEREND MOTHER	Yes, my Lord.
EMPEROR	We are alone... twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty, chemical spills dripping from under the tank. tank translates into English and broadcasts it into
NAVIGATOR	We have just folded space from Ix...
EMPEROR	Yes?... How was your journey?
NAVIGATOR	Many machines on Ix... new machines.
EMPEROR	Oh yes? NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
EMPEROR	Is there a problem?... Usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit.
NAVIGATOR	The answer is within the problem... but a much different language version which is fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song monologue.
NAVIGATOR	I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
EMPEROR	Yes.
NAVIGATOR	You must share with us. EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
NAVIGATOR	So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
EMPEROR	Yes.
NAVIGATOR	Reverend Mother... I will give you the Tleilaxu Path.
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)	A chance for escape? But for whom?
EMPEROR	Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
NAVIGATOR	LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)	He shouldn't speak of this...
NAVIGATOR	...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond...to have superior powers... Our power to fold space is in the spice... Without us, your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets... You would be lost.
EMPEROR	I can assure you...
NAVIGATOR	Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)	Here it comes...
NAVIGATOR	We ourselves... foresee a slight problem within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul Atreides.
EMPEROR	You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides... his father.
PAUL	Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond...
PAUL (V.O.)	... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.
PAUL	It does look dry.... Arrakeen Valley. Each day the palms along the outer wall of the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one hundred men. The palms were placed by the Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in front of the city Fremen.
PAUL	Where are the Harkonnens from here?
PAUL (V.O.)	There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen... the enemy. this.
PAUL	I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back to the door.
PAUL (CONT'D)	I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
THUFIR	Those sounds could be imitated.
PAUL	I'd know the difference. THUFIR Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
PAUL	My father sent you to test me. Music then?
GURNEY	No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
PAUL	Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
GURNEY	Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
PAUL	I'm sorry Gurney.
GURNEY	Not sorry enough.
GURNEY	Guard yourself for true!
PAUL	What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly right at Gurney's neck.
PAUL	Is this what you seek?
GURNEY	Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
GURNEY (CONT'D)	We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
PAUL	Would you really have drawn my blood?
GURNEY	If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
PAUL	Things have been so serious here lately.
GURNEY	Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
PAUL	Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis? DR. YUEH I have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen... only 125 meters long.
PAUL	Only?!
DR. YUEH	There are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert -- far from where we'll be in Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden.... Why?
PAUL	The storms and the worms. Is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour?
YUEH	It can render flesh to dust in minutes. And these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere. Our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on Arrakis.
PAUL	Well, how do the Fremen survive there?
YUEH	We don't know much about the Fremen... They live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes...
PAUL	The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways?
THUFIR	Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
PAUL	The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
THUFIR (CONT'D)	Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
PAUL	I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going?
THUFIR	We have our new army. Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
THUFIR (CONT'D)	Clear and lock the room.
THUFIR (CONT'D)	Activate a fighter.
GURNEY	Precise control....
PAUL	The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen?
PAUL	Duncan!
DUNCAN	Paul. I was on my way to say goodbye to you. I have to go on ahead.
PAUL	Why? I wish you were coming with us.
DUNCAN	It's something for your father. He wants to talk to you. I'll see you in Arrakis. May the hand of God be with you.
PAUL	May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.
PAUL	Father.
DUKE LETO	Thank you for joining me, Paul. It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us.
DUKE LETO (CONT'D)	My son. Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations.... He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same.... It makes me feel very proud...
PAUL	I want you to be proud of me.
DUKE LETO	I'll miss the sea... but a person needs new experiences... they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow. Without change, something sleeps inside us... and seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken. PAUL Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet... moving... moving.
PAUL (V.O.)	Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.
VOICE	The second moon, your moon...
BEAUTIFUL GIRL	Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

PAUL	Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet... moving... moving. the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway looking at him.
REVEREND MOTHER	We'll salvage what we can... but I can tell you.. dear God... for the father... nothing.
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)	Did you really think that you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!
REVEREND MOTHER	My greatest student... and my greatest disappointment.... He's awake!... He's listening to us. Good... Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides... I want to see you in your mother's chamber in one quarter of an hour.
JESSICA	Paul?... This is very important...
PAUL	Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father... nothing? REVEREND MOTHER Jessica... You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides... Jessica!
JESSICA	It meant so much to him...
REVEREND MOTHER	You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?... Desires don't figure in this! An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We may lose both blood lines now.
JESSICA	I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll pay for my own mistakes.
REVEREND MOTHER	And your son will pay with you.
JESSICA	Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... Please... REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
JESSICA	Your Reverence.
PAUL	What does she fear? What about my Father?
JESSICA	Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you. strange, yet subtle.
REVEREND MOTHER	Now you come here.
PAUL	She's using The Voice. No.
REVEREND MOTHER	Some strength there. Surprising! Come here.
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)	See this... Put your right hand in the box. PAUL What's in the box?
REVEREND MOTHER	Pain.
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)	STOP! Put your hand in the box.
PAUL	The Voice again.
REVEREND MOTHER	I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
PAUL	Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
REVEREND MOTHER	Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
PAUL	It burns.
REVEREND MOTHER	SILENCE... SILENCE.
PAUL	I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her
REVEREND MOTHER	You feel the flesh crisping?
REVEREND MOTHER	Flesh dropping off.
PAUL	THE PAIN!
REVEREND MOTHER	NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)	Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
PAUL	I see the truth of it. REVEREND MOTHER Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control? You know when people speak the truth?
PAUL	I know it. muffled voice say "Tell me of your homeworld, Usul".
REVEREND MOTHER	Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
PAUL	Not all of them... I know which ones will.
REVEREND MOTHER	Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
PAUL	What is it?
REVEREND MOTHER	The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
PAUL	Where?
REVEREND MOTHER	Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
PAUL	I have heard of it. REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
PAUL	Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER	They tried and died.... Jessica!
REVEREND MOTHER	I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
PAUL	I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
JESSICA	Paul!

BARON	What does Leto say, Piter?
PITER	He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
BARON	I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
PITER	As you instructed me, I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t... BARON My plan!
PITER	The plan to crush the Atreides. Feyd, Rabban... go quietly... no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron. The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor.

BARON	I won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack. However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom.

JESSICA	So many reminders of the scarcity of water.
DR. YUEH	Have you noticed the line of palms along the wall... the Harkonnen put them in... to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people.... Each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men.
JESSICA	The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them.
DR. YUEH	My wife... you didn't know my wife... they... JESSICA Forgive me... ... His wife was Bene Gesserit too... the signs are al over him.... They must have killed here.

The city of Arrakeen is under martial law... we have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors six through ten. The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and we have some on the airfield. Our new army is still training, but everything is shielded.... With the shielding, we are impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire, for your inspection of spice mining operations, but since the attempt of the young master, I am against your leaving the Palace.
DUKE LETO	The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives have already been taken. We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all know what to do. ...Gurney! We desperately need more spice miners... many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle. We need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men ... any with open sand experience. You must persuade them to enlist with us. GURNEY They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup as the east wind. And they shall gather the captivity of the sand.
DUKE LETO	Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive. We will not be prisoners here in this place.
GURNEY	Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work.
JESSICA	I must speak with you Leto!
JESSICA	Yes?
SHADOUT MAPES	I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper, Noble Born. What are your orders.
JESSICA	You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto -- mother of the heir designate.... "Shadout"... that's an ancient word.
MAPES	You know the ancient tongues?
JESSICA	I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
MAPES	As the legend says.
JESSICA	That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
JESSICA (CONT'D)	I know many things. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice. MAPES My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one.
JESSICA	And the means of my death should I prove otherwise. Now we will see which way the decision tips.
MAPES	Do you know this my lady?
JESSICA	It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.
MAPES	Say it not lightly... Do you know its meaning?
JESSICA	Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. It's a maker...
JESSICA (CONT'D)	Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
MAPES	My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock. JESSICA There's more here... yes! Mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded.

KYNES	So, this is Leto the Just...
GURNEY	I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
KYNES	Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
DUKE LETO	So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
KYNES	I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
DUKE LETO	This is my son, Paul.
PAUL	Are you a Fremen?
KYNES	I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
PAUL	He's hiding something.
DUKE LETO	I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
KYNES	They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
PAUL	"Your gift is a blessing of the river."
KYNES	The Mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing. Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With your permission, I will check the security of your suits.
GURNEY	The Duke is to be addresses as... Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit,

PAUL	No.
KYNES	Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?

PAUL	Will we see a worm?
KYNES	Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
PAUL	Always?
KYNES	Always.
PAUL	Why do they come?
KYNES	To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. PAUL I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things. Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
GURNEY	The young master is a trained Mentat, an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe.
KYNES	As I said... they defend the spice sands. As to their relationship with the spice... who knows.
GURNEY	Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
KYNES	That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.

KYNES	Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign!

GURNEY	Don't mention the Duke... This is an uncoded channel.
KYNES	Unlisted flight northeast of you... wormsign on intercept course... estimated contact fifteen minutes.
VOICE	Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix. Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very precise estimate. Who is on that unlisted flight?
DUKE LETO	What happens now?
KYNES	The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE... harvester.
KYNES	They'll work until the very last minute.
VOICE	Spotter control... no sign of the carryall... it isn't answering.
GURNEY	The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.
VOICE	Spotter control -- give me a report by the numbers.
DUKE LETO	Damn it... Harkonnens.
DUKE LETO (CONT'D)	We are coming down to take you off the harvester... All spotters are ordered to comply.
VOICE	Ordered by whom? DUKE LETO Duke Leto Atreides....
VOICE	Yes... yes, Sire!
DUKE LETO	How many men do you have?
VOICE	Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire, we can't leave this spice...
DUKE LETO	Damn the spice! Get out of there. noise. No one is coming out.
DUKE LETO	Two men in each of the spotters... You!... over here... run!!
KYNES	I can't see him yet but he's very close... DUKE LETO Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy.
GURNEY	Come on boys... come on. We're going to be heavy, Sire.
KYNES	Here he is... We've got to go.
PAUL	Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
KYNES	Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him. May his passage cleanse the world.
DUKE LETO	What's that you're saying?
KYNES	Nothing. SPICE MINER #1 Liet!
SPICE MINER #2	Shhhhh.
PAUL	Liet?
KYNES	You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch! Watch!
GURNEY	Gods, what a monster.
DUKE LETO	Someone is going to pay for this... I promise.
KYNES	This Duke is more concerned over his men than the spice! I must admit... against all better judgement... I like this Duke.
DUKE LETO	Duncan! What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me. Why haven't we heard from you?
DUNCAN	My lord... I suspect so much. I think they are the allies we seek... they are strong and fierce... they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly.... As you know, the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen. Everyone thinks that there are but few -- wandering here and there in the desert.... My lord, I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet... that the Fremen exist in vast numbers... vast numbers... and it is they that control Arrakis.
DUKE LETO'S VOICE	Guard. Open the door.
DUKE LETO	Sleep well... my son. lift himself to call out.

DUKE LETO (CONT'D)	Yueh! He's sabotaged the house generators, we're wide open.
YUEH	I've brought House Atreides down. I've destroyed the new army's weirding modules.
DUKE LETO	... Why? YUEH I wish to kill a man... not you, my dear Duke, but the Baron.... You were dead already... but you will be close to the Baron before you die. You will be tied and drugged but you can still attack. When you see the Baron you will have a new poison tooth. He will want you close so he can gloat over you. One bite on this tooth and a strong exile...
DUKE LETO	Refuse...
YUEH	No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will save the lives of your Paul and Jessica. For Paul...

The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us. Arrakis will become the center of the Universe. The dream unfolds.
PAUL	The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret. With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it. Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my father's armies were never able to fully develop this new form. This is what I will teach you. You will be the fiercest and most feared fighters in the Universe. understand rhythm like this but you do not yet understand the rhythm of the higher sounds, sounds that heal and build... sounds that destroy.

Through sound and motion you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs.... We will kill until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

PAUL	To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.
STILGAR	Sayyadina. Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest. She asks that you pass within.
JESSICA	They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. I will try to pass within.
STILGAR	Death may be the result.... Are you sure?
JESSICA	I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?

BARON	Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your heart plug already.... Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here. But this is not why we're here. We've brought you a little cat, Thufir. You must care for it if you wish to live. A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat. By milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote... it must be done each day.... Also, you must do something for me if you wish to live.
