Jack's Lament	Performed by Danny Elfman my talents are renowned far and wide it comes to surprises in the moonlit night the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms have seen grown men give out a shriek the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan have swept the very bravest off their feet I grow so weary of the sound of screams I, Jack, the Pumpkin King grown so tired of the same old thing emptiness began to grow something out there, far from my home longing that I've never known I'll scare you right out of your pants a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky I'm known throughout England and France recite Shakespearean quotations animal nor man can scream like I can the fury of my recitations
who here would ever understand	the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin tire of his crown, if they only understood give it all up if he only could calls out for something unknown fame and praise come year after year nothing for these empty tears

Town Meeting Song	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast
	are objects so peculiar were not to be believed around, things to tantalize my brain a world unlike anything I've ever seen as hard as I try can't seem to describe a most improbable dream you must believe when I tell you this as real as my skull and it does exist let me show you
is a thing called a present	whole thing starts with a box
	box? it steel?
	there locks?
DEMON	it filled with a pox?
WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON	pox delightful, a pox
	you please a box with bright-colored paper the whole thing's topped with a bow
	bow? why? in it? in it?
	the point of the thing, not to know
	a bat it bend?
UNDER THE STAIRS	a rat it break?
GAL	it s the head that I found in the lake
	now, you don't understand not the point of Christmas land
pay attention	pick up an oversized sock hang it like this on the wall
HYDE	yes! Does it still have a foot?
MR. HYDE	me see, let me look
MR. HYDE	it rotted and covered with gook?
	let me explain no foot inside, but there's candy sometimes it's filled with small toys
AND WINGED DEMON	toys
DEMON	they bite?
	they snap?
DEMON	explode in a sack?
KID	perhaps they just spring out scare girls and boys
	a splendid idea Christmas sounds fun fully endorse it try it at once
	something here that you don't quite grasp I may as well give them what they want the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last the ruler of this Christmas land a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice that's what I've come to understand
I've also heard it told	he's something to behold a lobster, huge and red he sets out to slay with his rain gear on bulging sacks with his big great arms is, so I've heard it said full moonlight flies into a fog a vulture in the sky they call him Sandy Claws
at least they're excited	they don't understand special kind of feeling in Christmas land well...
	got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.
FINKELSTEIN	poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl.
FINKELSTEIN	my head...the door is open.
	
FINKELSTEIN	Skellington, up here my boy.
	I need to borrow some equipment.

	time is buzzing in my skull it let me be? I cannot tell so many things I cannot grasp I think I've got it, and then at last my bony fingers it does slip a snowflake in a fiery grip
here I'm not quite getting	I try, I keep forgetting a memory long since past in an instant, gone in a flash does it mean? does it mean?
these little bric-a-brac	secret's waiting to be cracked dolls and toys confuse me so it all, I love it though something's hidden through a door I do not have the key there I cannot see does it mean? does it mean? does it mean? know the stories and I know the rhymes know the Christmas carols all by heart skull's so full, it's tearing me apart often as I've read them, something's wrong hard to put my bony finger on I've been led to think I trying much too hard? course! I've been too close to see answer's right in front of me in front of me music drifting in the air but everywhere because I cannot see it mean I can't believe it not as tricky as it seems why should they have all the fun? should belong to anyone
anyone, in fact, but me	I could make a Christmas tree there's no reason I can find couldn't handle Christmas time
bet I could improve it too	that's exactly what I'll do
