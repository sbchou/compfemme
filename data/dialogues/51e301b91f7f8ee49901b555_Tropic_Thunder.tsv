JULIE	Well, it might look like 1969 here in the tiny Southeast Asian country of Bien Den Phu, but it is 2007, and they are making history. We are here with an E! exclusive, the first look behind the scenes at what Hollywood insiders are calling the most expensive war movie ever produced. It's called "Tropic Thunder", and first time Director Damien Dorfman has assembled an all-star cast to play the forgotten grunts who perished near here more than 35 years ago. Tropic Thunder 16. Heading up the ensemble, the highest grossing action star of all time, Chris Michael Speedman... d I But the last few films have-not "blown up" for Speedntan as he's struggled to broaden his range as an.-actor.. First, an attempt to change gears with a comedy... in that uptight-white-guy/loose-cannon-black-guy action comedy style. The disappointing "CHITLIN AND THE DUDE", was followed.with last year's failed venture into serious dramatic territory...
JULIE (V.0.)	."Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally impaired farm hand who can "talk" to animals was a box office disaster that many critics called one of the worst movies of all time.
SPEEDMAN	You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy.
JULIE	But now, the question is can Speedman "mu- mu-make" audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in "Tropic Thunder". And,' possibly a shot â 1. -4416
SPEEDMAN	All I want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud. It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That's why we're here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what he-- what you --went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying When I lost these... It was as if I saw through these for the first time..'. And it was only then that I really began to use these...
SPEEDMAN	That's great. He's like a... Buddha or something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it ,Tropic Thunder 18.
JULIE	Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time? Maybe you should rub Kirk Lazarus's belly! He already has three! Speedman laughs uncomfortably, trying to seem unperturbed. i "I' 0, nM y

SERIES OF SHOTS OF DAMIEN DORFMAN	Getting awards, shooting documentary footage in SIERRA
JULIE (V.0.)	British documentary director Damien Dorfman has never made a theatrical movie before, but his mission, he says, is to bring a reality to the film that he feels is missing from most Hollywood epics.
DAMIEN	My goal, quite simply, is for an audience member to walk out of the cinema, feeling as if they were IN Vietnam for two hours. Quite literally.
REPORTER	Are you intimidated about working with actors for the first time?
DAMIEN	Intimidated? Tropic Thunder 20. Not really, mate. I tell you what's intimidating. Filming a seven-foot Hutu warrior who is readylto shove his machete up your ass if you look at him cockeyed. That's intimidating. I think I ban handle actors of the unarmed variety.
JULIE (V.0.,)	Well, he'll certainly have his hands full with king of comedy Jeff Portnoy.

REDYKULOUS	As far as Redykulous is concerned, you .know, I 'always believed you've got to exploit every opportunity. He holds up a can of "PYMP SWEAT".
REDYKULOUS	That's why my new sports drink Pymp Sweat is the official beverage on the set of Tropic Thunder, as well as my new energy bar, the "Bust-A-Nut", with all proceeds going to clean up land mines in this previously war ravaged area.
JULIE	At a reported budget north of $200 million, Tropic Thunder could end up costing almost as much as the real war! But the good news for Damien Dorfman and his troops -- the Oscar buzz is already starting! So for El News I'm Julie-- All of a sudden Portnoy, wearing a Tropic Thunder cap all
PORTNOY	Me so horny!! Me so horny!! He jumps into the pool with her! What a crack up!

DAMIEN	You can't do that Todd.
VOICE OF TODD I	Yes we can.. The dailies are not good.
DAMIEN	Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good movie! Isn't that what they say?
VOICE OF TODD	I never heard that saying. Look, Damien. Fact: You're. three weeks behind and you've been shooting for five days. Fact: we greenlit this project at a very specific number, a number Walter and I could get in bed. with, and fact--.
DAMIEN ,. _.	Todd, it really isn't necessary for you to,keep saying "fact" before everything. It's kind of implied, that if you are saying.it--
VOICE OF TODD	Alright.. I'm just.trying to keep the emotion out of it, so I thought I would say."fact" before each fact, so it would be less-upsetting -- I
VOICE OF WALTER	Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I'm just gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds like the inmates are running the asylum.
DAMIEN	Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that .these actors are--

DAMIEN	Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi--
SPEEDMAN	Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I
DAMIEN'	Right. well those things... those. 4, things ...I'm dealing with bigger issues right now Chris --
SPEEDMAN	Yeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.

SPEEDMAN	Rick?.
PECK.	Guess what I'm staring at right now?
SPEEDMAN	What?
PECK	I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly pandas from cuteville. It's insane.
I	Tropic Thunder 25. We see Pedk is holding a Vanity Fair with an ad on the
PECK	The credibility factor that the pandas give you is priceless, and strangely, if' you see this picture, what really strikes me is the credibility that you give them. I've been getting psychotic feedback all day. Hey did you get the basket I sent? WE SEE: A survival-themed gift basket in a camouflage sunblock, etc.
SPEEDMAN	Yeah. Thanks.
PECK	You sad? What's wrong?
SPEEDMAN	No I'm fine. I've just been having a tough time over here. They still havn't got the TiVo hooked up and... I don't know... Lazarus is getting all this Oscar buzz already --
PECK	Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk Lazarus goes and places his entire body in some experimental Malaysian dipping sauce so he can actually be black, of course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to what I am telling you. He is clinically mentally not right.
SPEEDMAN	Yeah but the way they talk about him. I mean, he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't even get a nomination. I don't know, I mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my "Elf" but with Oscars. Those were your exact words. Tropic Thunder 26.
PECK	I don't believe those were my exact words but let's get beyond that to the root of this. Remember the moment you chose to do, this', and I wanted you to do the ESP robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen? And I said stay home be happy and you said "no, Rick I need to play a real human being" and I said "okay" and then I said "are you sure?" and you said that you needed this-for your soul?
SPEEDMAN	Yes but --
PECK	Which I totally respected and now you're doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move on me,..which I love by the-way-- but-you said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul And-that's why I hate you.. Because you were RIGHT. And you're in. the Phuc Long fucking Delta,. in the real mud, with- leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil es from Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would wager, forcing everyone around you to rise to your level. Am I right? I mean you are over there forcing a bunch of PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and. become a platoon. And it hurts. Am I right? Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this
SPEEDMAN	Yeah. You are right.
PECK	Alright, that's what.I thought. Now get to work genius soldier. I'll handle the .TiVo. Peck hangs up abruptly.

SANDUSKY	I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn?
PORTNOY	Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that grip with the bandana?
SANDUSKY	Uh, no. I think-- But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug
SANDUSKY	Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it. You actually care, don't you?
SANDUSKY	Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you.
DAMIEN	You're the only one who auditioned. You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky.
SANDUSKY	Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond? Yes, that was the point. Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it. Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a r Tropic Thunder 30.
SPEEDMAN	I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them... watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did.
LAZARUS	Huh, I always found mere observation a little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it.
SPEEDMAN	Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life.. Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be... .NOT retarded.
LAZARUS	Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost:
SPEEDMAN	About what?
LAZARUS	Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded!
SPEEDMAN	How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.
LAZARUS	Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man. Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT retarded. He could count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT retarded. HANKS'. Forest Gump. Slow? Yes. Tropic Thunder 31. Retarded? Maybe. Had braces on his legs, he charmed the pants bff Nixon, and won a ping-pong competition. Peter Sellers, "Being There", infantile? Yes. Retarded? No. He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder.
LAZARUS	You went full retard, man. You never go 14 full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard. Went home empty handed. Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be so stupid?
LAZARUS	But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose the hook hands though... cripples don't give the Academy wood either. Oh. Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high
DAMIEN	Redykulous... I need to talk to you.

DAMIEN	Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the cameras. you understand?. Away from them...
REDYKULOUS	No.
DAMIEN	What?
REDYKULOUS	No. I can't do that. If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people don't get to see the real Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly Redykulous".
DAMIEN	Well this is about work ...my show so to. .speak. Do you understand?
REDYKULOUS	I guess. But not really. Your show and my show are the same thing. This is gonna help your show, trust me. Tropic Thunder 33.

That's a quote from my children's book, "The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of." I know it's just a book for. kids, but I think it applies to.making a movie as well. 'Course... I know a lot of the reason things are maybe messed up is ME. The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad.

FOUR LEAF	If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown... but...if... He...lives in the...water, for many years, he will.. .grow gills ... . do you understand? He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both
DAMIEN	I want to!!! But not really!! Someone's an ANT? Or something???
FOUR LEAF	I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me!! My boys were worse pussies than these guys. But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in the
SHIT.	He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his cigarette...
FOUR LEAF	There's a place. About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his Tropic Thunder 36.
DAMIEN	And...?
FOUR LEAF	Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as
FOUR LEAF	You must put them.under your thumb the way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR control.
DAMIEN	I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my total control... finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty. Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers...
FOUR LEAF	Yes... yes...
DAMIEN	Put them in the real shit. Film them with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR!
YES!!	Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP Tropic Thunder 37.
IN THE CHOPPER	Cody is piloting. Damien and Four Leaf are in the back We move across the faces of the actors, all in brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent So, uh, any idea how long we'll be gone? Because I left most of my... vitamins back at the hotel. The other actors chime in with similar concerns, regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities, etc... '
FOUR LEAF	Save your breath, maggots! They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is sprawling onto hire.
DAMIEN	That'sâ¢right. Maggots.
The chopper lands in a small clearing as the sun rises	
IN THE CHOPPER	Damien and Four Leaf, in DI mode, hustle the "grunts" off Apparently they are not moving fast enough -- Four Leaf ground. .Tropic Thunder 38. The group, scared shitless, start falling out of the Four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and motions to
FOUR LEAF	See you in hell! As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts. All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who seems very upset.
PORTNOY	This is bullshit! Damien marches over to him, and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY in
PORTNOY I	
AWAY OUR POSITION TO CHARLIE!!	Silence. Everyone hands over their phones. Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his. Damien dumps them in a pile and finds a large boulder. HE
DAMIEN	Okay, girls... now that I have your attention, I will tell you fuckfaces what we're doing here. You are no longer actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a war. These men around you are your brothers. The guys look at each other, unhappy.
DAMIEN	Congratulations. You've just landed in "the shit". Your objective is to head north and liberate the village at D'ang Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf" gets himself captured, at which point you rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home. We will also be rigging this entire valley of death with hidden cameras so that every glorious moment gets on film. And believe me it WILL be glorious. If it looks real, chances are good it probably is. You wanted to be actors? You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being? Get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole. There's going to be enemy fire. Booby traps. Your own personal little slice of the 'Nam. The group shares a look -- "What's going on?" He pulls out a laminated packet.
DAMIEN	"Four Leaf", since you're the Captain here, here's the scene list and the map. Think you can handle it? From now on, Whatever we get on film is our movie, period. Damien pulls out a walkie-talkie.
DAMIEN	THIS is your only link to, the real world. It will be used only in an emergency or to replenish our supplies if absolutely necessary. This is NOT a cell phone. This radio goes'to the chopper, and the chopper ONLY. The chopper is GOD, and I am Jesus Christ his SONI!! You will' depend on and pray 'to US!! And nobody ï¿½iï¿½ï¿½ i n I' ï¿½IMdï¿½4 Now... let's'put the greatest war movie ever in the can! With that, Damien marches toward the treeline and'steps
HIM TO BITS.	The group stands absolutely stock still for several long
SPEEDMAN	Whoa. One of them grabs a radio: < We have heard an explosion, in the northern sector.>
A UNKNOWN VOICE	They lock and load, heading towards the actors... Tropic Thunder 41.
CODY	So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives us the go ahead, we'ï¿½ust their cherry with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha till they come running right at, us, then a good of fashioned firefight, maintaining our distance. Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle,
CODY	I been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest fans. Your book was kinda my "Catcher in the Rye". It inspired me to become a gyro man. Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic
CODY	I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I never was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal. And you sir, are the real deal. Nothing.
CODY	Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry? Looks to me like a--
FOUR LEAF	I don't know what it's called. I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life. Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.
CODY	Ok, we're ready to rock and roll. Damien, come in. Cameras are up, ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so. Tropic Thunder 42.
PORTNOY	I think he's like... dead.
SPEEDMAN:	Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice, wherever you're hiding!
REDYKULOUS	I don't think he's hiding.. I think he just died! Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse.
SANDUSKY	He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head. He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.
SANDUSKY	Must've been one of those Claymore mines. This old Jungle must.be full of them.,
REDYKUZOUS	You bet your ass it is. That's why a percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin' solve the problem! Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle. Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent
SPEEDMAN	C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of the Nam! He's trying to get in our heads! Tropic Thunder 43.
GUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE	
SPEEDMAN	That whole "life and death" speech in the chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do you think all that "playing God" was about? The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief --
LAZARUS	Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is dead!! Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.
SPEEDMAN	Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor here, but, no offense, I've done a lot mote effects driven event films, and I think I can spot a prop body.
ON THE GUERRILLAS	The LEAD guerilla signals for all his guys to hold their
ON THE ACTORS	Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on Damien's body crackles to life:
CODY (ON WALKIE)	-- I repeat, we are now go for mission! The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up, Alright, can we start the scene now? Or do you need a formal invitation?! Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day. Ambush. Speedman closes his eyes, taking a second to get into
SPEEDMAN	I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats. The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM
SPEEDMAN	I said, I got a baaad feeling on this one, Brooklyn... Oh! He's acting! Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking. Swinging his gun unpredictably.
ON THE GUERILLAS	They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the
SANDUSKY	Me too, cap'n. Hey, cap?: If.I told you something, something kinda personal, you wouldn't think I was crazy, right?
SPEEDMAN	Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy Brooklyn...
SANDUSKY	Well,. if I told you that I, I never actually, well, been with a girl...you wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer .or nothin'... would you.?
SPEEDMAN	.Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a queer. Tropic Thunder 45. Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too:
REDYKULOUS	Sh...sh...shit ...When I get back to the world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it till I broke its back.
PORTNOY	The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind slurpin' on a little of that --
SPEEDMAN	That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't gonna let Charlie... Lazarus can't handle it anymore.
LAZARUS	What the FUCK is wrong with you people?! Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back.
SPEEDMAN	Sorry Damien! Back to one... action! Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta
LAZARUS	Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED! Speedman sighs, annoyed.
SPEEDMAN	How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some of us are taking this seriously. Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he transformation -- Everything except for his skin color
LAZARUS	Jaysus! There isn't going to be any movie, ya gobshite! Tropic Thunder 46. Damien is dead, Speedman. Yes,_the show must go on, but this is feckin' madness.
PORTNOY	Wow. That was really cool.
THE GUERILLAS	Are watching this, poised to attack.
BACK ON THE ACTORS	Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now.
SPEEDMAN	Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped something. He mimes picking something , off, the ground.
SPEEDMAN	It's called your character. Don't worry, I won't tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and
SPEEDMAN	You happy now? We're out of position for the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush! A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere.
SANDUSKY	I think they're really shooting at us!
SPEEDMAN	What are you guys worried about? These guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared.
SPEEDMAN	Come on, you guys! Let's use this! No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone. Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and
ON THE GUERRILLAS	Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of
FOUR LEAF	Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.
CODY	What? I still can't get Damien on the radio. I bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again. What do you say we get a little... pro-active? Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.
BACK ON THE ACTORS	Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to blow them to kingdom come with RPGs. But before the guerillas have a chance--
I	t' Tropic Thunder 48.
ON CODY	He pushes down the plunger...
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!!	Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the
CODY	Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!. Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring
CODY	Oh shit.
FOUR LEAF	Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of the trailer 'right there!
REDYKULOUS	That was some sick shit! I wasn't even thinking bout the camera! The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all jungle, sensing that someone was out there.
SANDUSKY'	So what do we do now? Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.
SPEEDMAN	Damien said to head north. I'm guessing they've got more of these "battles" and Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way. Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a lot of clicks to cover! Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of
SANDUSKY	Uh...Sir, isn't it that way? Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances
SPEEDMAN	Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...
SANDUSKY	Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.
SPEEDMAN	Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it- to-it! Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly, in the jungle, by a small river. There's a GUARD TOWER overlooking a main gate, which It's all populated with tough-looking, well-armed badasses.
Tropic Thunder 50.	CODY AND FOUR LEAF, both hog-tied and unconscious, are heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere. A cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired.
UNSEEN LEADER	
PORTNOY	So... we're just supposed to keep walking?
SPEEDMAN	We'll see some action soon enough. And try to stay in character. We're on camera..
PORTNOY	What do you mean "soon"? Tropic Thunder 51.
SPEEDMAN	Whenever Damien decides it's time, I guess.
PORTNOY	When's that?
SPEEDMAN	I don't know. That's the whole point. Damien wants us tired and confused.
REDYKULOUS	Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for those objectives. Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus
SPEEDMAN	Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break, but be on the lookout for anything. Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break or not. Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled. Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears
LAZARUS (O.S.)	Psst. Hey. Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close
LAZARUS	Speedman is watching. I don't have much time. I don't really need to piss. I need to talk to you. You went to the boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read that map?
SANDUSKY	Yeah...
LAZARUS	Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That hoor's melt really thinks this is a movie. And he's got the lot of ya convinced. Tropic Thunder 52.
SANDUSKY	You saying you don'tithink they're filming us?
LAZARUS	Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you?
SANDUSKY	Well, yeah, I.guess. But
LAZARUS	Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee Speedman, right next to him.
SPEEDMAN	I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat
SPEEDMAN	Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and. he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal. And you're pretty handy with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle.
SANDUSKY	Kevin. Tropic Thunder 53. If you stick with the program, I'm gonna talk to some of the Dreamworks brass... there'll probably be a Teen Choice award in it for you. You have that potential.
SANDUSKY	Well, I --
SPEEDMAN	Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.
The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown	
SPEEDMAN	If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating
SPEEDMAN	Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead of us... No... its just that I don't feel so hot... I left my medication at the hotel.
REDYKULOUS	Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those "meds" for my own self. Lazarus moves up to Speedman.
LAZARUS	Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now?
SPEEDMAN	Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be!
Tropic Thunder 54.	WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of frame... We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW
LAZARUS	Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that map? S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.
SPEEDMAN	Yes! There is! Its just a little more' down to the... lefty-down part from the: village. Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act.
LAZARUS	I don't see a "Sampan" boat!
SPEEDMAN	Any second now one should come by. Alright men, into the water! Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water.
LAZARUS I	- L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We need to quit faffin' about and turn. around NOW! And... Lazarus grabs Sandusky.
LAZARUS	Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you, Sandusky? Kevin is caught, not sure what to d
SPEEDMAN	Wait! First of all... Now Speedman grabs him.
SPEEDMAN	Kelvin believes in this movie. And, second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer.
LAZARUS	No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves, a pretty shite one. The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels'
SPEEDMAN	THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only chance!
PORTNOY	Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until they send help! Or maybe try to get back to the hotel.
SPEEDMAN	Help from where! Need I remind you that Damien's orders were to -- --stay in character. Now, I already have an international box office presence, but for some of you, I'm guessing you might not want to screw this movie up! This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't believe it.
SPEEDMAN	.okay...C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go get those Viet Congs! Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.
LAZARUS	Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey, if you're so sure of yourself, why don't you let Kelvin have a look at the map?! Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough
SPEEDMAN	Be my guest. Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a Tropic Thunder 56.
SANDUSKY	We've been going the wrong way. 'We were supposed to be doing this: Sandusky traces his finger along the correct route -- a
SANDUSKY	instead, we did this. i I ï¿½1d Iv I. 11M% Sandusky draws a line due East --..into a. section of the.
PORTNOY	Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not cool at all. Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.
SPEEDMAN	I can't believe you people!. You're pussing out on me? We are supposed to be a unit!
LAZARUS	No one is "pussing out." They just prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can you get'us back to the landing zone without the map?
SANDUSKY	It might be tricky, but maybe.
LAZARUS	Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin' war with Mister Box Office? Or staying alive?
SPEEDMAN	Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna abandon this movie? A long tense. beat -- finally, Sandusky walks towards Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his
SPEEDMAN	So that's the way it,,is, huh? Fine! I'll finish the movie alone! And when I give my acceptance speech, I'll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for staying out of that scene. And come Oscar night, we'll see who feels a little "full retard"! He reaches the other side of the river.
SANDUSKY	Chris, You have no idea where you're going!
SPEEDMAN	Yeah, I do! I'm going to "EX'S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE". And, I can shoot it alone. They'watch him trudge into the foliage. U2'S "BULLET THE BLUE SKY" comes up as the men watch
CLOSER	Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted. He is
SPEEDMAN	DORF!...CODY?!...What's the deal with a meal break? Are they gonna chopper stuff in later on? I don't wanna be a prima donna or anything, but, we gotta eat, right? Damien?
P- 'Tropic Thunder 58.	Clearly no answer. He trudges a bit further finally 'plunking down.by the He empties his pack, within which is the gift bag.from
PORTNOY	Uhhh... .UHHHHHHHH. Ohhhhh-Maaaaaaannn...I'm cold. It's
PORTNOY	Ohhh GOD! Is'anybody BOILING!? It's like a sweat lodge out here!
LAZARUS	Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art. A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy looks a little hurt.
REDYKULOUS	You know what? I think I actually liked you better when you were a nigga.
LAZARUS	You know, Redykulous', I respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking -- invented by the Irish I might add. Tropic Thunder 59. Yet you ooze this hostility towards me. Why do you think that-is?
REDYKULOUS	"Why"?! I dunno...maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy.
LAZARUS	Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're mad because I can act "black" better than you can.
SANDUSKY	Take it easy guys...
REDYKULOUS	You better rein in 'black like me' over here, before I put a foot in his white ass...
LAZARUS	Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.
SANDUSKY	Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's not enough we have people shooting at us! Now we have to kill each other?! Let's pull it together! This place is full of land mines! Or doesn't anyone's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel? That shut them up.
LAZARUS	Sandusky is right... we could all learn a little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and
LAZARUS	Your bravery shames us. Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of. fur... Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness, hold... He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally
SPEEDMAN	Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA... Speedman looks horrified...
,i	,Tropic Thunder 61. FLASH on a SERIES OF STILLS from SPEEDMAN'S PANDA PHOTO He stumbles back against a tree. Suddenly we hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and - forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when.
CLOSE ON PHONE -- CALLER ID SAYS "RICK PECK"	Speedman answers...
RICK	I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom. But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper. I killed one rick. The thing I love more than anything in the world...
RICK	A hooker? You killed a hooker? Calm down, it's fine. This is a no-brainer. Thank GOD you're out of the country.
SPEEDMAN	No! A Panda! I killed a panda!
RICK	You WHAT? Uhy. Heavy shit National Park. Oh jeesus...take a breath.. .did anybody see you?
RICK	Chill zone, buddy, 1im thinking. Did anyone see you do this?
SPEEDMAN	I don't think so. I'm out in.the bush. Alone.
RICK	Alright. Listen to me. I want.you to.get your hands on some-bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and some lime. Your gonna wanna cut the body in quarters ... the femurs are gonna be a bitch... that's normal... Speedman'nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a
RICK (O.S.)	Chris? Breathe.! It's gonna be ok.. I'm calling that publicist right now, the one J Lo hired when she was'hammered and killed that kid with her Jetski. A guerilla shoots the phone. They quickly tie Speedman.up There are security cameras everywhere. In Speedman''s
SPEEDMAN	Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it on Dorf.
CODY	Where are we? Tropic Thunder 63.
FOUR LEAF	In a detention hut. And they got Speedman... A guard shoves Speedman hard with a rifle butt. Speedman
BACK ON CODY AND FOUR LEAF	Cody gets up, starting to freak out
CODY	What? Why? We gotta get outta here! Are they gonna kill us? Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his
FOUR LEAF	Pull it together private! Shut your trap before you get us killed! You understand me , lilydick? ! Cody backs off, still scared. There are security cameras in the corners of the room, Byong stands across from him, watching him calmly. What were you doing in our poppy fields? Poppy fields?
BYONG	Who sent you here? Corporal Four Leaf Tayback...Serial number 694529987. 'Tropic Thunder 64. Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing. a little easier?
SPEEDMAN	You bastard.
BYONG	What? just thought you might like. some...
SPEEDMAN	Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh. yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM! He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into Beat.
SPEEDMAN	You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry. He looks around, impressed with the production design. He
SPEEDMAN	May God protect you from the mighty arm of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My men will seek you out and mete. out a cruel justice!- Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused. PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt
SANDUSKY	I think he's dead. A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy.
REDYKULOUS	No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled
44M	like that all night.
LAZARUS	What's wrong with him? Nothing! Probably just the beginning stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever. More bad noises.
PORTNOY	If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½? I think it might subside in a little bit... No one touches him.
LAZARUS	Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?
SANDUSKY	What?
LAZARUS	You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off.
SANDUSKY	God help me?
REDYKULOUS	God help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world. Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous spots something. ''I , I n n4ï¿½N11
REDYKULOUS	Look! From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the
SANDUSKY	SHH! Everybody down! The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them. He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.
BINOCULAR POV	It is the Flaming Dragon compound...
" LAZARUS	Fook me! I knew it!
-SANDUSKY	Knew what?
LAZARUS	and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements. Speedman was right. We 'are shooting the movie. Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking...
LAZARUS	How could I be so stupid.
SANDUSKY	I don't think so... . looks to me like some sort of heroin processing plant. Look at the cooking vats, and the guards. Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.
LAZARUS	How do you know all,this?
SANDUSKY	It was a long trip. I read the in-flight magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle, the biggest drug producer in the world. Uh-oh.
BINOCULAR POV	It is SPEEDMAN, who is being dipped in and out of the
LAZARUS	What do you see?
SANDUSKY	It doesn't look good. Lazarus grabs the binoculars.
LAZARUS	Sweet Mother of Jaysus. Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND! A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when REDYKULOUS stops and turns around and runs back to him, There is more fire coming all around. He gives up,
PORTNOY	Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?! He screams in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears
IN, THE HOLE	Totally black... . they huddle, trying to muffle their The guerillas all frantically look around for the guys. moving.
HOLE	Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area. Sandusky
SANDUSKY	Must be one of those underground tunnels. The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f must have found one of the entrances,:. Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.
PORTNOY	My ass...I think I took one in the ass...
SANDUSKY	Lemme see... Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove
SANDUSKY	How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust...
SANDUSKY'	Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell, but I have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if I can dig it out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his hand... Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera.
PORTNOY	Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it out! That's not the bullet hole. The bullet hole is over here! It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at
SANDUSKY	OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're gonna be fine. They begin to part, as someone very important is arriving. Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY, He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a rat. He holds a stick. Uhhh..I don't think I got the new pages... Tropic Thunder 70. Tran points across the courtyard where... A"4 Iv I. InM y CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks scared out. Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out
SPEEDMAN	No! Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt them... I Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He
TRAN	Say that. again.,
SPEEDMAN	Please don't hurt them?I
TRAN	No...like you did before! Silence. He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils.
SPEEDMAN	Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them? A hush falls over the crowd. Tran'seyes widen. whispering.
TRAN'S ENTOURAGE	Nyam nook snep jawk...
SPEEDMAN	Please! Excuse me, What are you saying?
TRAN	Nyam nook snep Jawk! You are Simple Jack?
SPEEDMAN	What? You.. You saw Simple Jack?
TRAN	We love the tale of this man, Simple Jack. Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a
TRAN	We do not have many luxury here. Simple Jack is the only movie we possess. We have watched it many, many times. How is the word? Genius? Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It's a small world after all.
BODYGUARD	You should have got Oscar.
SPEEDMAN	Thanks. I mean even just the nomination...
TRAN	You were nominated? Tropic Thunder 72.
SPEEDMAN	No, I mean it is great to.be nominated,.. if you are, or that's what I hear. Whatever. It's a popularity contest. It's totally political, you have to lobby for like a year for it...
TRAM	SHUT UP NOW. ilia i n nMd My apologies for almost.beating you to death before.
SPEEDMAN	No problem. So are you going to let me go?
TRAN	No. We will hold.you,for ransom.--.much more money now.. He pulls out a cell phone.
TRAM	Is it possible to.have picture?
SPEEDMAN	Oh, sure, absolutely. Speedman tries to throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs
TRAN	You mustn't touch me. The guard snaps the picture.
ABODYGUARD	That came out really good.
TRAN	Now, do the movie.
SPEEDMAN	Excuse me?
TRAN	Do the movie.
SPEEDMAN	The whole movie?
TRAN	Yes. Begin.
SPEEDMAN	Hey, I know you're big fans and that's
GREAT--	Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt. Tran stands over him, screaming into his face:
SWINE!1	Speedman gets up, begins a scared, unenthusiastic
SPEEDMAN	Aww, puh-puh-Pa! Whu-why you guh-got to muh-muh-make ffffffun of me?
TRAN	More stupid!
SPEEDMAN	Awww, puh-puh-paaaa... Tran turns to one of his men
TRAN	Get him some overalls! And give him the Simple Jack haircut!
SANDUSKY	It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I say we stay in here till it's dark.
REDYKULOUS	I can't believe this is how it ends for Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum recording artist., Shit.
PORTNOY	I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not gonna make.it...
SANDUSKY	Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're out'here. They'll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And no one else knows but us.
LAZARUS	That's right. So here's the plan. Everyone leans forward expectantly.
LAZARUS	We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's situation.
REDYKULOUS	Sounds good.
SANDUSKY	Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just gonna leave him here?
REDYKULOUS	Yeah, and I don't wanna spend another minute getting the full on smell'o vision in this hole with his stinky ass. Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks horrified. SANDUSKY Au II4 WAIT! Look, I don't think I've met a more wildly self involved human than Speedman, but you're just gonna leave him here? I mean, come on. He's a person, guys. These drug lords are killers. I mean, they eat their enemies. We leave him alone now, he doesn't have a chance in hell.
LAZARUS,	That tosser is in there because of his own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned, he brought it on himself.
REDYKULOUS	Besides, how could we possibly rescue him? Get real, Sandusky, we don't know what the fuck we doing out here.
SANDUSKY	We've gotten this far. Look, we're making a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean, those guys weren't superheroes! They were just put in extra-ordinary circumstances, and they rose to the occasion.
PORTNOY	Yeah, but they were trained soldiers. They knew how to take care of themselves.
SANDUSKY	And we don't? They believed they could do it. They believed in each other. Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. I mean, some of us might not come back.
REDYKULOUS	You mean, like, not on the same flight? Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what he meant. Tropic Thunder 76.
SANDUSKY	Jeff -- I know this is really hard for you,.â¢but you're gonna have to kick some time, and it might as well be now. Kirk, I've always admired you as an actor. But as a person, I have to say, not that impressive.' You got a.few Oscars. Got any balls? Lazarus takes this in.
SANDUSKY	Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good game, but how's it gonna feel when you're sipping Cristalle with your homies.in the hot tub back in.Cali knowing you left.a man to die back here? You gonna rhyme about that? , There is a long beat.
REDYKULOUS	Shit. I only wish they was filming this for my show. I'm in. He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause..
LAZARUS	We could fooster about for donkey's years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller. The guys look at each other. What did that mean?
LAZARUS.	I'm in!
HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT	Chris Michael is on the line.
RICK	Chris? What is this craziness?
SPEEDMAN (V.0.)	Hi, Rick. It's Chris--
RICK (O.S.)	Chris?
BYON G	Yes, that was Chris. But you will not speak with him again. And do not bother trying to trace this call.
RICK	What's going on? Who is this?
BYONG	We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with us now. There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he nods slowly.
RICK	Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your little agency. But if you wanna poach my client? Lemme tell you something. His career's been in a death spiral since Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn't even told you about the whole panda thing! He killed a panda! And next time you're at a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg whites with Ron Howard, DON'T LET THAT SLIP, because chances are, I ALREADY DID! Rick slams the phone down.
I	Tropic Thunder 78. haircut.,He is performing for a small group, of chuckling.
LAZARUS	Jaysus! We're too late. They brained him! REDYKULOUS grabs the binoculars. Sees for himself.
REDYKULOUS	He's right, man, that ain't right. Messin' with a man's brain.
SANDUSKY	We gotta get him outta there...
SANDUSKY'	Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's where Speedman was. It looks like they move him at night, cause he's not here now. Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is. But Speedman does. If we can get in there, and find him, maybe he can help us sneak him out.
PORTNOY	I got an idea. Everyone turns to Portnoy.
PORTNOY	It might be a little crazy, but...
REDYKULOUS	Crazy is better than nothin'.
SANDUSKY	What is it?
PORTNOY	Back in '98, I did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls' camp. So we did it by building a catapult. They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down. The guys all look at each other... then finally:
LAZARUS	That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
SANDUSKY	Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval.
SANDUSKY	Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and Redyk are on first watch. I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll switch. They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out.
I	Tropic Thunder 80.
PORTNOY	I'm not gonna make it.
SANDUSKY	Yes you are.
PORTNOY	Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious. Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I scream, or however much-I plead, you.must not untie me. I will be cunning, I will be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil works this way. I will say, do, and excrete many regrettable things. But.no matter what.. .you must leave me alone. Beat..
SANDUSKY	Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him up. We'll get you through it. bodyguard plays a supporting female role, he wears a mop for a wig.
BODYGUARD	Jack...I could never go -to the county ho- down with you. I would be laughed out of town. And what would Chet say? The bodyguards laugh woodenly at Speedman.
SPEEDMAN	B-b-b-b-but I am a G-g-g-ggggoood Dd-d-d- d-dancer. Speedman bows, exhausted and exhilarated. The old women
SPEEDMAN	Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty sssssssunrise, uh-uh-uh-uh-ain't it?
BODYGUARD	Go do your chores, slowpoke!! 11l I I, I. Inti"
FOUR LEAF	That poor bastard. Looks like they coo- coo nested him. So what's the plan?
FOUR LEAF	What plan?
CODY	To get us out of here? Come on man, yoi4 lived this, you gotta have an idea of how we can get out of here? Right? Four Leaf looks a little at a loss...
FOUR LEAF	Sometimes the flowing stream can only move when... the water... dries up.
CODY	No offense, but what the hell does that mean?
FOUR LEAF	It means I'm,sick of your yappin'!
CODY	Come on man, you heard him back there. They wanna off us! We gotta escape! You
GOTTA--	Four Leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right up to Cody's
FOUR LEAF	I gotta what? Take on the whole compound by myself!
CODY	Stop it man! You're chokin' me! Cody tries to push him away. They get into a wrestling
CODY	AHH! Who the hell are you? Four Leaf looks down, sheepishly. SANDUSKY AND.REDYKULOUS, who sit upright, back to back,
SANDUSKY	Wow... .look at all those stars. Makes a guy feel pretty small.
REDYKULOUS	Yup.
SANDUSKY	Back in LA, we don't get stars like this. I wonder why there are so many here?
PORTNOY (O.S.)	Ohhhh...jeeesssusss..it's horrrrible.:...
REDYKULOUS	Man, how can;, you be talking about stars? We might not make it outta here tomorrow.
SANDUSKY	I don't know. I give us pretty good odds. Redykulous looks at'his watch, and lets out a chuckle.
SANDUSKY	What's so funny?
REDYKULOUS	Nothin'.. .I can't feel my legs!...
REDYKULOUS	I'm just thinking about Lill Kantankerous Bitch.
SANDUSKY	Who?
REDYKULOUS	She's a rapper I'm producing, a twelve year old girl. Her first single drops tomorrow and I'm not even gonna be there to see it. Ohhhhh GOD! THERE'S BARBED WIRE IN MY
REDYKULOUS	I pulled her off the streets six months ago.
SANDUSKY	You did that?
REDYKULOUS	Well, not literally, she was trapped in a dead end record deal with Rick Rubin. Didn't even have a lawyer. Huh. And here I am on the other side of the world. About to die for a guy I barely even know. Makes Redykulous wonder what's it all about.
SANDUSKY	Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to think about.
REDYKULOUS	You single?
SANDUSKY	Yeah,... .I guess. I dunno. I got a girl. But it's not too serious.
SANDUSKY	I don't think we're in love.
PORTNOY (O.S.)	Ohh... . thank God...its Over ...it's finally over...
SANDUSKY:	It'.s kind of depressing. That feeling of not having anyone who really loves you.. Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him..
REDYKULOUS	Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely lovable. Weird silence.
SANDUSKY	What?
REDYKULOUS	I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean. I have love problems myself!
SANDUSKY	.No you don't. What would the great Redykulous, know about Girl Problems. You're ten girls deep 24 hours a day!
REDYKULOUS	.That's the problem. Silence.
SANDUSKY	How do you mean? OHH GOOD!!!1 make it stop! ... .Pahllleeeeeese!
REDYKULOUS	Jeesus, I can't believe I'm gonna tell you this... Beat.
REDYKULOUS	I'm... .I like guys.
SANDUSKY	What? But... Ohh...phew...
REDYKULOUS	I know-impossible huh. That's what I say sometimes, but its true. Talk abort living a loveless life. At least you have someone who loves you. I don't even have that.
REDYKULOUS	When I think of the nights, alone in my penthouse, when I've longed for the gentle touch of another dude, to feel his skin against mine, or his sweet breath on my face.
SANDUSKY	All this from the same guy who wrote"Niggaz Gotta Bust a Nut on a Ho".
REDYKULOUS	Yeah, well, let me let you in on a big secret. .Tropic Thunder 86. Most of the time, when I'm writing about ho's in my songs, 'I really mean Niggaz. Creatively, that's the only way I can cope.
SANDUSKY	So what! You're gay! You're also a great artist and-businessman ... why not rap about that? ï¿½u IÂ° I. 11ï¿½jm
REDYKULOUS	Yeah right. And watch my clothing line, e4ï¿½ sports drink,jewelry, nutrition, bars, and fragrances go south? It's all such a lie. Now he begins to cry .a. little. Sandusky embraces him.
SANDUSKY.	Shhh...shhh... .shhh..shhh..shhh... .That's it...let it out.
REDYKULOUS	If you tell anyone I'll have someone shoot your. ass.
SANDUSKY	I'm not gonna tell anyone, and your not gonna shoot me... .th-at's it...l-et -tout. Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself.
REDYKULOUS	Aww shit... (sniff sniff) I can't. believe it's possibly the last day of my life, and I'm not even gonna be able to let my fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I really am.
SANDUSKY	Listen, I know how utterly Redykulous you are. Even for just.thisone moment. . .and sometimes that enough. Tropic Thunder 87.
REDYKULOUS	Thanks man.
CODY	So all of "Tropic Thunder" is bullshit?
FOUR LEAF	No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it happened!
CODY	Are you even a VET!?
FOUR LEAF	YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not exactly. I served honorably in what they called the "forced service". Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon.
CODY	So you were some two bit criminal who got caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN!
FOUR LEAF	God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a fuckup, sure, but one day as I was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big- wig, I came across a file headed for the shredder marked top secret. It was Four Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family. Nothing. Killed in Action. They were gonna bury the whole thing. Total black op.
CODY	So you decided to take his identity?
FOUR LEAF	NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story And I gave the American people a hero! Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was! See what I'm sayin'? Tropic Thunder 88.
CODY	And you cashed in!
FOUR LEAF	I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy had a story worth-telling, and nobody woulda ever known! Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost.
FOUR LEAF	I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this .whole mess.
PORTNOY	I'm clean! I'M CLEAN!!!!! He struggles to his feet, doing a celebratory dance. He

SPEEDMAN	Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.
REDYKULOUS	What's wrong with him?
SANDUSKY	I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like from the movie?
LAZARUS'	Shite. I was afraid of this. The same thing happened to me when I played Neil Armstrong in "Moonshot". They found me in an alley in Burbank re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator box. Tropic Thunder 96.
REDYKULOUS	I heard that movie was good.
SANDUSKY	Can you fix him?!
LAZARUS	I'll try. Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to

YOU ARE!	Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.
LAZARUS	You know who you are... . you do Chris. Long beat.
LAZARUS	Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.
REDYKULOUS	Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'. so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk Lazarus! You're like the greatest actor in the motherfuckin' world!
SANDUSKY	Guys, let's go, we gotta get outta here! I it I. 11h.4%

REDYKULOUS	That's right! We're.not what we're called, or who we pretend to be. We are what we are in our hearts. And to me, looking into your heart, you're a hero.. Lazarus looks to Redykulous.
LAZARUS	You mean that?
REDYKULOUS	.Yup. '- -Tropic Thunder 99. And one of the finest pieces of black ass I ever seen come out of Belfast. Thera,... from off camera.
SPEEDMAN	And I'll second that. They all'turn to see...SPEEDMAN. The million-dollar smile

SPEEDMAN	Follow me. This time they do...

SPEEDMAN	That's their supply chopper.
SANDUSKY	If we could create a diversion, we could get to that jeep and drive it right over there... "Ttopic Thunder 100.
PORTNOY	Anybody here know how to fly a helicopter? Cause that would come in, handy too.
SPEEDMAN	You want a diversion? I'll give you a diversion. Is this baby loaded? He holds up the machine gun...

I'M TRYING!!	Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is genuinely having trouble getting in.-the chopper. But then Speedman sees something...
SPEEDMAN	It's him...
SPEEDMAN'S POV	FOUR LEAF... much-like.Speedman playing him in the Cody lowers the chopper ... Speedman jumps out...
SPEEDMAN	Cover me! Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of
i- Tropic Thunder 103.	Speedman reaches Four Leaf and collapses beside him, cradling his head. Trap's men continue to bear down on them...
FOUR LEAF	Go on...get outta here. I'm worm food, you dig? You have hands?
ON THE CHOPPER	The guys are busy shooting off their attackers, but they
BACK TO SPEEDMAN AND FOUR LEAF	The life is draining from Four Leaf (Marvin)...
FOUR LEAF	I ain't Four Leaf, Chris. We're in this mess because of me.
SPEEDMAN	How did you get hands?
FOUR LEAF	I ain't never been worth a nothin'...and it's too late to start bein' a somethin' now. Speedman tries to understand. He is welling up with emotion.. .real emotion. But you... you can tell the story. . .You have to tell the real story... And Four Leaf... or Marvin... dies. Speedman begins to weep. Tears. Yes, he is crying, for real... Only... LAZARUS (CAUCASIAN AGAIN BUT LOOKING ALOT LIKE attention...
