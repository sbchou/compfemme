CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
Grace buys a bag of 240	jellybeans. There are 35 yellow ones, 52 red ones, 63 green ones, 26 white ones, 41 blue ones and 40 black ones. If Grace wants to eat one of each while keeping her eyes closed, what is the minimum number she will have to eat? Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could
TEACHER	No, that's not exactly right. Your son seems to be interested in only one thing. Mom knows what's coming.
TEACHER (CONT'D)	All he talks about, all he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing.
MOM	Well you know, his father designs racing cars.
TEACHER	And where is your husband?
MOM	He's-working. He couldn't make it.
TEACHER	Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree. Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher
TEACHER (CONT'D)	Is your husband's name Rex?
MOM	No, Rex is his older brother. Why?
TEACHER	This is the test he turned in last week. She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on. He continues to draw as the background of the classroom We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash, The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning The teacher is about to say something when the bell Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up, in motion
TEACHER	Alright, pencils down, bring your Thwack! Speed slaps his down and is already heading for --to my desk. Ham! The door slams open and Speed shoots out.
TEACHER (CONT'D)	Speed Racer, slow down! He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature The car door pops open and snaps shut.
REX	.I take it you're ready to go? Speed nods. Rex climbs in beside him.
REX (CONT'D)	So, who was school?
YOUNG SPEED	Fine. Are you going to the track? Mom said you were. You don't have to drop me off, I could just go with you.
REX	No way. He starts the car and roadster growls to life.
YOUNG SPEED	Oh, come on, take me with you. Come on, please.
REX	I can't, Speed. Pops would kill me.
YOUNG SPEED	He doesn't have to know. I won't say anything. Nobody will know. Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease pleasepleasepleeeease. Rex sighs, knowing there's no way he can with this.
REX	Are you wearing the socks? Lickety-split, Speed sticks his sneaker up against the
REX (CONT'D)	You roll us again and this'll be the last time? Deal? A ten year old's grin spreads ear to ear.
YOUNG SPEED	Deal. He is wearing a pair of bright red socks. Propped against this gloves is a photo of Rex.
REX	Feel that shimmy? That's your hind legs trying to outrun you're front.
SPEED	What do I do?
REX	Stop steering and start driving. Speed gets serious, his lips tightening the way a hand
REX (CONT'D)	This ain't no dead piece a metal. A car's a living breathing thing. She's alive. You can feel her talking to you, telling you what she wants, what she needs. You just gotta listen. Speed tries to listen.
REX (CONT'D)	Close your eyes and listen. Speed does.
REX (CONT'D)	They say that Ben burns drove the last lap of the '68 Vanderbilt Cup with his eye closed.
SPEED	No way!
REX	No? Well maybe you can't hear it then. Maybe. you ought to start hitting those books--
SPEED	No! I hear it!
REX	That so? Okay Mr. Burns, you tell me when to gas it for the jump. Speed concentrates..
REX (CONT'D)	Now?
SPEED	Uh-uh. The jump glides towards them as the tires seem to whisper Now! Rex smiles, hitting the gas, launching the car into the Thunderhead is a relatively small track and the media-row

SPEED	I got him. Sparky is watching through binoculars.
SPARKY	I figure he'll slingshot after you in the next turn.
SPEED	I'm ready. Hurling like a bullet straight at Speed as-- Snake flies under it, careening into the bottom of the He turns his wheels, catching a part of Snake's car with Speed rockets free-- Eliciting a huge roar from the crowd.
SPARKY	Great move, Speed. Careful on the butterfly coming up. You may wanna ease up--
SPEED	Not this time, Sparky.
SPARKY	Holy canoli, Speed, You know who you're racing? He can see him.
SPEED	Yeah... Just ahead, the ghost of his brother's car launches up
YOUNG SPEED	Rex's gonna win, ain't he, Pops? Pops checks his watch but almost can't believe it. He He's gonna win it. He's gonna set the course record. Nobody's gonna catch him.
POPS	Quiet, Speed! There's a lotta race to run.
YOUNG SPPED	No way. It's over. My brother's the best racer in the world. Everybody else is running for second. The cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel.
BLACKJACK BENELLI	I told you to take him out!
CREW CHIEF #1	We're trying, sir. He's just too fast. As we move around Rex's car, we see suddenly there is Speed. As Speed makes his move, he pulls us back into the

SPRITTLE	Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He could really do it, couldn't he? Pops goes back to his binos. What if he does? What if he does it, Pops?
POPS	Sssh!
SPRITTLE	I don't know if I can watch this... He holds the binos as though afraid to look when-- Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young
BLONDE PACK LEADER	My Daddy told me he used to work for the Mishida Motorwerks but he quit.
BLONDE PACK LEADER (CONT'D)	My daddy said that was a completely crazy thing to do. He says the whole family is crazy.
TRIXIE	Speed's not crazy.
BLONDE PACK LEADER	No, he's just dumb. Probably the dumbest kid in class. Ms. Waterstraat had me alphabetize the IRB tests and you wouldn't believe what that retard did-- Sock! Trixie decks her to the shock of the rest of the pack Zipping past, he suddenly notices the girl in the pink Maybe it's way she's got her fists up, like a boy, or
ANYONE--	Whatever it is, when their eyes suddenly meet, he finds Staring at her, as he drives off the road, crashing
TRIXIE	Speed! She runs to help him. He is laying sprawled out, his car on its side, wheels Are you alright? He's a bit groggy.
SPEED	.who are you?
TRIXIE	I'm Trixie. I'm in your class.
SPEED	.oh .yeah. He stares at her for a minute, powder-puffs of clouds
SPEED (CONT'D)	He, would you like to see my car

TRIXIE	I'd love to.
SPEED	Hey, Rex. Hey Pops.
RE X	Hey, Speedy.
POPS	Who's your friend?
SPEED	Her name's Trixie. She's in my class.
TRIXIE	Hi.
POPS	Pleasure to meet you, young lady.
SPEED	Hey pops, a guy wanted me to give this to you. He said he was a big fan. He hands him the package and Pops smiles.
POPS	A fan, is it? Not often we get someone with such good taste around here. Where is he?
SPEED	He was in a hurry. Driving a '68 Fendersin. Sweet set. of wheels. The car description rings a bell for Rex.
REX	Let me see that. He grabs the box, then holds it to his ear. He jams it into the go-cart, against the pedal and slaps The go--.cart shoots out of the garage and down the It explodes, an enormous fireball ballooning up past the Trixie's eyes flash with excitement.

REX	I don't know. I don't know. He snaps the bag shut.
REX (CONT'D)	Look, Speed... one day people might say things about me. No matter what they say, I hop... I just hope you never believe them.
SPEED	I won't. He hugs his little brother, knowing it might be for the
POPS	So, you're quitting?
REX	I have to. No you don't. This is a choice. You're selling out, walking away from everything we've built here.
REX	I'm done arguing with you Pops. He turns back towards the door.
POPS	Don't you walk away from me!
REX	You can't tell me what to do. It's my life to live. He takes hold of the doorknob.
POPS	If you walk out that door, you better not ever come back! The door slams in response.

MOM	That's not for you to say.
SPRITTLE	Speed's gotta drive for Pops!
MOM	That's for Speeed to decide. The phone rings again. Sprittle grabs it quickly.
SPRITTLE	Hello? Is this the Racer residence? He glances at Mom.
SPRITTLE	Nope. He hangs up. Shrugs.

MOM	That's enough of that, Hon. Pops puts down the paper and Sparky picks it up.
SPARKY	I just can't believe there wasn't one mention of Racer motors in there.
POPS	That's because the Sponsors run the media, Sparky. Trixie enters through the back door.
TRIXIE	Mornin' everyone. Is Speed up yet? Speed stumbles in the door.
SPEED	.in spirit anyway.
TRIXIE	Hey superstar, did you see the papers? They're all in love with you.
SPEED	Really? He sits, grabbing the paper.
SPARKY	Yeah, but there sure is a lot of speculation about which team's going to pick him up
SPEED	.really? Speed starts to read and suddenly the room begins to
POPS	What the--?
SPRITTLE	Earthquake! He and Chim-chim begin wailing in panic.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)	Quick, under the table! Into the door-frame!
POPS	Sprittle calm down!

WELL DRESSED MAN	Mr. And Mrs. Racer, I hope you will forgive this imposition. He hands her the beautiful bouquet of flowers.
WELL DRESSED MAN (CONT'D)	These are Blue-belles from EDEN Inc. I'm told the will bloom at least three times, each time a different color. .Mom "ohhhs" her appreciation, while he hands over the box
WELL DRESSED MAN (CONT'D)	And Mr. Racer these are for you, straight form the Isle of Kamut. Hand-rolled. Premium blend. They glance at each other, a bit takenaback.
POPS	Uh, thanks but... who are you? He seems to rise up an inch taller as he introduces
WELL DRESSED MAN	I am E.P. Arnold Remmingtonton Esquire, President and Chairman of Remmington Industries and it is my honor to meet you both. He reaches for Pops' free hand.
REMMINGTON	Mr. Racer, I have been an ardent admirer of your work for years. I remember the first time I saw the prototype for the Mach-1, I told everyone that it didn't belong on a race track, it belonged in an art museum. Pops chuckles.
POPS	Yeah, she was a beaut.
REMMINGTON	No, sir. She was a revelation. He suddenly smells the pancakes.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Oh, dear. I interrupted your breakfast. Is that pancakes, I smell?
MOM	Are you hungry, Mr. Remmington?
REMMINGTON	A figure like mine requires constant attention, Mrs. Racer.
MOM	Do you like pancakes?
REMMINGTON	When I was a child we used to say, "pankuken zin liesben." Neither of them speak German.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Pancakes are love. Sprittle and Chim--chim sit on either side of him, their
REMMINGTON	Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer. Superb density. Hints of vanilla. Cinnamon. Absolutely gorgeous.
MOM	I'm glad you like them.
REMMINGTON	Like them? I want to-buy your recipe. He takes out his hand held computer and beings making
MOM	I can give you the recipe, Mr. Remmington.
REMMINGTON	Nonsense. Cenestro Foods, a sub- division of Remmington Industries is planning a new range of home- cooked meals for travelers and this is just the kind of magic we're looking for. I'll have my attorney draw up the paperwork. Mom looks at Pops feeling flattered but again a distinct
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Now, then. We all know the reason I'm here is because of you, Speed. I was watching last night and I have to tell you young man, you gave me goosebumps. I know at once, this was no mere driver I was watching. This was an artist. Speed's ears go a bit red.
SPEED	Driver's only as good as the car.
REMMINGTON	I appreciate modesty, Speed but I do not exaggerate when is ay that you are a genius. Watching you reminded me of why I love racing and I am grateful for that. Thank you.
SPEED	You're welcome, I guess.
REMMINGTON	I imagine the phone has been ringing off the hook.
SPRITTLE	Speed's not interest in driving for you or any other sponsor.
REMMINGTON	Is this your manager then?
MOM	He's our youngest. Sprittle.
REMMINGTON	Nice to meet you, youngster. Remmington offers his hand but Sprittle doesn't take it.
SPRITTLE	We got out eye on you, Mister.
REMMINGTON	Excellent. The first thing I want to make perfectly clear is that I have no intention whatsoever of trying to get Speed away from Racer motors. What you have here is what teams spend years and millions of dollars trying to achieve: chemistry. Car designer, mechanic and driver all coming together in perfect, harmony. I wouldn't dare touch a thing.
SPEED	Well, excuse me for asking, but what do you want?
REMMINGTON	To help. I want to make sure you have access to whatever resources you need to continue doing exactly what you are doing.
POPS	I assume, Mr. Remmington that you are not talking about philanthropy. Remmington chuckles.
REMMINGTON	I like when my partners have a sense of humor. And that's what I'm talking about. A partnership. An alliance between your amazing family and mine. That's exactly what Remmington Industries is to me, a family. Like yours. Just a little bigger. Pops isn't exactly buying it.
POPS	No offense, Remmington but Racer Motors runs as an independent.
REMMINGTON	None taken. I completely understand. I sympathize. Strike that-- I sympathize. You may think of R. I. As a huge corporate conglomerate but I will have you know sire, that I still remember working all night on a Commodore 64 in the basement of my foster parents' home. I build R.I. From below the ground up. So while Remmington Industries may look like a Major Sponsor to you, it remains in my heart as independent to me as the first day I quit my job at GloBocom to work for myself. They're 're stunned into silence, while Remmington
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Now I've had this wonderful opportunity to meet your family. All I am asking is for you to please give me the chance to introduce you to.mine. Helicopters swarm like pollinating bees in summer field.
MOM	I've never flown so low through the city.

POPS	Sprittle!
SPRITTLE	She said we could! Pop growls at him, his eyes telling them they'd better Hang-dogged heads, they each grab one piece of candy?
POPS	What do you say?
SPRITTLE	Thank you. She closes the drawer, their eyes seen through the racks,
SPARKY	Hey, there's the Grand Prix Coliseum! Sprittle and Chim-chim rush to Sparky's window. They can Sprittle turns to Remmington.
SPRITTLE	My brother's going to win the Grand Prix one day. Remmington's eyes glint.
REMMINGTON	No doubt in my mind; young man. Given the right circumstances, I have no doubt whatsoever. The K-Harrier glides gracefully down to the private
REMMINGTON	This is Gennie. She's our Talent Manager. Ask for anything, her job's to make it come true.

REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Of all the 143 companies that I control, none of them is as dear to my heart as the T-180 division. The door opens as they enter---
REMMINGTON	I've always felt that it is impossible to peer into the window of Tomorrow without a clear view of the Past.
SPRITTLE	That's the Crystal Horse with the Apache Super--Charger!
REMINGTON	Winner of the Grand Prix in '69, ' 70 and '73.
SPRITTLE	No. Wrong. '72. '71 was the Vundervopper with the K-2 twin turbine and '73 was the Kenobe Motorstar re-built with a VC ;triple chamber. Remmington considers arguing.
SPEED	Don't bother. He's never wrong. They pass out of the museum. The bank of windows overlooks the enormous facility. It
REMINGTON	Our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world. From initial carbon bond to finished car in 36 hours. How long does it take at Racer Motors?
SPARKY	Several weeks at least. Remmington turns to Pops.
REMINGTON	This kind of production facility could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer. The cart motor hums and slides back onto the tramway. It looks like an operating theatre with several robotic
REMMINGTON	where our patented Refusion Energy Distributor Network is installed in the turbine drive. Sparky's eye light up.
SPARKY	Is that an inner-positive transponder?
REMMINGTON	It is indeed. Sparky shoots a look at Pops.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	We control the only transponder foundry in the world outside of Mushi Motors in Taiobi. The window suddenly turns into a mirror.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Oops. Sorry. Trade Secrets.
REMMINGTON	Now, I'll take you up to the Team Remmington training facility. The west door opens and the cart glides out into a new The higher you go in the Remmington Tower, the nicer the
REMMINGTON	As you know, a T-180 driver's got to be in peak physical condition.

The final window is the weather chamber where a driver is
REMMINGTON	I hope I didn't care you, Speed with how hard we push our team. I just wanted you to see how serious we are committed to winning.
SPEED	I get that.
REMMINGTON	Good. But also understand that R.I. Isn't all work and no play. The door opens revealing the Drivers' Club. Sprittle's eyes almost pop out.
SPRITTLE	That's Cannonball Taylor! Speed urns and sees the Captain of the Remmington Team.
REMMINGTON	Stop the cart. Jack! Jack, come here. There's someone I want you to meet. Cannonball saunters over, wearing his two goiter-sized,
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Speed Racer allow me to introduce two-time Grand Prix Winner, five time WRL Champion and future Hall of Famer, Jack Cannonball Taylor.
SPEED	Honor to meet you.
CANONBALL	Caught that Thunderhead replay. Nice piece of work.
SPEED	Wow, thanks.
CANONBALL	There was a rumor you might be visiting.
SPEED	It's pretty impressive.
CANONBALL	Only thing I cared about was that wall over there. He gestures to a special wall fitted with the trophies
CANONBALL (CONT'D)	That' what sold me. You want to win in this league, you're talking to the right guy. Remmington beams.
REMMINGTON	Thanks, Jack. Jack nods and the cart pulls away but not before Jack Sparky whistles and whispers to Speed.
SPARKY	Long way from Nob Hill, eh?
REMMINGTON	We treat our thoroughbreds the way they deserve to be treated. He guides them into the room gesturing or demonstrating
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	There's full maid service of course with a personal chef and a masseuse available 24/7. The staff arrives, wheeling in several racks of clothes: Gennie holds up one of the suit to Speed.
GENNIE	Should be perfect. Try it on.
TRIXIE	Mmm hmm!
SPEED	.okay. He heads to the bathroom. Taking Mom by the elbow, Remmington gestures to the
REMMINGTON	So Mrs. Racer, what do you think about my family? Impressed?
MOM	You could say that.
REMMINGTON	Good. I want you to understand the possibilities that exist for your son right now. Pops furrows his brow.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	What's wrong Mr. Racer?
POPS	To be honest, Remmington, I'm feeling more intimidated than impressed. This kind of company scares me. People like you have way too much money and when someone has this kind of money, they start thinking that the rules everyone else is playing by don't mean squat to them. Remmington remains skillfully unfazed.
POPS (CONT'D)	However, my sons are the most important thing I've ever done in my life, besides marrying my best friend and if Speed wants us to figure out some kind of... "alliance" then you can bet your ass we'll be in business. Speed steps out of the bathroom. His boyishness has faded
TRIXIE	Hubba hubba. He walks over to the sitting area.
MOM	Oh honey, you looks so handsome.
SPEED	Yeah?
REMMINGTON	Very sharp, Speed. Suits you perfectly. Regardless of what happens, I want you to have all of it. A gift.
SPEED	Thanks, Mr. Remmington.
REMMINGTON	So, how are you feeling Speed? Speed isn't sure. He looks at Trixie and Sparky and then
SPEED	It's very... impressive. Remmington smiles.
REMMINGTON	You think that maybe there's something that could work out here? Everyone waits, staring at him.
SPEED	I guess I'd like to think about it, if I .could. has really Remmington's a fisherman not sure if the hook been set.
REMMINGTON	This isn't the kind of offer I go around making ever day, son.
SPEED	I understand that, sir... He looks to Pops then takes a deep breath as though
SPEED (CONT'D)	So if I had to give an answer now then, to be honest--
REMMINGTON	Stop. Right there. You're right. You should think about it. I'm sure you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. You should take a little time. Think about what you saw and heard here and we'll get together early next week. Deal? He reaches his hand out and Speed takes it with some
SPEED	Deal. When the beating is over, the Japanese man slumps
CRUNCHER	Ithought we had a deal... When he hears the voice, he lifts his head and we see a This well-dressed fixer is Cruncher Block.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	I thought we were friends. He blows a cloud of smoke and watches it float up to the

THUG #1	You hurt our feelings!
CRUNCHER	Problem is, I like you Katsu. Cruncher grins, his teeth like stacked dice.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	And I got a real soft spot in my heart for that sister of yours. He begins opening a large package wrapped with butcher
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	Normally in a situation such as this we would be pouring you a nice comfy pair of cement shoes, but... He stands and goes to the large glowing fish tank that is

KATSU	No! Hope dem fishes like Japanese.
KATSU	No, please!
THUG #1	Gonna be hard to drive with skellie hands. Cruncher takes hold of Katsu's jaw.
CRUNCHER	You even think about turning rat and next time it's your sister going in there.
A	They begin forcing his hand into the tank when suddenly Everyone freezes. Cruncher grabs the phone on his desk.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	What?!
TRUCK DRIVER	Someone's tailing us.
CRUNCHER	is it him?
DOOR GUARD	It could be. Cruncher goes to the phone.
CRUNCHER	Can you see him yet?
TRUCK DRIVER	Here he comes-- The car pulls up even with the cab and the driver feels Oh God...
CRUNCHER	Get him! Everyone leaps into action, shoving Katsu back into a

CRUNCHER	Where is he?
TRUCK DRIVER	He's out front. An Apache helicopter-style rocket launcher thrusts out of Cruncher sights the car.
CRUNCHER	Gotcha. He fires a mini-rocket straight at the manta-finned car-- Something flashes on the back car as hidden tubes iris
TRUCK DRIVER	Here he comes! Cruncher fires again, the red rocket just missing, The little car drops back alongside the truck and fires, Cruncher tries to site the machine gun but just as he The black car slows, drawing the chasing gun fire until
CRUNCHER	Aww, I thought you fixed that! The black car fires again, bullets ricocheting inside,
THUG #1	Boss!
CRUNCHER	My babies! He runs to the fish tank and tries to stop the water He shrieks withdrawing his finger.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	Vinny put your finger in there! Vinny doesn't want to. Do it!
TRUCK DRIVER	We can't take another hit boss!
CRUNCHER	Pull over but don't stop. The back of the truck slides up and the gangsters toss Racer x.
KATSU	Thank you. You saved my life.
RACER X	I didn't save anything worth saving unless you get smart. Real fast. Racer talks without looking at him.
RACER X (CONT'D)	You thought you could take on the Cartel. You can't. Not without help.
KATSU	I don't know what'you're talking about.
RACER X	You won the Cortex Invitational and you weren't supposed to. You did it to save Okamoto Engineering.
KATSU	It has belonged to my family for five generations.
RACER X	And now someone else wants it. The only way you can stop it from happening is to talk to the authorities.
KATSU	There is nothing to talk about.
RACER X	You have been on cruncher Block's leash for.so long maybe you forgot how it feels to stand up and be a man. The only way you'll ever stop these people is to bring them to justice.
KATSU	Justice/ That's a commodity I don't waste money on. Racer X immediately pulls his car over.
RACER X	Get out. Wearing his smirk like a cheap suit, Katsu gets out.
KATSU	I'll see you at Fuji.
RACER X	You won't finish. When you lose, if you can still dial a phone, call this number. He hands him a card. The card reads; CHIEF INSPECTOR
KID	Sprittle is working hard on a test when he hears the
DANNY	Hey monkey-lover, show me your test or I'll kick your ass after school.
SPRITTLE	Sorry. Cheaters never prosper. The kid to the left chimes in.
MALCOM	Spriiiitle, when Chim-chim's bad, do you spank the monkey?
SPRITTLE	No, your mother does it for me. Malcom almost swallows his tongue as several other kids
TEACHER	All right! Malcom! Danny! Sprittle! To the Principal's office. March! There is a chorus of, "I didn't do it, awwww, not fair."
TEACHER (CONT'D)	Now! The bell rings and the students begin piling out. When
SPEED	Looks like someone's in trouble again.
SPEED	Want to talk about it? Sprittle shakes his head.
SPRITTLE	K-W Integral 4-door with twin-cam turbine...C-foster-K 1200, modified split-rail and supershocks...
SPEED	Was it that Stanton kid again? Did he say something? If you want to kick his butt--? He shakes his head again.
SPRITTLE	.it doesn't seem fair that I get in trouble, when they always start it.
SPEED	It's not fair. But that's what bullies do. They make the world unfair.
SPRITTLE	That sucks.
SPEED	Yes, it does.
SPRITTLE	What can I do about it?
SPEED	You ignore 'em when you can, fight 'em when you can't.
SPRITTLE	Those choices suck too.
SPEED	Yeah, but just try to keep one thing in mind.
SPRITTLE	What?
SPEED	Bullies come and go but a family can torture you forever. Chim-chim gives Sprittle a wet-willy.
SPRITTLE	Heeeeeey! Speed laughs as Chim-chim howls and then puts his arm
SPEED	But no joke, you just say the word, little brother and we got your back, right Chim-chim? Chim-chim grunts.
SPRITTLE	Thanks guys.
REMMINGTON	The new GRX has a super charged inner-positive transporter and will be capable of speeds in excess off 800 kilometers an hour. Mushi nods.
MUSHI	If such a car were to win the Grand Prix this year, one would expect the demand for transponders to increase dramatically.
REMMINGTON	One would expect.
MUSHI	And if a single company gained control of all the transponder foundries in the world, one might expect that company to do very well for itself.
REMMINGTON	You know what I want and I know that for the last few years you have been trying to buy out your main rival Tetsua Okamoto. The question is, can we make a deal? The car rotates, rising up on its mechanical arm, a
MUSHI	Deliver Okamoto at that price and the Taiobi Transponder foundry is yours.
REMMINGTON	Done. Remington smiles as they shake hands. watching the sinking sun tye-dye the sky behind the
TRIXIE	You're really considering signing with Remmington.
SPEED	I just said it was tempting.
TRIXIE	Why?
SPEED	Well, they got a really good team.. Cannonball Taylor, Markie Manifold. They win a lot of Majors.
TRIXIE	Since when did winning become so important?
SPEED	It is important. You gotta win if you want to keep driving and that's what I want to do. It's the only thing I really know how to do. When I'm driving, I feel like that's the only time my life makes sense. She moves closer to him.
TRIXIE	You mean, this doesn't make sense to you?
SPEED	Okay, besides being with you.
TRIXIE	So you like being with me?
SPEED	You know I do.
TRIXIE	Sometimes I do, sometimes I'm not so sure.
SPEED	What?
TRIXIE	Sometimes around your family, you seem distant, not like this and I wonder why.
SPEED	Come on, you know how I've felt about you since I was ten years old.
TRIXIE	I guess so, I just wish you weren't so shy about it.
SPEED	What do you want me to do? Kiss you in front of everyone at the end of a big race?
TRIXIE	Would that be so terrible?
SPEED	I don't know. Maybe we should practice first.
TRIXIE	Maybe we should. They start to kiss when they hear a muted voice.
SPRITTLE	Oh God! I'm gonna hurl! Huuuurrrl!
TRIXIE	Sprittle?
SPEED	No! Speed jumps out of the car. He did not! He throws open the trunk, revealing Sprittle and Chim-chim
SPEED (CONT'D)	Sprittle!
SPRITTLE	It wasn't my idea!
SPEED	Oh no?
SPRITTLE	It was his! He points at Chim-chim who shakes his head wildly, pointing
TRIXIE	Wait till we tell Pops.
SPRITTLE	No! Don't do that! We're sorry. We couldn't sleep. We just wanted to hang out. We didn't know you were going to In-spew-ration Point. By the way, Cootie-shots. Sprittle and Chim-chim immediately cover one shoulder
SPEED	I'm taking you home.
SPRITTLE	Wait, wait, wait-- Speed slamsâ¢the trunk shut so we hear Sprittle voice muffled
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)	Can we stop for ice cream first? He is carrying a brown paper sack.
POPS	Morning, Speed.
SPEED	Pops.
POPS	So, today's the big day. Speed nods. Pops puts down his tools.
POPS (CONT'D)	I know this is a tremendous opportunity for you.
SPEED	It could be for you too.
POPS	Could be, could be. But, regardless, this is really all about you. It' your decision and I want you to know, no matter what you decide, I'm behind you.
SPEED	Thanks, Pops. The room begins to shake.
POPS	I think your ride's here.
LIKE	Speed stares out the window, chewing on his decision
IS	Gennie greets Speed as he debarks from the plane. He
GENNIE	Speed, so nice to see you again. Her,eyes and the softness of her touch elevate flirting
GENNIE (CONT'D)	Mr. Remmington is so excited about this meeting. He hasn't talked about anything else all week. Speed sighs. Two heads pop up. Sprittle and Chim-chim are wearing cat- Sprittle carefully pulls back the latch springing the drawer. Speed arrives via the elevator and Remmington breaks into
REMMINGTON	Speed! Gennie leaves speed, returning to the elevator, as He hugs him Welcome back! Come. Sit. Sit. In the center of the room is a small cluster of extremely Above them a multifaceted skylight glitters like a cut
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Can I get you something to drink? Water? Bubbly? A shot of rye? Speed smiles sheepishly.
SPEED	No... I'm okay.
REMMINGTON	So, I can see you have given some serious thought to this thing.
SPEED	I have, yes sir.
REMMINGTON	Good. That means that you understand that we are talking about not just your future, but your family's future.
SPEED	.my family means a lot to me.
REMMINGTON	I know. I can tell. That's why this is so important. Because you can help them. All you have to say is yes. That is all I need to hear and I can make so many things happen for you, and your family. Are you ready for that? Are you ready to say yes, Speed? When they hear someone coming Sprittle manages to lift A cleaning man is rising up on a cherry picker with a
SPRITTLE	Uh-oh. He looks back at their mess.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)	jig's up. A moment later the door opens and the cleaning man enters..
CLEANING MAN	Holy cooly: He grabs for his radio.
CLEANING MAN (CONT'D)	Hey, this is Marvin down at the landing pad. I think we got mice again. As he talks, two shadows slip quietly out the door behind
SPEED	This isn't an easy decision for me, Mr. Remmington. For my family, racing is everything. We eat, drink, think and breathe racing. There is nothing more perfect than a picnic at Thunderhead. I mean, I was taught to drive before I could walk. But when my brother died, all that went away. I can't tell you how painful that was. It nearly killed all of us. Especially Pops. He didn't set foot in his shop for over a year. As the memory comes to life, we see the images in flashback. But one night when I was still pretty young. I couldn't sleep and I went into the living room and there was Pops, in his beat up robe, watching some old race recordings. The blue tv light of Speed's memory fills his eyes.
SPEED (CONT'D)	So I sat with him watching of Ben Burns coming round the last turn of he '43 Prix and all of a sudden Pops started screaming, and then I started screaming, and as Burns and Dugazi duked it out, heading for the finish, we were cheering our heads off and the second the black and white came down, we looked at each other and right there we realized the naked truth; racing is in our blood. Flashback ends. But for Pops, it isn't just a sport. It's way more important than that. It's like a religion and in our house, the Major Sponsors are kinda like the devil.
SPEED (CONT'D)	I don't mean to offend you sir and I do appreciate your offer, it's just, I guess I understand his -point of view and after all we've been through, I don't think this kind of deal is for me. Remmington chuckles.
REMMINGTON	You poor, naive, chump. He chuckles again. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that load of sickening schmaltz and I am going to give you a bit of an education. At the end of it if you're smart, you'll thank me and hen you'll sign that contract.
REMMINGTON	Look. There is the true spirit of the golden age of racing. Benjamin Braddack, Diamond Dave Tweksbury, Reginald White, Oliver Potter, and George Wheeler. The five most powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century. As he talks we flash back to jittery old footage and
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	For all intensive purposes they created the modern automotive industry. But the true stroke of their genius was the invention of the WRL, the world's first racing league. Remmington leads Speed past several personal mementos In front of an enlarged picture of Ben Burns from the Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the '43 Prix. One of the great finishes in the history of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Dugazi slugging it out, but who remembers Carl Potts? Driving a rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne . Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF. A forgettable and pathetic finish. So bad, that afterwards Iodyne stock dropped six points. Again we see the history told in flashback.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling cold fresh milk in victory lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a twelve point gain which immediately block Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a complete take-over. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of Iodyne Inc. in the exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that immediately sent Iodyne into the gains record book-- the only record book that matters. Look out that window, there isn't a single plane or helicopter or K- Harrier that isn't powered by Iodyne fuel cells. That's what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars, or drivers. All that matters is power and the unassailable might of money. His greed is as tangible as any drug. His radio buzzes "perps last seen tramway four, driving a The doors start to close when Sprittle and Chim-chim jump
REMMINGTON	Do you understand? Burns knew he was going to win. It was already decided. A week before the Prix, Goldman and Sirrus met with several other major players at the Carlyle Hotel. They met there as they had for years, just as their fathers had met, and as their sons and heirs will still meet. They met to negotiate the finish order of the Grand Prix. No race is more important and no race is more controlled. That year Goldman was supposed to win, but he knew if he sold his win to Sirrus, whatever that win might be worth, was nothing compared to what could be gained. He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	That's why I paid three million dollars for this burnt and twisted piece of metal. Because it reminds me of what really matters. This is the true heart of racing boy! This is my religion! Speed is aghast.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	You don't know how many times I have seen that same cow-eyed "say it isn't so" look of disbelief. Every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly like you do now. I won't bother proving it to you.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	If you walk away from me, if you walk out of.this deal, you'll know how true it is soon enough. So, last chance. What's it going to be, Speed? Your father's little fantasy bubble? Or are you going to join the rest of us adults, here in reality?
Several technician carts and trollies carrying auto parts	As they realize what they are looking at, a security goon
REMMINGTON	What's this? He looks and sees the shoes and suit.
SPEED	If that's your idea of racing, you can keep it.
REMMINGTON	Listen to me and listen good kid, because I'm going to give you one more history lesson. You're going to go to Fuji-- In quick, collage cuts we see -- The track weaves in and out of the lush tropical
REMMINGTON	But you won't win. You won't place. More collage cuts--
FUJI ANNOUNCER	Speed Racer's making his move, gunning for the lead--
GRAY GHOST	We got ourselves a real race here! The two cars start dancing around each other; like two
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)	Here we go, here we go. Wham. Ghost throws the first punch which Speed tries to
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)	Come on! Show me something! Show me what you got! Speed ducks down the bank, working each wheel into a
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)	Ohhhh yeah! Yeeeeeahhhhh!
FUJI ANNOUNCER	The Gray Ghost unloads a round- house, Speed counters, smashing, banging, bumping-
GRAY GHOST	Here I come, kid! Watch out. Here I am! Nope--I'm over here! Wham! Wham! Speed tries to counter punch and the Ghost
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)	You can't.touch me! I'm here! I'm gone! Speed is thrown back into the pack of cars that quickly Crunched into the wall by the Zokeo Communications car, Racer X slams into the Zokeo car, freeing Speed but
REMMINGTON DRIVER	I guarantee you right now, you won't even finish the race.
SPARKY	Speed, get out of there!
SPEED	I can't! I can't move! The two cars head toward the final jump, locked in some They lunge awkwardly, crashing on top of one another as--
REMMINGTON	Soon after that there will be litigation against some of your father's designs. A dour-faced man beneath an umbrella is waiting for them.
DOUR FACE	Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors-
POPS	Yeah, but I'm still on vacation-
DOUR FACE	You are hereby served a summons.
POPS	What?
DOUR FACE	You are being sued for IP infringement by Janus Automakers.
SPEED	That's ridiculous!
DOUR FACE	That's for a jury to decide.
REMMINGTON	The legitimacy of the lawsuits won't matter. They will be enough to discredit his company. Whatever contracts he has, he'll lose. Within a year he will be filing for bankruptcy. After that, you and the rest of your pathetic family will be history. The threat hangs in the air like a loaded gun between
SPEED	Pops was right. You are the devil. The elevator suddenly opens with the security goon
SPRITTLE	Speed!
SPEED	Sprittle?
SECURITY GOON	Mr. Remmington I caught these two snooping in a restricted area.
REMMINGTON DRIVER	Get this Racer trash out of my building.
SPEED	I'll see you at Fuji. Speed turns and heads for the elevator.
REMMINGTON DRIVER	Yes and then you'll realize that you just made the biggest mistake of your life! Close up on The Racing News that Sparky is reading from.
SPARKY	". .controversy surrounds Racer Motors now embroiled in IP litigation and while evidence remains inconclusive whether or not Speed used an illegal device, the Fuji Helexicon seems destined to become another mark of shame added to the notorious Racer family legacy, a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this beloved sport."
MOM	Sparky. That's enough.
SPARKY	Sorry ma'am.
SPRITTLE	I'm going to send that guy some Chim-chim cookies. Chim-chim guffaws.
POPS	You'll do no such thing.
SPRITTLE	We gotta do something, Pops. Speed steps into the doorway.
SPEED	This is exactly what he said would happen if I didn't drive for him.
SPARKY	You mean Remmington?
SPEED	He said it'd get worse and worse and by the end of the year you'd be filing for bankruptcy, Pops.
SPRITTLE	Okay, he's definitely gettin' some monkey cookies.
MOM	Sprittle!
POPS	He was just trying to scare you, son. They tried the same thing with Rex. If it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get.
SPEED	How? What can we do? How can we fight this? He tosses the newspaper.
POPS	The truth will come out.
SPEED	The truth? Don't be naive, Pops. He leaves. He sinks down to his bed, a sense of powerlessness Mom taps and then cracks the door.
MOM	Speed? Are you okay?
SPEED	.I don't know. She comes in and sits beside him, putting her arm around
MOM	It'll be okay. We'll get through it.
SPEED	I don't know, mom. I might have really messed things up.
MOM	How?
SPEED	By not joining Remmington.
MOM	Don't be silly. You'd have never been happy driving for that terrible man.
SPEED	But maybe racing isn't about being happy. Maybe Remmington's right and it's all about business and anyone who doesn't understand that is just a chump.
MOM	Now you listen to me, young man. What you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business. Before you could even talk, you were making noises that sounded like a car engine. We used to tell people you were speaking car-ese. We used to try to take you to the park but you never wanted to get out of the car.
SPEED	.I loved that old wagon.
MOM	And do you remember the time Rex took you out to Thunderhead and let you drive-- Speed smiles.
SPEED	And I turned it over.
MOM	My heart still pounds just thinking about it.
SPEED	Rex told me the only reason we survived was because I was wearing red socks.
MOM	I thought your father was going to have a stroke when you walked in the door with that crazy smile.
MOM	I don't think I ever saw you as happy as you were telling anybody who asked, how you lost your two front teeth in your first crash.
MOM	Speed, when I watch you do some of the things you do, I feel like I'm watching someone paint or play music. When I go to the races, I go to watch you make art and it's beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be, even though there are times when I have to close my eyes. But then there are other times, when you just take my breath away and it's at those moments, when I feel your father's chest swell and I know he's smiling, trying to pretend he doesn't have tears in his eyes, I just go to pieces.
SPEED	Why?
MOM	Because I am so impossibly proud to be your mother. And even though your father doesn't say it, he is too. She puts her arms around him.
MOM (CONT'D)	Don't worry. We'll figure this out. We just have to stick together. Something good will happen. You'll see. Ding dong. The front doorbell chimes. Behind him is Racer X. Sprittle sees the masked racer and screams. They begin running around, flailing like Chicken Little, Popsstorms into the room.
POPS	What are you two squawking about? They dive behind the couch but peek out as Pops heads for
SPRITTLE	Pops, whatever you do, don't open the door!
RACER X	This is a bad idea.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	If it was any other driver, you'd be here. Popsopens the door and Racer X sets his jaw.
POPS	Inspector Detector?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Good morning, Mr.. Racer. I know it's been a long time-- He extends his hand and Pop shakes it.
POPS	Ten years.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Yes. I'm sorry for this intrusion, but I was hoping to have a word with you and Speed. Pops eyes the masked racer.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR (CONT'D)	It's important.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	We've been after Remmington for years for dozens of capital corporate crimes including WRL fixing but we haven't had the evidence we need to convict him. Until now. Sprittle and Chim-chim peek up from behind the couch as
MOM	Here you are, Mr. X. Sprittle points at Racer X.
SPRITTLE	What's he doing here?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Racer X works closely with our WRL corporate crimes division, helping us recruit drivers like you, Speed. Most of the media, which you are now seeing is controlled by the Major Sponsors and they have done their best to paint him as a menace to the sport. The truth is he's our most valuable weapon against these villains.
SPEEED	Why does he always wear that mask?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	If any of, you actually knew his identity, you would become targets for his enemies which include some of the most vicious Fixers in the world. Gulp. They both sink back down behind the couch.
SPEED	What do you want with me?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	You're familiar with the driver Katsu Okamoto?
SPEED	Of course.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	For years he has been contracted by a Fixer named Cruncher Block who we know works for Remmington. Recently, Katsu has been forced to lose races that have led to a droop in the stock price of Okamoto Engineering. We believe this is a part of a corporate strategy to allow Mushi motors to buy control of Okamoto. Katsu doesn't want this to happen and he began resisting, thinking.that he could do it on his own. After Fuji, he realized he needed help.
POPS	,Why help him?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Because he has a file with enough information to connect Block to Remmington which could put both of them behind bars for the rest of their lives. The problem is, he won't give us the file unless we help him stop the take over of his family's company.
SPEED	How?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	There is an up-coming race that Katsu believes if he can win, it will catapult Okamoto Engineering back into the spotlight and double the cost of the buy out which should kill it.
SPEED	But there aren't any more races left except for the Grand Prix and we both failed to qualify. Inspector takes a big breath.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	There aren't any track races. This is a cross-country rally.
SPARKY	You mean The Crucible?
POPS	What?!
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	I know it seems cruel of me to ask, but Katsu made it clear that he had to have Speed an X on his team or there would be no deal.
POPS	Absolutely out of the question.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	You'll have the support of the entire C.I.B--
POPS	No! Rally racing is a back alley sport full of jackals, head- hunters and thugs! I'm sorry, Inspector but I lost one son to that death-trap. I won't lose another.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	I understand. If you change your He starts to take out his card.
POPS	Keep your card, Chief Inspector. Speed looks at Pops, then realizes that Racer X is
SPEED	And the way he was looking at me, I don't know...I just gotta do something.
TRIXIE	But Pops will never let you go.
SPEED	He won't if I ask him.
TRIXIE	Speed Racer what are you thinking?
SPEED	You weren't in Remmington's office, Trix. You don't know what it was like. It felt as though he had his hand inside my chest and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to me.
TRIXIE	I hate him. I'm picturing his heart clogging with cholesterol right now.
SPEED	No joke, Trix. If you could have been in that room, you'd want to do anything you could to take this guy down. She looks straight into his eyes and he doesn't have to
TRIXIE	All right. Let's do it. You're going to need an alibi. We'll say we're going skiing.
SPEED	What? No way!
TRIXIE	You're going to need my help. Casa Cristo is a rally. I can spot from a 'copter.
SPEED	Trixie, this isn't a game. These people play rough.
TRIXIE	I know. That's why I'm coming with you. And if you even try to argue with me, I'll tell Pops right now and he won't let you out of his sight.
SPEED	You would, wouldn't you? He looks into her eyes and knows the answer.
SPEED (CONT'D)	Well...I guess we're going skiing. She smiles. Behind them, Cannonball Taylor blasts through the test
REMMINGTON	As I'm sure you're aware, the Okamoto stock fell another four points yesterday. In the next few days it will hit bottom and they will have to sell. The car roars through its elliptical path like a circling
MUSHI	This could be a most profitable year for Remmington. Remmington can't hide the glow.
REMMINGTON	Mushi won't do too badly either. Mushi nods. Cannonball circles, everything in apparent harmony until
GENNIE.	I know this is terrible timing sir, but I've just received confirmation of several last minute entries to the Casa Cristo
REMMINGTON	Who?
GENNIE	You're not going to like it.
ANNOUNCER	We're just minutes away from the start of the 82nd annual Casa Cristo Classic, the grand dame of cross-country, the second oldest rally race in the world, spanning two continents, three climate changes and five thousand kilometers of the most winding and treacherous roads ever raced. Heturns to his colleague. With me again is five time Casa Cristo champion, Johnny "Goodboy" Jones.
JOHNNY	Always great to be here. Such a beautiful city.
ANNOUNCER	One of the most romantic cities in the world. Cruncher stands at the window balcony looking out over
BELLMAN	Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?
CRUNCHER	Yeah ...I wanna send someone a present.
ANNOUNCER	Safety has been the primary concern for Casa Cristo officials, especially the last few years.
JOHNNY	That's right Bob. There were a number of fatalities several years ago. It really had a bad reputation for a while.
ANNOUNCER	Fans started calling it "The Crucible."
JOHNNY	Most of the T-180 drivers wouldn't come near it.
ANNOUNCER	But you look today, we've got some major names like Millie "the mouse" Manno, Snake Oiler and Katsu Okamoto as well as the young rising star Speed Racer. Not to mention, the shadow that seems to hang over every major race these days, the masked racer that some fans call the Harbinger of Boom. What's your take on Racer X?
JOHNNY	Obviously he is an extremely talented and disciplined driver.
ANNOUNCER	But is he a head hunter?
JOHNNY	I think he drives like he'is not always interested in winning.
ANNOUNCER	Nuff' said.
JOHNNY	But remember Colton, these are standard road cars, not T-180s. I know a lot of T-180 drivers who I raced against who expected to win but found out racing a few laps on a track is a totally different animal than a cross-country rally.
ANNOUNCER	The marathon as opposed to the sprint?
JOHNNY	Exactly. This isn't just about going fast. It's about endurance. More than anything, winning Casa Cristo is a test of will.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Speed, I want you to understand how much the C.I.B. appreciates your help on this.
SPEED	I'm not doing this to help C.I.B. I don't know anything about corporate crimes and honestly, if I did, it wouldn't really matter. I'm doing this because someone is trying to hurt my family and I'm going to do everything I can to hurt him back. The masked racer is unable to mask his smile.
ANNOUNCER	The reason.T-180 drivers have always come to Casa Cristo is because the winner is automatically offered an invitation to the Grand Prix next week. A hold over from the days when rally racing was far more popular then track racing.
JOHNNY.	Gosh how things have changed.
SECURITY GUARD	He says it's for Horuko, from an admirer. Katsu looks at the ribboned box as the guard runs his
HORUKO	You see how we have to live? He ignores her, turning away as she starts to open it. Inside the goldfish bowl the piranha shreds a piece of
JOHNNY	To compete in this race, you really have to have a killer instinct. Any sign of weakness or timidness is like blood in the water and you'll see how fast this race turns into a feeding frenzy.
RACER X	We're going to need some insurance for this race. Minx clicks away at a keyboard while a digital Mach 5
RACER X (CONT'D)	Minx builds my cars.
SPEED	Nice to meet ya. She purrs in response. Racer X nods and she uses the computer to illustrate her

ANNOUNCER	Every race fan has heard the rumors of spearhooks, tire shanks and battery boosters.
JOHNNY	The league has done a tremendous job to clean rally racing up. While it's true there have been a few bad apples, on the'whole most teams stay within league rules. He winks into the camera.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)	Or at least try not to get caught.
POPS	Sprittle! Faster than a blink Sprittle grabs the remote and changes What are you doing?
SPRITTLE	Just watching a little TV, Pops.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)	It's his favorite show.
POPS	It's in German!
SPRITTLE	Not the monkey parts. chim-chim smiles.
POPS	Oh no you don't. You are not watching that race. Out you go. Outside. Get some exercise. You're too pale.
ANNOUNCER	The moment the Queen of Casa Cristo sees the sun, she'll signal the start of the race.
TNT. HOTEL SUITE	They speak in Japanese.
HORUKO	This is wrong.what you are trying to do.
KATSU	I have no choice. Their price is an insult to four generations of our family.
HORUKO	And if you die? Will then the price be high enough? everything for their love of this sport." Trixie stands beside Speed, both of them staring at the
SPEED	I understand it now, Trix. I know why he left us. She looks at him.
SPEED (CONT'D)	He was trying to change this rotten business and they killed him for it.
SNAKE	This is supposed to be my race! I'm supposed to win! I got the green light! They. promised I'd get to go to the Grand Prix! For eight years I've played by the rules! This is supposed to be my race!
CRUNCHER	Enough! I can't stand the whining! Like a baby needing its diaper changed. Snake works his jaw looking for the right comeback.
CRUNCHER	It's simple. We have a team of wild cards. The problem is these wild cards are better drivers than you.
SNAKE	Like hell they are!
CRUNCHER	Prove it. Take out Katsu. The other two will quit. Snake seethes.
SNAKE	You just watch me. Come on! He and his boys storm out, slamming the door behind them.
TRIXIE	Katsu, HydroCell's coming up onâ¢ your left. The HydroCell cars jostle their way towards Katsu, Speed
RACER X	I got him. Speed notices Horuko standing on the balcony and is Katsu bows.
KATSU	It is such an extraordinary honor to have such talent on my team.
RACER X	Let's skip the niceties and cut to the chase. Katsuarches an eyebrow.
RACER X (CONT'D)	The only reason we're here is because you needed two outsiders and because the Chief Inspector believes you'll turn over your. file on Remmington and Block. Racer X eyes him.
RACER X (CONT'D)	I don't believe it. I don't trust anyone who needs this kind of deal before they'll bring a criminal to justice. The accusation hangs in the air.
RACER X (CONT'D)	But I'm willing to take a chance that you'll prove me wrong.
KATSU	You won't regret your decision.
RACER X	We'll see. Until then you have my word that I will do everything.I can to make sure you checker at Bartimaeus. Katsu smiles.
KNOCKING	Racer X smashes into one of the HydroCell team, Katsu again smiles.
KATSU	Arrigato, X. Arrigato.
SPEED	If they're so desperate, why not just use some kind of sniper? There's a million places someone could hide if they were really trying to kill you.
RACER X	Any obvious crime would allow the Chief Inspector to shut the race down. That kind of scrutiny would only hurt the business. They'll do as much as they can to make it appear legit. Speed nods.
RACER X (CONT'D)	The real problem we'll have is after the: first leg. Corteges is going to be extremely dangerous. Take my advice, keep your family away from Cortega. Speed again looks out at Moruko on the balcony. They're out of the city and heading into the Zunubian Desert.
The chain of cars weave along the ribbon of concrete	In the audience, Cruncher moves up behind Billy. Billy pours out a fistful of star-dust; the glint of
TRIXIE	Speed, jump!
RACER X	He's not alone.
RACER X	This surprises me.
SPEED	Why?
RACER X	Tyrus is a good man. I wouldn't expect him to turn head-hunter. They aren't pulling any punches. Inside are the photographs of a beautiful girl playing in Cruncher smiles like a snake that has just found an egg.

RACER X	Wing left.
SPEED	Flying in! He jumps one car and blocks the attack on X.
TRIXIE	Speed! Wham! Billy slams up against him-- Throwing a lever, a grappler locks on to the Mach 5.
SPEED	He's got me! I'm locked up! Another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved

JOHNNY	I know he blew up at Fugi, but this kid is flat out magic! Pops walks up.
POPS	I've got to go into town for some parts. I'll be back for lunch.
SPRITTLE	Sure thing Pops. Pops looks at them, shakes his head and walks off.
HIM	Sprittle slowly lowers his tanning goggles to watch
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)	Let's go! They drop their mirrors and bolt for the house. They start crunching away, oblivious to the sound of the

POPS (CONT'D)	Sprittle! He sees the race on tv.
POPS (CONT'D)	You two are in--
SPRITTLE	Wait! Pops, before you get mad at us--Look! Sprittle points at the tv eyes wide.
POPS	I'm not falling for that--
SPRITTLE	It's Speed!
POPS	Speed's skiing.
SPRITTLE	Then who's driving the Mach 5? Pops turns and indeed, there's the Mach 5 barrelling
POPS	Oh no. We're nearing the end of the first leg of the Casa Cristo as Snake Oiler, lead driver for the HydroCell team, roars through the streets of Cortega, heading for the finish.
ANNOUNCER	The HydroCell team jumped on the lead early and would not give it up.
JOHNNY	They made excellent time. Okamoto is still a couple of minutes behind them.
ANNOUNCER	They have their work cut out for them tomorrow.
KATSU	If we drive tomorrow like we drove today we will lose! He points at the masked racer.
KATSU (CONT'D)	You will get nothing! All of this will be meaningless!
SPEED	Relax. Snake's weak on turns. We'll catch him in the mountains.
KATSU	We might if you stop showing off.
SPEED	Hey, all I was doing was saving your ass. Katsu raises a fist, but Racer X catches it.
RACER X	Don't fall apart yet. There's still a lot of race to run. Katsu jerks free of Racer X and storms towards the door
RACER X (CONT'D)	A C.I.B. Man will be posted outside your door. We got their attention today. You and Trixie should be very careful tonight. Speed nods as Racer X heads for the door.
SPEED	Racer X-- He stops.
SPEED (CONT'D)	I thought we made a good team today. It felt like we'd been doing it for a long time. He hesitates.
RACER X	If you say so. He turns away leaving Speed alone.
CHICKEN'S	Remmington wrings the phone as if it were a neck.
REMMINGTON	Ineptitude? Is this what I pay you for?
CRUNCHER	They ain't checkered yet.
REMMINGTON	If. they do, I assure you it will be a very costly mistake for everyone. He hangs up.
ASSISTANT	Mr. Remmington, you have Mr. Mushi on line two. Remmington was dreading this call. He hits the button.
REMMINGTON	Mr. Mushi--
MUSHI	So, is this what guarantee means to you, Mr. Remmington? Perhaps your dictionary has a different definition.
REMMINGTON	I understand there is a problem, but I assure you there is no need to panic.
MUSHI	I am not calling to panic. I am calling to inform you that we will be addressing the problem ourselves, as your assurances and guarantees leaves much to be desired. He hangs up leaving Remmington to stew in his juice.
SPEED	It was very weird, Trix. I knew every move he was going to make and he knew mine. It was so familiar. Maybe I'm crazy but Racer X first showed up two years after Rex's death.
TRIXIE	But Speed, Rex was cremated.
SPEED	A body was cremated. Remember it had already been badly burned in the crash. Even if it was Rex, no one could have recognized him.
TRIXIE	So you think he faked the crash with a different body in the driver's seat?
SPEED	Somehow the kwik-save was disconnected. Inspector Detector suspected foul play but nothing could be proved.
TRIXIE	okay, let's say it's all true. Why would we do it?
SPEED	I don't know. Maybe the same reason I'm here. Ding dong. Speed goes to the door.
C.I.B. SECURITY MAN	I'm sorry to disturb you sir, but do you know these people? Speedsticks his head out and there they are--
SPEED	Yeah...
POPS	Is this the kind of driver I have? Someone who disobeys? Someone who lies to me? Is this the kind of son I have raised? And you, Trixie, you know what this race did to this family. Did either of you stop to think about us? Huh? Speed, did you think about your mother? Or your brother? What it would do if something happened to you?
SPEED	That's all I've been thinking about, Pops. You, Mom, Sprittle, Sparky. Chim-chim shouts.
SPEED (CONT'D)	Yeah, you too, Chim-chim. We are in serious trouble,,Pops, and it's all my fault.
POPS	This is not the place or the race to do anything about that.
SPEED	Why not?
POPS	Because it won't do any good?
SPEED	You don't know that.
POPS	You think you can drive a car and change the world?! It doesn't work like that!
SPEED	Maybe not. But it's the only thing I know how to do and I gotta do something.
POPS	That's unacceptable! This is over. Pack your things. We're going home. Speed has never directly disobeyed his father.
SPEED	I can't. I'm sorry, Pops.
POPS	What?!
SPEED	I'm staying.
TRIXIE	So am
POPS	No you're not! You're coming home, right now!
SPEED	I'm not a child, Pops. You can't tell me how to live my life. If you want to fire me as your driver, then fine, do it. But it won't change the fact that I am going to.finish this race. Pops looks ready to have an aneurism.
POPS	God, you sound like Rex. Do you want to die like him too? Will that make you happy?
SPEED	Don't take it out on me because you feel guilty for what happened to Rex.
MOM	okay, you two. That's enough. Pops, if they're staying, then we're staying.

POPS	Sparky. Pops and Sparky leave to do their work.
SPEED	I'm sorry, Mom.

TRIXIE	Cool beans. There is a hurried knock at the door.
POPS	I'll get it. It is Horuko, surrounded by security.
HORUKO	Oh, I am sorry. I was looking for Speed Racer. Speed moves to the door.
SPEED	Horuko? Are you all right?
HORUKO	No. Something terrible has happened. The family is gathered around them and Racer X, who is Racer X tastes the needle of the blow dart.
RACER X	Narcolyte Benzamine. A highly effective and debilitating drug.
RACER X (CONT'D)	Stays in the system for hours, but leaves with no trace.
KATSU	I'll be...fine...by morning...
RACER X	No you won't. You can't drive a car. You can barely stand up. Katsu leaps to his feet.
KATSU	You do not tell me what I can do-- He suddenly collapses to the floor.
KATSUL	She tries to help him, but he is unconscious.
SPEED	What are we going to do? They all look to each other for an answer, but no one

THUG	Yeah, boss. Signal's loud and clear. On the dash is a GPS map with a blinking signal.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	They're airborne? You're sure? Good. Double the guard for her arrival in Bartimaeus. I gave my word nothing would happen to his sister and I mean to keep it. The Inspector gets another call.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR (CONT'D)	Inspector Detector..-.Mrs. Racer? What kind of emergency? He stands and pulls out a gun. It is Cruncher Block.
SPEED	Left! Drift tight! Tight! Okamoto looks like he's about to go over the edge.
SPEED (CONT'D)	No!
CRUNCHER	Don't do it! They raise their hands.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	On the ground! Now! They get on.the floor. Horuko stands and Cruncher whips his gun around to her. But suddenly, something is wrong, his eyes going wide as Horuko is not Horuko. Horuko is Katsu. What the-- Katsu snatches Cruncher's gun and the Fixer is too
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	You-cheater. The security team seizes hold of him.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	But if you're here, who's--?
TRIXIE	That's better. Couldn't see anything. She gains control and eases the car into the slot.
SPARKY	That's it. Nice line, Trix.
SPARKY	Top of the hill's coming. Snake's got at least a quarter mile'on ya.
TRIXIE	Well, let's go get him.
SPEED	If you'd been a little more careful, he wouldn't be ahead of us.
TRIXIE	I told you I couldn't see outta this dang helmet. It's too big.
SPEED	I can't believe you talked us into this ridiculous idea.
TRIXIE	What's ridiculous about it? You're the one always telling me I'm a better driver than most of the WRL.
SPEED	Now's not the time to prove it!
TRIXIE	Why not?
SPEED	It's too dangerous!
TRIXIE	Too dangerous for me but not for you?
RACER X	Children, focus! If we're going to have a chance we're going to have to pass Snake before the rendezvous.
TRIXIE	I'm ready. Let's roll. She floors it, pulling out, leaving Speed shaking his They smear through a hairpin turn and as they close on They are attacking.

JOHNNY	You kiddin' me? He just tore Snake a new tailpipe!
SPEED	Trix? You all right? She's obviously shaken up.
TRIXIE	Yeah, sure. 10--4 and ready for more. Speed shakes his head, wanting this to be over.
RACER X	Then let's move it. We got some time to eat up.
CRUNCHER	Haven't ya heard? Cheaters never prosper.
SECURITY GUARD	Sir, we've got the lead! They're heading for the rendezvous, now! Katsu looks back at Cruncher and smiles.
KATSU	Excellent.
THUG	Somethin' ain't right.
HORUKO	You're sure, no cameras here?
POPS	Checked it this morning. Quite a few dead spots in these mountains.
SPEED	I told you-- She turns ready to fight, if that's what he wants.
SPEED (CONT'D)	You are one helluva driver. She smiles.
TRIXIE	You're not so bad yourself. Sparky and Pops go to work, changing fuel cells and
RACER X	What's he doing here?
KATSU	Stowaway. Weren't sure what to do with him.
RACER X	Do what he'd do; break his legs and let him walk back. Horuko bows to Trixie.
HORUKO	Thank you so much.
TRIXIE	It was a blast.

CRUNCHER	The new plan-- what was it, again? Break your legs, make you.walk back? I like that. He stands smiling in front of Racer X.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)	But first, I think it's time to play a little peek-a-boo, I-see- you.
C.C. ANNOUNCER	We are still waiting for the Okamoto team to come out of the pass.

SPRITTLE	Ahhhh! He and Chim-chim run behind Speed.
SPEED	Sprittle this isn't a game. You could've been killed in there.
SPRITTLE	I.know it was bad! I know we shouldn't have done it. But Chim- chim was really really scared.
SPEED	Chim-chim?
SPRITTLE	Okay, I was a little scared too.
TRIXIE	Scared of what? Sprittle clings to his big brother.
SPRITTLE	I didn't want what happened to Rex to happen to you. Racer X and Pops feel a hidden wound open.

REMMINGTON	Get me... Tetsuya Okamoto.
KATSU	We make a good team.
RACER X	We did our part. Make sure you do yours. Racer X stares at Katsu whose face is as expressionless
KATSU	Of course.
REMMINGTON	Congratulations Mr. Okamoto. Very impressive race.
OKAMOTO	Yes, thank you. You are very generous, Mr. Remmington. Speed, does this mean you've signed with Okamoto?
SPEED	Uh, no. This was... a mutually beneficial opportunity.
KATSU	Yes, well put.
REPORTER 3	Katsu, does this mean you will be running in the Grand Prix this weekend?
KATSU	We'll see. Right now I'm just going to enjoy this victory.
OKAMOTO	The price is 78 a share.
REMMINGTON	That's outrageous! The price is barely above 50! This is extortion! Blackmail! I'll sue you! Tie up every asset you own up for the next 20 years!
OKAMOTO	As you wish Mr. Remmington. Have a nice day.
REMMINGTON	Wait! He grinds his molars until they are smooth.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	Seventy-eight a share. I'll have the papers drawn up.
OKAMOTO	A pleasure doing business with you.

SPARKY	I don't get it. What just happened?
POPS.	Okamoto played us for chumps. All he wanted was our help to drive up the stock on his family's company. Even if there was a file, he had no intention of turning it over.

SPEED	X? Racer X? There is a small movement in the car, a shuddering as Racer X?!! He runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes
RACER X	Jeezus, kid. You can drive. I haven't been thrown like that in years.
SPEED	What are you doing here?
RACER X	The inspector told me what happened., I came looking for you.
SPEED	Why?
RACER X	Thought you'd take it hard and maybe do something stupid.
SPEED	Why would you care?
RACER X	Because you're a fighter. And a friend.
SPEED	Why don't you just tell me the truth? Racer X stares at him hard.

SPEED (CONT'D)	You're... not Rex.
RACER X	No. I'm sorry Speed but your brother is dead. He pulls his mask back on.
SPEED	I'm sorry.
RACER X	Don't be. I'm sure where ever your brother is, he is immensely proud of you.
SPEED	For what? Making the same mistakes he did?
RACER X	For trying to make a difference. From what I've read, that's all he tried to do.
SPEED	And what good did it do? He got killed for nothing. Racing hasn't changed and it never will!
RACER X	It doesn't matter if racing never changes. What matters is if we let racing change us. Everyone of us has to find the reason to do this. You don't climb into a T- 180 to be a driver. You do it because you're driven.
SPEED	I don't know why I'm doing it anymore.
RACER X	That's obvious. At Fuji, you were trying to prove something. At Cristo, you were looking for justice. Neither are the reason you belong behind a steering wheel.
SPEED	If you know so much, why don't you tell me why I should keep driving?
RACER X	Sorry. That's for you to figure out. He climbs back into his car.
RACER X (CONT'D)	I just hope when you do, I'm there. to see it. He roars away leaving Speed alone. Sprittle opens the door, Chim-chim following him in.
SPRITTLE	Hey watcha doin?
SPEED	What's it look like?
SPRITTLE	Where ya goin?
SPEED	I don't know. I just gotta get away from here.
SPRITTLE	Why?
SPEED	Because.
SPRITTLE	Because why?
SPEED	Because I have to.
SPRITTLE	Can we come with you? Speed is struck by an odd sense of deja vu.
SPEED	What?
SPRITTLE	Can we come with you?
SPEED	No.
SPRITTLE	Why?
SPEED	You'll understand when it's your turn. He shoulders his bag and shoves out the door.
there,	Speed crosses to the door but Pops is already
POPS	Speed, before you go, I'd like to say a few things. Will you sit with your old man for a minute? Speed chafes a bit but drops his bag.
SPEED	Don't try to stop me.
POPS	I won't. I made a mistake trying to tell you what to do at Cortega. You were right. I was wrong. I won't make that mistake again. Speed sits.
POPS (CONT'D)	I want you to know that I acted rashly. I said things I wish I hadn't. Your mother usually protects me from making an ass out of my self but I was determined to do it this time and I guess I did a pretty good job of it. I wanted to make sure you understood how sorry I was.
SPEED	Thanks.
POPS	The truth was, I couldn't have been more proud of you son. Not because you won, but because you stood up, you weren't afraid and you did what you thought was right.
SPEED	So? It didn't amount to anything. It was completely meaningless.
POPS	How could it be meaningless? I saw my son become a man. I watched him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off of every driver on the road. This is not meaningless. This is the reason for a father's life. Pop's eyes'begin to twinkle with tears I admit I went to Cortega because I was afraid that what happened to Rex was going to happen to you. And I just couldn't take that. I couldn't loose another one of my boys like that again. But what I realize in Cortega was that I didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I lost him here. I lost him when he walked out of this house and I let him go without telling him how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. I let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to me than he did. You'll never know how much I regret that mistake, but it's enough that I'll never make it again. He puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him.
POPS (CONT'D)	I love you Speed. I understand that every child leaves home but I want you to know that door is always open and you can always come back.
SPEED	I love you Pops. I'm just so confused right now. I don't what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I'm locked up in some kinda tailspin and no direction makes sense.
POPS	I know what that's like. When Rex died I didn't even. know if I wanted salt on my eggs, let alone if I wanted to keep building cars. Then, do you remember when we sat here, that night, watching old Ben Burns and Dugazi? You remember that? Speednods vaguely.
POPS (CONT'D)	Sittin' here, cheering with you, something just clicked, like a light being switched on inside of me and after that, I never had trouble remembering how I liked me eggs.
SPEED	Jeez Pops. That's just it. That's part of my problem.
POPS	What?
SPEED	That race. The '43 Prix. Burns and Dugazi? It was fixed. Remmington told me the whole story. It was all about some DNF names Rotts. They've known the winner of every Grand Prix for the past 50 years. It's always fixed. That's a tough pill for Pops to swallow.
POPS	I don't believe that. Remmington's a crook. You can't believe a crook.
SPEED	I don't think he was lying, Pops.
POPS	The Grand Prix? A sham? Ding dong.
POPS (CONT'D)	Who could that be?
WITH	Speed opens the door. She seems to glow, radiating
SPEED	Horuko?!
HORUKO	Forgive me for intruding but I had to come before it was too late. Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another
HORUKO (CONT'D)	This is not a trick. I swear to you. I am not my brother.
POPS	You going to ask the lovely lady in?
SPEED	Yeah, sure. Come on in. She steps in, looking somewhat out of place in the
POPS	Can I get you something to drink?
HORUKO	No. My security man believes I am still at the opera, so I only have a moment. She turns to Speed.
HORUKO (CONT'D)	I am very sorry for what happened. what my father and brother did was not right and I am ashamed.
SPEED	It's fine. Just another lesson learned.
HORUKO	No.. It is they who are in need of a lesson. She pulls an envelope out of her bag and gives it to This rightfully belongs to you. He opens the envelope and his eyes immediately light up.
SPEED	An invitation to compete in the 91st annual Grand Prix?
HORUKO	My brother was planning to decline anyway but I studied the rules very carefully and as a member of the Okamoto team, if you present this invitation on the day of the race, they must allow you to compete. Pops bursts into a smile and slaps Speed on the back.
POPS	Whaddya think of that, Mr. Its- Always-Fixed?
HORUKO	You do not have to say anything. I only hope you drive as you did in Casa Cristo and you wipe the smiles from their faces.
POPS	We don't have a car. Sparky!
SPARKY	Right here Pops. Sparky steps out of the kitchen doorway.
POPS	What're you doing in the kitchen?
SPARKY	Same as everyone else. Behind him the entire family peeks out.
SPEED	I don't believe it. You were listening the whole time? Trixie goes to him.
TRIXIE	We were worried about you.
HORUKO	I would say good luck Saturday but you do not need it. You are already very lucky to have such a family.
SPEED	Goodbye and thank you. He closes the door.
POPS	Come on! We got work to do.
SPARKY	But Pops, the race is less than 36 hours away.
POPS	Isn't that how fast Remmington said he could build that tin can with all his fancy machines?
SPARKY	Yeah. Then we'll do it in 32. Let's go! He heads for the garage, Sprittle leaping after him.
SPRITTLE	I want to help.
POPS	Well come on.
SPRITTLE	Chim-chim too?
POPS	We need everyone. The framework of a car begins to materialize, assembled
REMMINGTON	GRX is revealed at the Grand Prix and then captures the black and white checkers the demand for our transponder engines will go through the roof. Mushi.smiles. The car is further along, but still a long way from Preparations are well under way, ads being positioned,
SPARKY	Alright, fire it up! Everyone holds their breath as Speed hits the ignition.
SPARKY (CONT'D)	Kill it! Kill it!
REMMINGTON	Ladies and gentlemen, behold the future. It's black, shiny, and beautiful in a malefic way.
SPEED	Sparks, it's getting late.
SPARKY	I know, I know. Okay. Give it a try. Everyone braces as Speed hits the ignition.
SPEED	Sounds beefy Pops.
POPS	It gives you a little something extra.
SPEED	Let's get it loaded!
CASS JONES	This year marks a new record as the Grand Prix will be broadcast in eighty-four different languages. The camera pans. over the multitude of ethnic
CASS JONES (CONT'D)	Just gets bigger every year, doesn't it Ben?
BEN BURNS	Seems like it. The Okamotos raise their glasses to Mushi.
CASS JONES	We've got an incredible lineup this year. Some major competition. We got a few fan favorites like the Gray Ghost, Sonic "Boom-boom" Renaldi and Prince Kabala. We got perenial powerhouses like Nitro Venderhoss, Gary "Gearbox" Kalinkov, and Mori Minimoto.
BEN BURNS	Not to mention C ball.
FUJI ANNOUNCER	Cannonball Taylor, fastest Grand Prix seed in history, driving the new ORX from Remmington Racecars.
BEN BURNS	She looks mighty tight.
FUJI ANNOUNCER.	There is an odd numbered field today, nineteen, one shy of a full boat as Katsu Okamoto declined his automatic invitation after winning the Casa Cristo.
BEN BURNS	Hey there's something going on down there.
CASS JONES	We're seeing some kind of commotion down at the trailer entrance. One of them starts to shake his head when he hears--
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Is there a problem here, officer?
TNT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE	Remmington is in his element, everything seeming to go
GENNIE	Sir, we have a problem.
REMMINGTON	What madness is going on here?
SENIOR RACE OFFICIAL	Mr. Remmington, this is a legitimate invitation. We have verified it.
REMMINGTON	Where did you get that?
SPEED	I was on the Okamoto team remember? I won it fair and square.
REMMINGTON	This is preposterous! He can't be allowed to race. It's too late.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	The ruling on this is quite clear. Try to stop it and you'll be in blatant violation of the WRL charter, leaving me no option but to shut this years Prix down until a full investigation can be completed.
REMMINGTON	What?! Do you have any idea what that would cost? Are you insane?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Try me. Remmington stews then spits a threat at Speed.
REMMINGTON	You'll regret this.
SPEED	Doubt it.
CASS JONES	Something big is going on because every race official has been-- wait, wait. An announcement is being made. A new driver is being added to the field.
BEN BURNS	
BLEEP.	Ben Burns gets bleeped by the network censors.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER VOICE	Now driving in the twentieth and final position, Speed Racer. The roar from the crowd shakes the windows of-- Horuko allows herself the faintest smile.
REMMINGTON	A million dollars to the driver that takes Racer out.
CANNONBALL	He won't get out of the blocks.
REMMINGTON	I prefer him to not even make it out of the locker room. Cannonball smiles as Remmington starts to turn.
REMMINGTON (CONT'D)	We're installing a spear hook on the GRX.
CANNONBALL	I don't need one to beat that punk.
REMMINGTON	A precaution.
SPEED	Oh no... The Gray Ghost cuts him off.
GRAY GHOST	
SPEED	The Gray Ghost...
GRAY GHOST	Just wanted to say good luck. He reaches out to shake, then whispers.
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)	There's a million dollar bounty on your head.
SPEED	A million dollars? Wow. Maybe I should take myself out.
GRAY GHOST	Watch yourself. Your ruffling some pretty major feathers here.
SPEED	Why aren't you after the bounty?
GRAY GHOST	Our little dance at Fuji--that's how it should always be.
CASS JONES	As the cars take to the field you can feel the anticipation mounting in the audience. Something is different. There is an electricity in the air. The presence of Speed Racer has completely changed the equation. A dressed and helmeted driver heads straight at him but
RACER X	Speed Racer? Speed turns, taking a moment to realize the handsome
SPEED	Oh, yeah.
PLAYBOY/RACER X	I'm quite a fan of yours and just wanted to say how glad I am to see you here. As they shake hands, Racer X realizes that something is
PLAYBOY/RACER X (CONT'D)	Is something wrong?
SPEED	I just... I got this thing... its stupid, I know, a superstition, but I guess all of us got one.
PLAYBOY/RACER X	Can I help? Speed suddenly notices the red trim of his tuxedo and his There is a dizzying onslaught of giant advertisements and
CASS JONES	There he is now, Speed Racer, perhaps the biggest wild card in Grand Prix history.
Floating camera blimps seem to hover everywhere including	Catching him unawares with a gaper's mouth.
TRIXIE	Look! There's Speed!
CASS JONES	Speed Racer gets his first eyeful of the Coliseum.
BEN	This ain't Kansas baby! He sees Speed helping Sparky push the Mach 5 into place.
PRINCE	Hey, mouth-breather, get used to He shows Speed his ass. 'Cause that's what you're going to be looking at all day! Speed tries to ignore him and the other driver's staring
SPARKY	Howya feelin'? Speed takes a breath as he dares to look around again.
SPEED	.it's big.
SPARKY	Hey, this cockpit is the exact same size it was at Thunderhead.
SPEED	Right.
SPARKY	Just wanted to say, thanks, for what could be the most exciting moment of my life.
SPEED	Couldn't have gotten here without you. He hugs him.
SPARKY	I'm looking forward to that cold milk.
SPEED	Me too. Speed climbs in as the speaker system blares--
FEMALE ANNOUNCER VOICE	Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. The engines erupt, crashing against the waves of the Inside the Mach 5 everything goes completely silent.
CASS JONES	The final countdown has begun and a stillness has fallen over this stadium as all eyes turn to one car.
BEN BURNS	This ain't a race. It's a showdown. The gun sounds-- The cars become bullets hurdled forward, except for the
PATH--	He tries to avoid it but can't, rear-ending him while the
CASS JONES	Trouble at the start, a misfire traps Speed Racer, causing a
BEN BURNS	Uh-oh. Look out!
CASS JONES	I don't know how he got out of that one--
BEN BURNS	That-kid's wiley. He uses their aggressiveness throwing them into each other--
CASS JONES	Speed fakes left, jumps right--
BEN BURNS	Nice, nice--
CASS JONES	He slips in behind Gearbox---
BEN BURNS	Here comes over under-- Both cars going boom-boom, their rubber cocoons bouncing
BEN BURNS	I told you! I told you!
CASS JONES	Speed Racer seems unstoppable, moving up from dead last, nearing the leaders as they head into the slalom with the Gray Ghost battling Prince Kabala and Cannonball Taylor for the lead.
GRAY GHOST	Where am I? Where am I? I'm here. I am over there. I'm Savior Faire! The Prince tries to block the Ghost but he can't seem to
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)	I'm everywhere, baby! Wham! The Ghost is on him, pouncing, slipping into what
CONTINUED:	The two more cocoons bounce onto the road as the other
CASS JONES	A spectacular crash as the Prince's jewel-covered Gigerbon worth an estimated 22 million dollars is scattered over a quarter mile of track.
BEN BURNS	I'd like to work clean up on that crash. They chuckle.
CASS JONES	But look out, as they approach the Big Drop, here comes Speed Racer? Speed presses the accelerator, making his move-- The green Mushi motors car, the Gray Ghost, and the Black
CASS JONES	Speed Racer is knocking on the door of the new GRX driven by Cannonball Taylor.
BEN BURNS	You hoot Anybody home?
SPEED	Ok Mr. Two Time Grand Prix, Five time WRL, future Hall of Fame, teach me something. Bouncing Cannonball into the wall.
SPEED	Come on! Is that it? He swerves back and the two cars begin to battle but it
CASS JONES	Cannonball Taylor is in trouble.
BEN BURNS	Tear `em up kid!
REMMINGTON	Do it. Stop him. Stop him now.
SPEED	Lesson's over. See you at the finish line. Speed slides into Cannonball to throw him but as he does-- Cannonball throws a hidden switch and under the two cars Speed feels it and knows what happened immediately. No!
SPARKY	What is it?
SPEED	Spear hook! He's got me! Cannonball slows driving both cars into the wall,
CASS JONES	Cannonball has Speed pinned as they grind through the butterfly turn.
SPRITTLE	That cheater! He's using a spear hook! SPEAR HOOK! SPEAR HOOK! The surrounding crowd becomes uncomfortable.
POPS	Sprittle, we don't know that.
SPRITTLE	I do! Cannonball Taylor is nothing but a big cheater! The paint is scraped first from the outside of the Mach 5
BEN BURNS	This is going to be ugly. Revealing the undercarriage and the hidden spear hook to The crowd gasps.
SPRITTLE	Told you so! Chim-chim high fives him.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)	Cheaters never prosper!
CASS JONES	Cannonball clearly using a spear hook.
BEN BURNS	That could cost him the Hall of Fame.
CASS JONES	Not to mention what it might do to Remmington Industries.
BEN BURNS	Shame on them.

SPARKY	Oh no, come on, don't do this.
POPS	Don't quit on us now baby.
RACER X	Careful. Listen to it. Don't kill the starter. What do you need? Something makes him put the car in second gear. He steps The crowd screams to the wail of burning rubber.
CASS JONES	He's back in it, but less than a lap and a half, I don't know what kind of chance he has.
BEN BURNS	Come on kid! Move it! He's a half-lap behind the entire field but every eye in Thunders by, rattling the elaborate lace work of concrete Gaining, inch by inch, foot by foot.
CASS JONES	Look at the split! He's shattering the lap record.
BEN BURNS	Don't mean a thing without those checkers. Where they ease over the edge, Speed hurls out, going outside the Mach 5 a maelstrom of violent chaos churns Inside, Speed is perfectly at pease.
CASS JONES	No hesitation, nothing fazes him, no one seems capable of stopping him.
BEN BURNS	This kid ain't just driving--he's on a mission.
REMMINGTON	Stop him! Stop him! By the end of the slalom, he is back where he left off, Mushi motors and the Gray Ghost.
GRAY GHOST	Welcome back kid. Been lonely up here without you.
CASS JONES	With a quarter lap to go Speed Racer is back, two cars beneath him and destiny. He. sees images and hears voices, flashing through his The montage finishes with the image of Speed as a ten
GRAY GHOST	Oh yeah, here we go, here we go. Speed flashes one way, then another, moving in ghost-like What's this? What's this? Hey now! That's my move!

CASS JONES	It's a pandemonium! People have gone completely crazy! In fourteen years we've never seen anything like this!
BEN BURNS	It's a whole new world baby, a whole new world.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	He did it. Racer X lowers his binos and turns to the inspector.
RACER	Yes, he did.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	This could change everything.
RACER X	It already has.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	My men are bringing the family down. Do you want to go with them?
RACER X	He turns and takes Minx by the arm.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR	Can I ask you a question? Do you ever think you made a mistake, hiding the truth from them? There is a flash of images as we glimpse the truth;
RACER X	If I did, then it's a mistake I have to live with. He walks away while--- The Racer family is led through the swarm of
