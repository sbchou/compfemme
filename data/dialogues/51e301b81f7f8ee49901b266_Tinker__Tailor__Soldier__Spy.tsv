CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
MAGYAR	And porkolts. You know porkolts?
JIM PRIDEAUX	Yes, I've had it.
MAGYAR	It's very good. Better than goulash. But you won't get it in Budapest now.
JIM PRIDEAUX	Why's that?
MAGYAR	All the pigs have gone to Moscow.
JIM PRIDEAUX	When do I get to meet your friend?
MAGYAR	I'll take you to him. Not eating? expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee
JIM PRIDEAUX	Would you excuse me a moment?
KGB MAN	No firing!
KGB MAN (CONT'D)	Who told you to fire? Who told you to fucking fire?
KGB MAN (CONT'D)	Fucking Hungarian amateur! We wanted him alive! Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the
PERCY ALLELINE	I wish I could have done more, Control.
CONTROL	You did all you could, Percy. (Beat) Well, a man should know when to leave the party.
TOBY ESTERHASE	What about Smiley?
CONTROL	Smiley is leaving with me. Alleline and the Lieutenants are waiting for them. A
BILL HAYDON	You little prick Esterhase. Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands
POLYAKOV	Shall we begin?
LACON	This is private property. Who are you?
RICKI TARR	Minister Lacon.
LACON	What do you want?
RICKI TARR	I want to talk to Control. And I want breakfast.
PETER GUILLAM	Has that been cleared?
BILL HAYDON	I'm not bloody chaining it outside. Mind you, probably no safer in here, with you bunch of cut-throats.
HAYDON	Thought I'd get a glimpse of the new girl. Before Bland gets to her. He seen her yet?
GUILLAM	Oh yes. Down first thing.
HAYDON	You may fuck me, Belinda, but you still have to call me sir in the morning.
POOL PLAYER (O.S.)	Sorry Peter.
PETER GUILLAM	Peter Guillam...
SMILEY	Hello, Peter.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Have I time to change?
SMILEY	Are we going far?
LACON	How's your mother?
PETER GUILLAM	Very well. Is this where he got out?
LACON	Mmm, I came back in and it was wide open. Do send her my love. Apologies for singling you out, but... very sensitive matter...
LACON (CONT'D)	If one can't trust one's own nephew... You know who he was?
PETER GUILLAM	Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention.
LACON	Why is he on the wanted list?
PETER GUILLAM	He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut his throat. Been on the run since then.
LACON	My God. In my own home... my family... The bloody animals you people employ!
LACON	And how are you George? Missing one's work, one's buddies?
SMILEY	Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you. Behind them, unnoticed, young JACKIE creeps back into the
LACON	Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in the pink, and so on.
SMILEY	Very well. (Beat) Very bonny...
LACON	Do you know this man Tarr?
SMILEY	I recruited him actually. In Penang. Good with women. Likes to talk. What did he say to you?
LACON	He said he had some intelligence for Control. Had no idea he was dead. The news obviously hadn't reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus. If he couldn't have a Minister, he would settle for the Under-secretary. Lucky me. He said there's a mole. Right at the top of the Circus. And that he's been there for years.
LACON	I was sad to see you go, George. I thought it was shabby, very shabby.
LACON (CONT'D)	But the Minister agreed with Sir Percy. New broom, clean sweep, wheat from the chaff and all that. And to be fair, Percy has had some marvellous results since you and Control left... Anyway, it does mean you're rather ideally placed to look into this matter for us now, doesn't it? Outside the family?
SMILEY	I am retired, Oliver.
LACON	Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion.
LACON (CONT'D)	He never mentioned his suspicions to you?
SMILEY	No.
LACON	I just thought... with you being "his man", so to speak.
SMILEY	What did you say to him?
LACON	I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down. That does happen in your business. And that bloody mess in Budapest...
LACON (CONT'D)	Damn it, George, this is your generation, your legacy! If there's any truth in this you'd think you'd want to...
SMILEY	I'll keep Peter Guillam. And there's a retired special branch man. Mendel. I'd like to have him.
LACON	Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping. Good man.
LACON (CONT'D)	Damn thing cost a fortune. Three years of lessons and all I hear is Edelweiss. You and Ann never had children, did you?
SMILEY	No, we never did. A stow-away BEE appears from somewhere and begins to buzz
MRS POPE GRAHAM	It's Georgian, I shouldn't lend it to you but since Mister Mendel recommends you...
MRS POPE GRAHAM (CONT'D)	You will love it for me won't you? It belonged to Mister Pope- Graham.
MENDEL (O.S.)	My friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope- Graham, no disturbances.
MRS POPE GRAHAM	And that's what he shall have. You want anything you can ask Norman, can't he, Norman?
MENDEL	Her real name is plain Graham. Added the Pope for a touch of class.
MENDEL (CONT'D)	Best informant I ever had.
SMILEY	Control lived with his sister didn't he?
MENDEL	Basingstoke. Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine. His pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in West London.
GUILLAM	We should...
MENDEL	... Webb and Bryson are the letting agents. Properties in half of the west end judging by this list...
SMILEY	We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year.
MENDEL	A Miss Hilliard. L. Cavaleri? D Weaver, M Crowley, M Cushing. F. Farling. G. Hiaasen.
MENDEL (CONT'D)	A Mrs Hawcombe. R. Kee. M. Kass. H Staunton...
MENDEL (CONT'D)	K. Menzies...
SMILEY	How long was H. Staunton a tenant?
MENDEL	Still is. Been renting for a few years now. Something?
SMILEY	Howard Staunton. Control used to say he was England's greatest chess master. Died in eighteen seventy- four. The rest of the room is mounded with PILES AND PILES OF
TOBY ESTERHASE	Help you with something Bill?
BILL HAYDON	Looking for his Majesty.
TOBY ESTERHASE	He's walking the battlements.
BILL HAYDON	Much obliged.
ALLELINE	Roy.
BLAND	It's the Yanks. They want to come in and talk. Alleline continues to stare out over the world, but allows
ALLELINE	Of course they do. We have Witchcraft. And they don't.
SMILEY	Thank you. Anywhere will do.
MENDEL	That enough for you to be getting on with?
SMILEY	No. Peter, I need you to do something for me...
Close on the documents as Guillam silently photographs	
SMILEY (V.O.)	I want to see the records of staff recently retired. While you're there get the handbook on staff duties... and the diagram of the Circus's reorganization under Alleline...
KASPAR	Sorry Peter, didn't know you were doing... whatever you were doing...?
PETER GUILLAM	Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you?
ROY BLAND	Heard you had an accident.
PETER GUILLAM	Cut it on a drawer handle. some new furniture round here?
ROY BLAND	I'll have a word with Esterhase, Peter. We'll make it a priority on the top floor.
ROY BLAND (CONT'D)	Where are you off to?
PETER GUILLAM	Lunch.
ROY BLAND	Want some company?
ROY BLAND	Tell you the truth, I'm in no hurry to get back up there...
PETER GUILLAM	Smothered by the Mothers.
ROY BLAND	Something like that. Those old birds, all pining for Control. Percy still can't get a decent cup of tea out of them. Still, I imagine it takes time.
PETER GUILLAM	What does?
ROY BLAND	Loyalty.
ROY BLAND (CONT'D)	If it was up to me, I'd replace them all with those `naice' girls from registry. Like to hear a few high heels about the place.
ROY BLAND (CONT'D)	Scrounge a fag?
PETER GUILLAM	Here.
ROY BLAND	What do you think of Datsuns?
PETER GUILLAM	What?
ROY BLAND	Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made me. Hatchback. Caught sight of myself in it, driving past a shop window and I thought to myself "Who's that old fucker?" What are you driving?
PETER GUILLAM	Citroen.
ROY BLAND	French? Ooh la la...
ROY BLAND (CONT'D)	Drink up and I'll drop you back. You've probably got some girl waiting...
PETER GUILLAM	Jerry Westerby, dismissed December 4th. And... Connie Sachs, retired November 28th. That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.
SMILEY	I know that car.
LACON	On our way to La Bohème. The Minister wondered if there was anything to report?
SMILEY	Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs. I wonder how Research manages without her.
PETER GUILLAM	Probably relieved. She always struck me as unhinged.
SMILEY	That was one of her talents.
LACON	Looking a little unhinged yourself, George.
SMILEY	Hmm?
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Yes, I suppose I am. Perhaps that's what we have to become? A little paranoid?
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Your "clean sweep." What if the Mole was actually behind that sweep? What if each of us, whether we knew it or not, represented a threat to the Mole?
LACON	Control lost his position because of that fiasco in Budapest... that poor chap...? He looks to Guillam for the name.
PETER GUILLAM	Jim Prideaux.
SMILEY	Yes. Yes, he did.
LACON	How did you get this? This is Witchcraft material.
SMILEY	Control was out. And Alleline was in. Thanks to...
SMILEY (V.O.)	... Alleline's "special source."
LACON (V.O.)	There is no connection.
SMILEY (V.O.)	Everything is connected. Near the back of the class we find BILL ROACH. He's plump,
SMILEY	Return to Oxford please.
SMILEY	Oh, I brought...
CONNIE SACHS	Not supposed to. Doctor's orders. Wicked, wicked George.
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	I miss it all so much. All my lovely boys.
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	I don't know about you, George but I feel seriously under- fucked.
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	She doesn't deserve you, George. Not one hair on your head, never did...
SMILEY	You left the Circus shortly after I retired...
CONNIE SACHS	I didn't leave. I was dismissed. Chucked out on the rubbish heap. (Beat) Like you.
SMILEY	Why?
CONNIE SACHS	"Lost my sense of proportion." That's what that personnel cow said. Wouldn't let go of a bone.
SMILEY	Which bone?
CONNIE SACHS	Polyakov. Smiley nods, a look of boredom settling on his face - A
SMILEY	Polyakov.
CONNIE SACHS	Cultural Attaché Polyakov.
SMILEY	Stationed where?
CONNIE SACHS	Here. London. Turned up in sixty five. And I had a feeling, as soon as I laid eyes on him. But that little swine Toby Esterhase told me I was seeing Spies under the bed.
SMILEY	Esterhase said that?
CONNIE SACHS	He had him graded Persil. Whiter than white. And that was that.
SMILEY	But you disagreed?
CONNIE SACHS	Pretty Polly? Very military bearing for someone who's never supposed to have been in the army. But, he was good. Went to Embassy functions, lectures. I love a man who lives his cover. Never put a foot wrong.
SMILEY	Never?
CONNIE SACHS	Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly... ... the busiest culture vulture that Embassy ever had.
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	For years we'd been hearing rumours that Karla was building a private army of his own, outside Moscow Centre. We knew he had agents scattered round the globe. I started spending time with the Moscow gazers combing Soviet bulletins and any material I could get.
CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Late one night in Research, I was trawling through some footage of May Day in Berlin, 1969. I saw something, George.
CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I saw it, George.
CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Why would a distinguished soldier, four medals for gallantry, salute our cultural attache Polly? Unless Polly was a war veteran himself? And if he was, why hide the fact? What did you do?
CONNIE SACHS (V.O.)	I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline. I said - "Polyakov is a Karla-trained Hood if ever I saw one. And if he's here it's because he's running a mole." What did they say?
PERCY ALLELINE	You're to leave Polyakov alone. You're becoming obsessed with him.
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)	You're losing your sense of proportion, Connie. Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.
CONNIE SACHS	does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway, apart from Bill Haydon. Better off out of it. (Beat)I know you never liked him.
SMILEY	What nonsense. What on earth makes you say that?
CONNIE SACHS	I don't know. She turns to the shoe box beside her, takes out a
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	Here we are. The Nursery in our day.
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	There's Control himself, you behind him, as usual...
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	Jim Prideaux... and Bill Haydon. Together of course. The Inseparables. All my boys. That was a good time, George.
SMILEY	It was the war, Connie.
CONNIE SACHS	A real war. Englishmen could be proud then.
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	I was right, then? About Polyakov. There's a mole?
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)	If it's bad, don't come back. I want to remember you all as you were.
POLYAKOV (O.S.)	... The Priest is surprised to see General Secretary Krushchev...
POLYAKOV	... He says "Father, father, I've just had sex with two 17 year old girls." The Priest says "That's quite a sin, but you're an Atheist, General Secretary..."
POLYAKOV (CONT'D)	"... why are you telling me?" ... Krushchev says "I'm seventy- seven, I'm telling everyone." He begins to register the faint noises around him...
CONTROL	Step into my lair.
CONTROL	Sit down and take a look at this nonsense.
CONTROL (CONT'D)	Report by Soviet High Command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea. Just what the Admiralty have been begging us for some information on.
SMILEY	Where did you get it?
CONTROL	I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.
TOBY ESTERHASE	Control...
CONTROL	Shut up, Esterhase.
SMILEY	If it's genuine it's gold-dust. it suspect. turns to Alleline, with a mocking smile.
CONTROL	Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake.
SMILEY	Where does it come from? What's the access?
CONTROL	Percy doesn't feel like telling.
PERCY ALLELINE	A new secret source of mine.
SMILEY	But how could he possibly have access to...?
PERCY ALLELINE	He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making.
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)	We have named the operation "Witchcraft."
SMILEY	We?
CONTROL	Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret.
PERCY ALLELINE	The Minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here. Too much failure, too many scandals, too little solid intelligence!
CONTROL	Luckily Percy's cabal has come to save us.
PERCY ALLELINE	It's all office politics here.
ROY BLAND	Percy does have a point, Control. We should be fighting communism, not each other.
PERCY ALLELINE	Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners...
CONTROL	Your bloody Yanks!
PERCY ALLELINE	And we've had enough! There's going to be changes, Smiley! Changes.
TOBY ESTERHASE	We need to decide if we're part of the past, or part of the future.
CONTROL	I should have left you where I found you.
ROY BLAND	Control, if we could all just...
CONTROL	OUT! ALL OF YOU!
SMILEY	If Witchcraft is genuine...
CONTROL	I don't trust miracles. We hear a KNOCKING and find ourselves back in...
MENDEL	Courtesy of Mrs P. You been up all night?
SMILEY	Yes.
MENDEL	What's that?
SMILEY	Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund.
MENDEL	What for?
SMILEY	For a Mister Ellis.
MENDEL	Who's Ellis?
SMILEY	It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.
MENDEL	What's so strange about that then?
SMILEY	The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was someone giving him a thousand pounds two months later?
PRIDEAUX	Hand those out.
PRIDEAUX	Come down here.
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)	Boy with the marble.
ROACH	Yes sir.
PRIDEAUX	Gave me a turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a Juju man. What's your name?
BILL ROACH	Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new boy.
PRIDEAUX	New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story?
BILL ROACH	My mother and father... my father's left, so...
PRIDEAUX	Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that?
BILL ROACH	No sir.
PRIDEAUX	Known a lot of Bills. They've all been good `uns. What you good at?
BILL ROACH	Nothing sir.
PRIDEAUX	You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right?
BILL ROACH	Yes sir.
PRIDEAUX	Free period, isn't it? Don't waste it down here.
RICKI TARR	Hello Mister Smiley. You remember me.
SMILEY	Hello, Ricki. You missed a wedge.
RICKI TARR	Losing my touch. I know what I must look like. Rip Van Winkle. Feel like him. I could sleep for a year. Two years.
SMILEY	Where've you been, Ricki?
RICKI TARR	Here, there. Run out of places now. They're gonna kill me.
SMILEY	Who is?
RICKI TARR	Your lot. Or their lot. Whoever gets me first. I'm innocent, by the way. Within reason. (Beat) You going to find him then? The Mole?
SMILEY	I'm going to try. How long have you been here?
RICKI TARR	Few days. Needed somewhere to hide.
RICKI TARR (CONT'D)	Old habits.
SMILEY	I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it.
RICKI TARR	Calculated risk Mister Smiley. I wanted to see you, figured you'd turn up here sooner or later.
SMILEY	What do you want Ricki?
RICKI TARR	There's a woman. I want you to trade for her. Get her back from Karla.
SMILEY	What woman?
RICKI TARR	Her name's Irina.
RICKI TARR (O.S.)	I met her in Istanbul. They'd found some Russian trade delegate, name of Boris. He was spending high and wide in the nightclubs and some idiot thought we could turn him.
RICKI TARR (V.O.)	I took one look and saw that he was a hood, Moscow trained.
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Probably coat trailing, trying to draw one of our men out into the open.
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	He had a wife with him. Common- law.
TUFTY THESINGER	This is going to be a long night.
RICKI TARR	You baby-sit this one.
RICKI TARR	Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. (Beat) Just wanted to check you were alright.
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	There was something about her.
SMILEY	You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London?
RICKI TARR	Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her.
SMILEY	Sense what?
RICKI TARR	A secret.
RICKI TARR (V.O.)	I played the businessman, Michael Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought I'd take my time with it...
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)	But second date she made this open play...
IRINA	I know what you are.
IRINA (CONT'D)	I would like to talk to your boss Control. I have something to trade. Something big. I want a new life in the West.
IRINA (CONT'D)	That is the deal. You tell them.
SMILEY	What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing?
RICKI TARR	We've all got our strengths. And weaknesses. Me, I know women. She said she had a secret. The mother of all secrets. Said she'd only tell Control. She wanted to trade. New life for her and her kids.
SMILEY	She had children in Russia?
RICKI TARR	That's why they let her and Boris out. So, I said I'd tell the Circus.
SMILEY	But you didn't?
RICKI TARR (V.O.)	Wanted to find out more first. So, I waited her out.
RICKI TARR (CONT'D)	You can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.(Beat. Carefully) If they had more information...
RICKI TARR (CONT'D)	Well, if you won't tell me more, there's nothing I can do.
IRINA	If I tell you, I'm putting my life in your hands. The lives of my children? Do you understand?
IRINA	Promise me you'll be careful. No details to the Circus. Not until we're safe.
RICKI TARR	I promise.
TUFTY THESINGER	You were supposed to have gone. London stations's been on to me. They want to know what the hell you're doing.
RICKI TARR	Fuck off.
SMILEY	And what did your message say, Ricki?
RICKI TARR	Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect.
SMILEY	What else? I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something.
RICKI TARR	I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in myself.
SMILEY	Yes. I quite see that.
RICKI TARR	I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus. And what else?
RICKI TARR	That she had information concerning a Double Agent. I was just trying to... to get the proper attention. (Beat) And I told them to tell Mister Guillam that this was the reason I hadn't come home, not because I'd defected or anything.
SMILEY	What happened next Ricki?
RICKI TARR	I waited for a reply.
RICKI TARR (V.O.)	I waited hours but that was all they sent. It didn't make sense. Like they were stalling.
RICKI TARR	They put her on a ship. That's all I know. I've done a lot of things Mister Smiley, but... I don't know why... I keep thinking about her. (Beat)
RICKI TARR (CONT'D)	She wasn't even my type. (Beat) I want to get her out. I owe her that.
SMILEY	Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe.
RICKI TARR	Who's going to keep you safe? Alleline walks along the courts, new racquet in hand,
OLIVER LACON	Percy has always resisted suggestions of wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.
MINISTER	Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.
PERCY ALLELINE	I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies, so far, Minister.
MINISTER	Greedy boy.
PERCY ALLELINE	My goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt. I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in- arms.
MINISTER	You think they'll take us back into bed?
PERCY ALLELINE	I'm not interested in a one-off trade. I want on-going access to American intelligence.
MINISTER	Do you think we can get it?
PERCY ALLELINE	With Witchcraft on our side, I think we can get anything we bloody-well want.
CONTROL (O.S.)	Percy?
CONTROL	Percy. Did you do this?
CONTROL (CONT'D)	You penny pinching Scot. Can you not take a bloody order. No one is to tamper with the recipe. It's going to take us five hours to get drunk on this piss water.
PERCY ALLELINE	I followed the recipe.
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)	For God's sake Mary...
CONTROL	Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a lady of taste? Ann will sort it out.
SMILEY	I'll go find her.
PETER GUILLAM	You look tired.
SMILEY	Yes. I didn't sleep well. (Beat) I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. reservation...
PETER GUILLAM	Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation?
SMILEY	If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone.
MENDEL	You're clean. Nothing on your back. Nothing on your conscience.
BRYANT	Mister Guillam? How's the family?
PETER GUILLAM	Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry today.
BRYANT	Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag sir.
PETER GUILLAM	Time you oiled this thing, isn't it? We keep asking...
PETER GUILLAM	You're kidding?
JANITOR PETE	New rules.
PETER GUILLAM	Mind the jewels.
JANITOR PETE	Pen and watch sir. What the hell are you doing up here?
PETER GUILLAM	You don't look pleased to see me, Bill?
BILL HAYDON	Why would I be? You bloody pariah.
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)	We like the Scalp-hunters to know their place. On the second floor.
PETER GUILLAM	Doing some research. Makes a change from sitting on my arse.
BILL HAYDON	Heard it was quiet down there.
PETER GUILLAM	As the grave. When're you going to give us something to do?
BILL HAYDON	Haven't you heard? Technology's the future. No need for you apes anymore. I can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing.
PETER GUILLAM	Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting on my arse.
JANITOR ALWYN	Want me to look after that for you, Mister Guillam?
PETER GUILLAM	Thanks...
JANITOR ALWYN	Gotta give you a chit. The Dolphin'll kill me if I don't. New Rules.
PETER GUILLAM	So, chit me.
SAL	What you up to this weekend?
PETER GUILLAM	Visiting aunts.
SAL	I'll bet. Corridor D.
SAL (CONT'D)	The two-eights are halfway on your right, the three-ones are next alcove down. We find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the
JANITOR ALWYN	Telephone sir.
PETER GUILLAM	Oh to hell, who is it?
JANITOR ALWYN	Outside line, sir. Someone rough. The garage, I think, regarding your car.
PETER GUILLAM	Hello? (Beat) Well, damn. Can't you do the bloody repair?
MENDEL	Can't be done sir, you're going to need a new gear box.
PETER GUILLAM	At least get on to the main dealers first...
PETER GUILLAM (O.S.)	Have you got the number?
PETER GUILLAM	Well, hold on...
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)	... Alwyn? Chuck me the bag a minute, will you?
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)	Thanks.
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)	946-0335. OK? Thanks. TOBY ESTERHASE is standing in front of him. Unfriendly
TOBY ESTERHASE	Could we see you Peter?
TOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D)	Percy would like quite an urgent word with you. Can you come now to the fifth floor? That would be so kind.
PETER GUILLAM	Of course.
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)	You might just throw that into the lift for me, mark it for the second floor, save me filling out more bloody chits?
JANITOR ALWYN	Will do sir.
PERCY ALLELINE (O.S.)	Esterhase, I'll have no phone calls, tell them...
TOBY ESTERHASE	The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies...
MOTHER	We can hear.
TOBY ESTERHASE	We are having a conference.
PERCY ALLELINE	Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally?
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)	What are you getting up to down there these days, apart from chasing our virgins...
PETER GUILLAM	Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Other than that, getting quite good at ping-pong.
PERCY ALLELINE	Arabs... You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right Bill?
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)	How's Ricki Tarr these days?
PETER GUILLAM	Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.
PERCY ALLELINE	I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.
PETER GUILLAM	I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.
PERCY ALLELINE	What's that shrug for? I'm talking to you about a murderer. I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section! I'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back! Don't damn well shrug at me! How'd you like a term in prison?
PETER GUILLAM	But I haven't been seeing him! So get your facts straight and get OFF MY BACK!
PERCY ALLELINE	So if I told you that Tarr had recently arrived in Paris would you be surprised?
PETER GUILLAM	Nothing would surprise me about Tarr.
PERCY ALLELINE	And if I told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you?
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)	Your man's a defector, Guillam. Got turned by the opposition months ago and now they've sent him back to us!
PETER GUILLAM	What for?
PERCY ALLELINE	Never mind what for! To muddy the water, that's what for! Spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails! The point is this - he's heading for home. The first peep from him you come to the grown-ups, understood? Anyone you see at this table. But not another damn soul!
MECHANIC	He's waiting for you.
MENDEL	All go smoothly did it? (Beat) Where we off to?
PETER GUILLAM	The hotel. I have to see George.
MENDEL	Mister Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue.
PETER GUILLAM (O.S.)	George? hurries into the room, stops, seeing Tarr. Tarr
TARR	Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I took so long to come back.
FAWN	Excuse me, sir.
SMILEY	Ricki's been helping us Peter. telling us all about his adventures.
PETER GUILLAM	He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds!
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)	I stole that, because of you! I spied on my own. Do you know how that makes me feel?
SMILEY	As you did take the trouble to steal it...
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information?
RICKI TARR	S'right.
SMILEY	What was the date?
PETER GUILLAM	He doesn't know because there was no telegram! The whole thing...
RICKI TARR	November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening.
SMILEY	Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence?
PETER GUILLAM	What about the money?
SMILEY	Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him.
PETER GUILLAM	"Enquiries to the fifth floor."
SMILEY	You recognize that handwriting? (Beat) That's Toby Esterhase.
PETER GUILLAM	Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr?
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)	In case I didn't make it out of the Circus...
SMILEY	Secrecy is a habit.
PETER GUILLAM	I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done.
PETER GUILLAM	I'm sorry.
SMILEY	What for?
PETER GUILLAM	I wanted to believe Tarr was lying. (Beat) All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it.
SMILEY	I met him once. Karla.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there...
SMILEY (CONT'D)	The Americans have had him tortured.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	No fingernails. It's incredibly hot. I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home. Things weren't going well with Ann.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	I give him the usual pitch... Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life. After questioning. Or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like Bykov, Shur, Muranov...
PETER GUILLAM	What did he say?
SMILEY	Think of your wife. You have a wife, don't you? I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Use my lighter.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	"We could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade. If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her. Think about how much she..."
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Kept harping on about the damn wife! Telling him more about me, than... Should have walked out, of course, but for some reason... it seemed important to save this one. (Beat) So I go on. "Know you're a chain-smoker, help yourself," "We're not so very different you and I.."
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Look, we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems. Don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine? Silence. Smiley sits back, dropping the game.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Never said a word. Not one word. Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. He kept my lighter. It was a gift - "To George, from Ann. All my love."
PETER GUILLAM	That was Karla? And he flew back to die rather than give in?
SMILEY	Yes. (Beat) And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.
PETER GUILLAM	What did he look like?
SMILEY	That's the thing. (Beat) I can't remember.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	After today, Peter you have to assume they're watching you. If there's anything you need tidied up... now's the time.
RICHARD	Nearly done. For Godsakes... I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain.
RICHARD (CONT'D)	If there's someone else, you can tell me. I'm a grown-up.
ROACH	Time sir?
PRIDEAUX	Got your specs on Jumbo?
ROACH	Yes, sir.
PRIDEAUX	Who's the fellow down there?
ROACH	Don't know sir.
PRIDEAUX	Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way?
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)	Wouldn't you look if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car around a field? Doesn't he like boys? Anyone sees him again, let me know. Don't hold with odd bods hanging about. Might steal the Alvis, which is...?
CLASS	Best car in England!
BELINDA	Stop it! Stop it!
KASPAR	Keep your bloody hands off her!
SCALPHUNTER	Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt! Haven't seen many of the boys and girls for a while, matter of fact.
JERRY WESTERBY	But that's the way it is, George, isn't it? When you're out, you're out. Too much of this stuff.
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)	Too much wampum not good for braves. How.
SMILEY	How. (Beat) I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you?
JERRY WESTERBY	Yes. Control asked me to man the phones that night. Said someone was doing a special job for the service. He wanted someone from outside he could trust. If anything came in, I was to tell him and only him.
JERRY WESTERBY	Been a bit of a panic, sir. From the FO resident clerk... A Hungarian news bulletin, sir. (Reading) British spy, work-name Ellis, travelling with false Hungarian papers, has attempted to kidnap an unnamed Hungarian general in Budapest. He's been shot, other arrests imminent...
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)	Can I have a brief, please? Sir? Do you want me to deny it?
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)	I have to have a brief sir?
JERRY WESTERBY	Ann? I'm sorry to bother you. Is George back yet?
SMILEY	You rang my house?
JERRY WESTERBY	Just on the off chance you were back from Berlin.
SMILEY	What did you say?
JERRY WESTERBY	Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis. She said you weren't back yet. That was it.
SMILEY	Go on.
JERRY WESTERBY	All hell broke loose - military yelling about Hungarian tank movements on the border, Lacon and the Minister baying at the door. Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did.
BILL HAYDON	Get out.
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)	Tell me.
JERRY WESTERBY	I tried to get hold of you...
BILL HAYDON	I just picked up half a story on the ticker-tape at my club... Tell me.
JERRY WESTERBY	Jim Prideaux's been shot. Haydon goes white.
HAYDON	Get me the Hungarian Embassy.
JERRY WESTERBY	Yes sir...
BILL HAYDON	You go and tell your Masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged...
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)	Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell him to pull in the Hungarian agents, anyone we're onto. Tell him to get down to the London School of Economics, sandbag some bloody students and put them on ice at Sarratt.
JERRY WESTERBY	Any more news on him?
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)	Bill? (Beat) Oh God, is he...?
BILL HAYDON	We need to go to his flat. Clear out anything linked. Haydon stands with his back to us, possibly crying. Westerby
PETER GUILLAM	Haydon heard the news at his club?
SMILEY	The Saville.
PETER GUILLAM	At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running.
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)	So how did he know? Oh Jesus, George...
SMILEY	Peter...
PETER GUILLAM	Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known?
SMILEY	It's not him, Peter.
PETER GUILLAM	Then how did he know?
SMILEY	Because he was at my house that night. With Ann. I quite like this.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Hello? Oh hello Jerry. No I'm afraid George isn't back yet.
OLD MAN	Just in case it's of interest, dear. We are observed. Old Filth in the bushes. Not very subtle but there you are... He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the Good flight? Yes. Pleasant enough.
BILL HAYDON	I was just passing, thought I'd call in. Ann was in bed but she insisted on getting up. She said she'll be down in a minute.
Smiley glances at a half-wrapped oil painting lying against	
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)	That's what I'm dropping off.
BILL HAYDON (O.S.)	Awful daub really but Ann expressed a liking... What's keeping her?
ROACH (O.S.)	Sir?
JIM PRIDEAUX	Come in, Roach. Thought you were in sick bay? What are you... What is it, Jumbo?
ROACH	Sir there's a stranger parked down on the road. He's just sitting there.
PRIDEAUX	It's alright, old fella. Don't cry. Nobody ever watched like you, did they? Off you go, now.
ROACH	Are you going to have to leave?
JIM PRIDEAUX	I'll be fine. You get back to bed.
CONTROL	You weren't followed?
CONTROL (CONT'D)	Trust no-one, Jim. Especially not in the main stream. What Hungarian identities do you still have running?
PRIDEAUX	Andras Benedek, Hungarian journalist based in Paris.
CONTROL	If you're caught, you keep me out of it. You were acting alone, bit of Private Enterprise. Understood?
CONTROL (CONT'D)	I've had an offer of service. A Hungarian General. Wants to come over. I want you to meet him. He has information I need, Jim.
PRIDEAUX	What information?
CONTROL	Rocketry. Ballistics. Bit of politics.
PRIDEAUX	What else?
CONTROL	Treasure. He has treasure. The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus.
CONTROL (CONT'D)	There's a rotten apple Jim and we have to find it. I'm so close I can almost feel his heart beating. I know it's one of five men. All I want from you is one word.
CONTROL (CONT'D)	Alleline - Tinker. (Points at the next photo) Haydon - Tailor. Bland - Soldier. We drop Sailor, it's too close to Tailor. Esterhase - Poorman.
SMILEY	Which means I was...?
PRIDEAUX	You were Beggarman.
SMILEY	What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory?
PRIDEAUX	I thought it was madness. To think any one of you could have been a traitor... madness.
SMILEY	But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why?
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be?
PRIDEAUX	I went because Control asked me to go. It's called doing one's duty. What did you tell them?
PRIDEAUX (V.O.)	Everything.
PRIDEAUX	I held on as long as I could, to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there. (Beat) Did they?
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)	My networks in Hungary. Did they get out?
SMILEY	No. They were blown. The story is you blew them to save your own skin. nods, makes an odd gesture as if he's about to
SMILEY (CONT'D)	What was your last line of defence?
PRIDEAUX	The Mole. Control's crazy theory. I was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me. Which was a joke.
SMILEY	Why?
PRIDEAUX	Because they already knew. They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation.
SMILEY	What else?
PRIDEAUX	Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife still drinking, who was Bland screwing in the office. That sort of thing.
SMILEY	Did they ask about me at all?
PRIDEAUX	One of them did.
SMILEY	What did he say about me?
PRIDEAUX	He had a cigarette lighter. Kept flashing it round for me to see. Showed me the inscription. "To George, from Ann. All my love." He reckoned after Bill's fling with her, she might want to change the inscription.
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)	I told him to go to hell.
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)	If they had one man like Bill Haydon they could call it set and match!
SMILEY	That was well said.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Try and put it all behind you, Jim.
PRIDEAUX	He gave me a cigarette.
SMILEY	Jim?
PRIDEAUX	I thought it was my last one.
MAN'S VOICE	Do you know this woman?
PRIDEAUX	I don't know her.
IRINA	I... Tell Percy Alleline what we did. Do you know who she was?
SMILEY (V.O.)	Nobody you need concern yourself with. An unfortunate...
SMILEY (CONT'D)	He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor.
PETER GUILLAM	Who?
SMILEY	Toby Esterhase.
SMILEY	He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about "Tinker, Tailor?"
PETER GUILLAM	You alright?
SMILEY	Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had.
PETER GUILLAM	Yes, George. I'll watch. What exactly did Irina say?
RICKI TARR	She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla.
MINISTER	This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?
SMILEY	Perfectly, Minister. (Beat) There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house.
MINISTER	I don't know what you're talking about.
MINISTER (CONT'D (CONT'D)	I don't know the address. And I fail to see the... I thought Lacon had made it clear to you, keep your nose bloody-well out of Witchcraft's business!
SMILEY	It's Lacon's advice I'm following. (To Lacon) You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.
MINISTER	Well, I wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with. It's taken Alleline - and, if I may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race.
SMILEY	I'm glad you take some of the credit.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla.
MINISTER	That's... that's not possible.
SMILEY	Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that.
MINISTER	Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! It's been gold!
SMILEY	Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.
MINISTER	Oh God... We can't be made to look like fucking fools again! Forget Europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News! What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm? Is the Kremlin likely to boast about this?
LACON	Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a threat...
MINISTER	Well, tell them to play the game. We don't go crowing about their fuck-ups!
SMILEY	We are not the prize. We're the bait. You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that?
MINISTER	What can we do?
SMILEY	We have one thing the Mole wants.
OMITTED 200	
RICKI TARR	If I go...
PETER GUILLAM	You'll go...
RICKI TARR	... I want your word you'll get Irina back. Don't care who you have to trade. I want a family. Don't wanna end up like you lot...
RICKI TARR (CONT'D)	We're gonna live in Paris out of your hair. You'll get her back?
SMILEY	I'll do my utmost, Ricki.
SMILEY (O.S.)	Keep walking please.
SMILEY (CONT'D)	I want to talk about loyalty Toby. Control recruited you when you were trying to escape from Hungary didn't he? A wanted man. Saved you from a KGB bullet, didn't he? And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience. You've survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides, serve any Master?
TOBY ESTERHASE	What... what's this about George?
SMILEY	It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby.
SMILEY	Intelligence has been leaked, Toby. Someone's been taking files from the Circus...
TOBY ESTERHASE	This is a mistake George, this is all...
SMILEY	The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?
TOBY ESTERHASE	Yes. And yes, I delivered them.
TOBY ESTERHASE (V.O.)	... but so did Percy...
TOBY ESTERHASE	... and Bill...
TOBY ESTERHASE	And Roy...
TOBY ESTERHASE	Things aren't always what they seem. You know that George. Moscow thinks Polyakov's working for them, so, every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them, just chicken-feed, keep his bosses happy. But Polyakov's our Joe, part of a big operation...
SMILEY	Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I know.
TOBY ESTERHASE	Why are we here? Why are we...? I don't... I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this George!
SMILEY	Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor?
TOBY ESTERHASE	Bland!
SMILEY	To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby?
TOBY ESTERHASE	Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who.
SMILEY	You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft? I know all about your secret source. And I know something you don't. I know who he is.(Beat) He's Karla.
SMILEY (V.O.)	One of you has been giving Polyakov the Crown Jewels.
TOBY ESTERHASE	I didn't know. I swear I...
SMILEY	Are you still a wanted man, Toby?
TOBY ESTERHASE	George...!
SMILEY	You picked the wrong side, Toby.
TOBY ESTERHASE	George, you've got to believe me. I would never... I'm loyal, George. I'm loyal!
SMILEY	Give me the address. Where do you meet Polyakov?
SMILEY	What are the safety signals?
MRS MCCRAIG	There's an air duct. Open and all's well. Closed and you're not to enter.
SMILEY	Where is the mike, Mrs McCraig?
SMILEY (CONT'D)	And what's the procedure?
MRS MCCRAIG	Whenever the gentlemen are meeting I record the session. The tapes are sent back to the Circus. What are they doing? They shouldn't be moving things!
SMILEY	If you're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone. Let's try the tape recorder shall we?
PETER GUILLAM (O.S.)	The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled. The flame that lit the battles wreck, shone round him o'er the dead...
PETER GUILLAM'S VOICE	... Yet beautiful and bright he stood...
MACKLEVORE	Guest from London Station, Monsieur Fourcade.
MACKELVORE	The whole service is looking for you, Ricki. They'll skin you alive if they find you.
RICKI TARR	Maybe I want them to find me.
MACKELVORE	You can go home now, Ben. Leave the books where they are and put the keys into the machines. I'll be talking to London presently under my own steam.
BEN	Okay boss.
RICKI TARR	Ben stays here.
RICKI TARR	Ricki Tarr claims to have further information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus. MENDEL'S P.O.V. - THE CIRCUS ACROSS THE ROAD.
MENDEL	Tinker...
SMILEY	How's he look?
MENDEL (O.S.)	Busy. Tailor...
MENDEL (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Here comes Soldier...
MENDEL (O.S.)	Full house.
RICKI TARR	Read it aloud.
BEN	Personal for Tarr from Alleline... ... require clarification before meeting your request...
BEN (O.S.)	... Quote information vital to safeguarding of the Circus unquote does not qualify...
BEN	... send further information.
RICKI TARR	That's the way Percy boy! You keep stalling. I better warn you Ben, there's some lousy people in this outfit. Don't trust a fucking one of them. SMILEY'S P.O.V. Mister Smiley...
SMILEY	I'm here, Mendel.
MENDEL (O.S.)	One's gone. What is your cover story in case we are disturbed?
POLYAKOV (O.S.)	This can be salvaged. Tarr can be found and liquidated.
PETER GUILLAM	He's here.
OLIVER LACON	I won't have bloodshed. I want absolute calm! GUILLAM'S P.O.V.
SMILEY	I was assured there would be no coercion.
BILL HAYDON	It's almost funny George. I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks. I taught most of them. Don't mind the tears. Just a reaction. An over-reaction, if you like. Craddox says I'll be off in a few days. I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow. I rather hoped you would do a little light house-keeping for me.
SMILEY	If I can.
BILL HAYDON	There's a girl...Would you give her some money for me? Give her a good cover story. If it helps tell her I love her. It's all here.
SMILEY	Of course.
BILL HAYDON	There's a boy too. Bung him a few quid to shut him up. Take it out of the reptile fund.
SMILEY	I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux.
BILL HAYDON	Damn it! I got him back, didn't I?
SMILEY	Yes, yes you did. That was good of you. (Beat) I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you?
SMILEY (CONT'D)	Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission?
BILL HAYDON	Yes, as a matter of fact he did.
SMILEY	To say what?
SMILEY (CONT'D)	To warn you. Because he knew, deep down, it was you all along.
BILL HAYDON	So did you.
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)	I had to pick a side George. It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. The West has grown so very ugly, don't you think?
SMILEY	Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?
BILL HAYDON	I'm not his bloody office boy.
SMILEY	What are you then?
BILL HAYDON	I'm someone who made his mark.
SMILEY	Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann?
BILL HAYDON	Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that? Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. But you do have a blind spot.
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)	He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover you wouldn't be able to see me straight. And he was right, up to a point.
SMILEY	Up to a point.
SMILEY	"Tailor." HAYDON'S P.O.V.
BILL HAYDON	Just like us Jim. (Beat) Best days. A rifle is placed on the side of his head - the same
ROACH	I made you something.
PRIDEAUX	I don't want you hanging around here. Keep away from me from now on. Go and join the others.
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)	Just bloody join in. Go and play damn you. Tarr spins round, but the woman has disappeared. He stares
SMILEY	Shall we begin?
