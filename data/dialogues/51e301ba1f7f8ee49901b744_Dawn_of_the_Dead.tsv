CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
DEAD	George A. Romero We see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly and her expression grows more desperate. can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national emergency.
The woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the	background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The woman sits up, snapping awake. Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days. several hours, covered by an old overcoat.
The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to	where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time. We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran looks about. She is still shaken from her dream. Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing emotionally. DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN. WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW! organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip over cables and generally get in each other's way. floor.

The stage hands and cameramen are all screaming at him, swearing and ridiculing. We notice Police guards, armed, at the studio doors. They control the traffic in and out of the big room. still reigns. CHARLIE'S RECEIVING ON THE EMERGENCIES...

LET HER THROUGH.
The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a small	camera room. The foot traffic is solid. They talk as they walk. OF DOORS...YOU AVOID A LOT OF HASSLES IF YOU GOT A BADGE...ANY KIND OF BADGE... machine which rolls out a list of rescue stations. The list is superimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out.
On the monitors, we see the rescue stations blink off over shots	of the two men who still argue on the air. THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN RE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT LARGE! Doctor Foster tries to out-scream the cries... FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS...WHAT DOES IT TAKE... WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?
Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters	argue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment. THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT. IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS... WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE- OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE BODY. TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...
Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and	finally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes. YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR. WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES. off toward a large teleprompter typing machine. DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM. BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS! THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL!
Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter	typist, Fran rushes back toward the control room.
Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even	more frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the station managers. OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN? MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT. WE'RE ON THE AIR. of the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the control panel and starts to walk away.

Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up	personal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The door is guarded by a nervous Officer.

Foster tries to talk over the noise... THE CITY... their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster continues to speak. the sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not believing what she is seeing. TO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION...
Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up	quickly behind Fran. WE'RE GETTING OUT. STEPHEN...I DON'T BELIEVE THIS...WHAT... Stephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence. COULD BE UP THERE AT NINE. DON'T MAKE ME COME LOOKIN' FOR YA. cameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman. The cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder, speaks to Francine quietly and slowly. ANYWAY. EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER. OUR RESPONSIBILITY... IS FINISHED, I'M AFRAID. We see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income housing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky. Unit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building. Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons, take position here and there about the development.
Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court	below.
On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire	stairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team members. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch. The sweep hand reaches the 12...
In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the	building. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn. HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED...
The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete	caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a few windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of the bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time. LITTLE BASTARD'S GOT 'EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE BUILDING...DUMB LITTLE BASTARD!
Commander: (on the bullhorn again)	MARTINEZ...THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR AND NEITHER DO YOU! slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky. bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly.

The boy doesn't know now to react. He is obviously nervous. GO IN. IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT MAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T GONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW 'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES! YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT? MY TIME! open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading expression on his face.
Figures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other	S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with his automatic weapon. the bullhorn: GODDAMMIT!
Sergeant: (into walkie talkie)	ALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION!
On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young	man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out. rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed down. Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof top. of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him. COME AND GET 'EM... down. cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a break... across the roof. the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where they are held at gun point. against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on every floor of the complex structure.
Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are	filled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are choked as they attempt to shoot their way out.
The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the	building. HOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM DOWN THE STAIRS.
Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their	bizarre looking gas masks. kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group is led into the hallway. apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed. He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly into the room.
The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the	hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people kneel or fall against the walls praying. him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger, but Roger manages to hold on. very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a deep voice. but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling off his gun at the open apartment door. hallway. The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one shot through Wooley's head. The big man falls back violently. Other S.W.A.T. Officers face him threateningly. He stares at them through his mask. They let him pass. He disappears through the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the civilians. to his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment which Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes widen as well. remains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds.
Roger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves	inside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm badly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers. in the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming down the corridor. More confusion, as civilians push through the Troopers who try to hold them back. which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor.
The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third	Officer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer, flailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman. There are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of the walking dead. room. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the Trooper. male, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles with his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels something on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and lamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its hold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot free his pistol.
Roger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the	woman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back immediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires. A slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her onslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes. at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking violently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He fires again...and again...and again. Troopers try to keep things calm. the Trooper can stop her, the woman throws her arms around the creature.
S.W.A.T. 3: GRAB HER...GET HER OUT OF THERE...	arm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the creature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from behind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper grabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm. and the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and, with all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances again. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He fires. The bullet drops her. male ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming woman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the floor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's shoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through the skull. It falls. Troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the clouds of gas in a totally dazed state.
Roger and the third Trooper from the apartment drift to the	hallway. The third Trooper moves into the crowd, but Roger stands against the open door jamb for a moment. looks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself through the head. metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair railing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself. He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which still clings in the air. nearby. Roger looks up. Sitting on the stairs above is the Trooper who shot Wooley. His rifle is aimed at Roger. I DIDN'T SEE HOW HE DIED.
Roger slings his rifle, so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his	gun. He removes his gas mask. He is Black. I JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF... I COULD RUN. TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME. stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows. stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready their weapons. of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath.
The men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward	slightly, trying not to make a sound. the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly... robed...in black...is sees the Troopers... PLEASE TO LET ME PASS... and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish.
Roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his	breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at his chest. ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER... BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE... THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN. THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE... BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE! wants to help in some way. WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING YOU FIND THEM... NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL... the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the gas mist, coughing. THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU...
The old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears	in the cloud... STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR... the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage area.
The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons	raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers... silent, not knowing what to expect. remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies pushes into the hall. Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They are all ages, from the very old to the very young. and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring other troopers. front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush.
The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass	of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by clutching ghouls. They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless onslaught.
As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage	area, several Troopers move into the room. around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.
And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of	corpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still moving, their heads uninjured.
Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire	and screaming can be heard from the hall. He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears roll down his cheeks. eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move. arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls closer, its mouth wide. creatures head with his automatic rifle. the pistol. where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never look up. They don't seem to notice him at all. Several other Troopers look down into the storage area. just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round lenses of their masks. big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head.
Nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also	writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man fires into the thing's head. DON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY THEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY DO IT? RESPECT IN DYING. by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it is turning into a riot. lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware. occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one another. They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken chain in the wind. sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed guard.
Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large	square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters. Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper and launches.
The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another	officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter. for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the gently bobbing heliport. cockpit.
Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of	the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for the fuel pumps. eyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which lie near the fuel pumps. IT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT. civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with Fran following.
At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead,	Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism. SPITS OUT AT YA.
The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard	shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie, whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks. She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes. operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code. The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the desk and the radio unit. a message in Morse:
Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian	corpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence other than Fran's. whoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She looks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching vehicle can be seen. steps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran. throws it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He finds a toolbox. shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back. Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked and aimed. suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision. Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It rushes toward the launch docks. shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock boards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle directly at her head.
The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the	Guard House. while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the progress of the approaching vehicles. ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF. spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is almost a mile long. helicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle. THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE...

WE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER.
The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the	dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches. HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD? CAN'T DRIVER MYSELF!
Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another	carton rushing back to the launch. WE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH! vehicle, we see a third light in red. It is the spinning "bubble-gum-machine" of a Squad Car. It is heralded by one blast of the car's siren.

It seems to take forever for the Police Car to pull down the	dock.

A few private planes dot the area, but the tower is empty. The J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside the tower windows. blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust from the dry earth. Sheets of old newspaper and other light debris are sent flying through the air in all directions.
One piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one	of the little sheds. It sticks against the glass for a moment, as though glued there, then it flutters to the ground. As the paper clears the glass, we see the face of a badly scarred Zombie peering out through the window. immediately checks the fuel pumps.

Most of them are open wide, the planes they housed long gone. One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still closed and locked with chains and padlocks.

Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna inside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they are confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them through the dust cloud from the chopper. fuel tank. In the roar of the engine, he cannot hear anything else. to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger. still for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again. forming a triangle. boxed in by the hangars.

Stephen roots around among the greasy tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge hammer. He runs out of the shed. Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming against the ghoul's skull with all his might. pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in the dust. run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has turned around and is walking up the grade. sees the frightened couple making for the chopper. Roger from behind. Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun holster. its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap. woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in the propeller draft.
The Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars	almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and advances steadily toward the helicopter. creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall. two more rounds. alongside.

They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door. that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes against its brother. their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession. First one creature falls; then the other. disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition. Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door of the chart house. Behind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward. Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun. The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room. sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears with his rifle.

Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an instant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle aimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead. IT'S SCARY. ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT? his weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his feet.
Roger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the	chopper. Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear without saying another word. the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger climbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable space beside Peter. The big black offers the woman a sip of water, which she accepts. Then she lets her head flop wearily against the rear bulkhead. papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of the incident. GET OUT ALIVE. WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE. AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE THINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY. NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY! Roger stops him by speaking urgently. BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE.

The outer walls are all concrete, and their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground. There are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot. painted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area are parked randomly, some with their doors open wide. see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the roof of the building. several of the living dead. They look almost like normal shoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering walk is unmistakably stiff. At one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked by several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and surrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly. and far between. They move with no seeming purpose. We do not yet see the mall interior. The Zombies pay no attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead.
On the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin,	the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot. Roger: WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'T GET UP HERE. Steve: YEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE! Roger trots away. Peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He stares through one of them and can see into the mall below. Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles. Peter: MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164 The vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior, a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy metal cage gates down and locked into position. One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter the stores, except for the one which is un-gated.
Halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings	the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage- gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead creatures are evident on the balcony. FLOOR. FLOORS. takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of the otherwise flat surface. Roger follows. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? WHY DO THEY COME HERE? SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY THEIR LIVES.
Below, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the	plaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out of the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the floor loudly.
We see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an	intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of the roof surface. Behind the structures can be seen a large power generator.

There is absolutely nothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey. array of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them. large drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the line of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D.
Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a	hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to the floor below. rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights. We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it is very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of Civil Defence supplies. its feet in the sunray. It is Peter. Instantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across the large room. Silence. floor.179 The two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food cartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes quickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight. In a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window above. the cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an anxious Stephen.181 Peter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the enormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to one of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready. Peter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a sudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all but pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger. people are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies. room is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through skylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but for the one Peter opened. Roger: DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183 In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the cartons. Roger: YOU BRING A CAN OPENER?

The door swings open, this time onto a very small space. Again no immediate danger. of a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the air is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling, but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into blackness.

Near the pyramid under the open skylight, the group of refugees	sits on the floor. in his hair. Roger leans against the pyramid and Peter sits in the lotus position, his gun across his legs, squarely facing the suspicious stairwell. He and Roger still pick at their food.

I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN 'EM. WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.
Roger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door	where he begins to remove the barricade of cartons. Peter still sits, checking his own guns. FROM...LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT... WE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED. LEAVE HIM BE. WE'RE GOIN' OURSELVES. snaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber. He hands it to the woman. Peter: THAT'S READY TO SHOOT. BE CAREFUL. Fran holds the gun gingerly. Peter: THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES REAL EASY, BUT THE WEAPON'LL KICK YOU GOOD WHEN IT FIRES. BE READY FOR THAT. TAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT OUT TO THE PARKIN' LOT. YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE. eyes. She has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers' decision is made. WE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME. YOU UNDERSTAND?190 In the dimly lit firestair, the door on the top landing pulls open suddenly. The stairway is still empty. The Troopers move slowly out onto the landing. They look down into the darkness below. Then they move slowly and silently down the steps. Fran appears on the upper landing. She stands in the doorway clutching the rifle. Peter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened woman. Peter: YOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING. JUST DON'T PANIC, OK. THE FIRE. his flashlight and shines the beam around. He is in a very small concrete space. The stairs go down no further. There is only one door. Peter eases down the steps behind. Roger: THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP THERE.192 We see the other side of the metal door. It stands in another it is fully lit. The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet. Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193 Down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some doors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there is nothing. The far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out onto the second story of the mall proper.194 The men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor. They try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is wide open. Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196 The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code to another map of the mall showing electrical installations. On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys, also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings and Roger steps up behind him. Roger: THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197 Back in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and throws the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices, in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next, with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198 The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199 Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They can only see a small section.200 The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can be seen. They are both gated and shut. The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper. They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to opposite walls in the corridor.202 As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer around their respective corners.
The upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the	building, and at several points bridges across from one side to the other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length of the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches for a large department store. Most of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big department stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of the second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on the balcony.204 The two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the sight is even more spectacular.205 Stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items. Everything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods and natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record Store, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift Shop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items. And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each end of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department Stores; great symbols of a consumer society. Down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and park benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist another Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where mothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings. There is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now still, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable displays futuristic household appliances. The images are all too familiar, but in their present state they appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and Customs of a civilisation now gone.
The ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the	mind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of the great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from the Troopers' perspective. Peter: FAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT. Roger: WE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE. THEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE. the administrative corridor. Then they move quickly down the hall toward the Maintenance Office. away a Zombie staggers out of one of the open stores. It is followed by a second creature, a female without one arm. They are moving along the balcony toward the open corridor. against the coded map on the wall. BE LOCKS (he points) FRONT...SIDE...BACK OUTSIDE, MUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKS...BUT WHAT ARE THESE? the big Department Store they are studying. Roger: WASHROOMS...EQUIPMENT...I DUNNO. Roger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still Roger: HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC? Peter: WHAT?210 The big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls on the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens of master switches which are in the off mode. Peter: POWER SWITCHES. Roger: THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE. Peter: HIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT. produced music designed to lull a shopper's brain.212 Upstairs, Francine startles at the sound from below. She snaps the rifle into her hands, ready to fire. She has been standing just inside the storage area. She steps into the firestair and looks down into the darkness. The sounds of the insipid music drift up to her. She leans into the storage area again. STEPHEN!
Steve, still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid,	slowly awakens.214 Down on the first floor of the big mall, things begin to work. The automobile turntable starts spinning; the great escalators move up and sown. Two of the living dead, caught just starting up two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the mechanical steps begin moving.
Lights blink on the exhibits, and mechanical window displays	begin their robot-like motions. It is like a Carnival coming alive. The Zombies which wander the floor look about in confusion. Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving exhibits.215 In a very tall cage, which reaches from the first floor all the way to the ceiling, the Tropical Birds which are housed within begin to flutter and squawk.216 In a pet shop, there are puppies and kittens in a window display. They whine and scramble over one another in fright at the noise and the motion and the coloured lights.217 On one of the floor exhibits, a rear-projection movie starts. It is a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate Developer's new tract of suburban houses. A narrator speaks in a friendly voice: ... and for prices which anyone can afford, you can live in these luxurious new homes by Brandon. Fully electric, central air, ..etc. their raid. Peter secures the vital key ring to his utility belt and the move out.
Peter and Roger move down the Hall and exit through door to	exterior corridor. confronted by the Zombies from the balcony. He startles and ducks back into the room. The closest Zombie is reaching out with clutching hands. Peter raises his gun and fires two shots cleanly through the creature's head.220 As the shots ring through the area, Fran, standing at the top of the firestair, startles. Steve grabs the rifle from the woman. THEY'RE MANIACS. arm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires his weapon. The creature falls in a heap. Roger: WHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT? Peter: YOU GAME? Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall. Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important
The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for	it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222 The battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering strides.223 Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224 A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its balance holding on to the hand rail. At another point down the length of the mall, there is a stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second floor. Several creatures move up the steps. steps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the STEPHEN PLEASE! the two Troopers come to a crashing stop.
There is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage	point, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about three hundred feet away.
Roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the	creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the big roll gate. He fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks the proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor. The tumblers turn successfully. Peter: ALRIGHT!
On the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps	are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective. locked. Peter: YOU BASTARD! Roger: WHAT? ON THE SIDE... fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to shoot when something catches his eye. The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle to stand.235 Roger looks back over his shoulder.236 The Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and fifty feet away. lift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far left. Peter moves to it quickly.238 On the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to take note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239 The Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach the Department Store. ROOF...243 Steve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall. the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three feet above Peter's fingertips.245 The Zombies advance.246 Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach the gate.247 The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily. heavy for him to move himself.
Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help	drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back, but is not dead. on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into the store. Now Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up on the counter. Peter: BEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...
The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics	display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The creature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts to bring it down. clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the gate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down. Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more leverage. The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms. Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate, but the pressure is too great. Roger: LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...
The gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their	hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through, but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse. With his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War. Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching upward. Peter: COME ON...COME ON... Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate. Peter: THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY. Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks solidly into place.
The two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still	moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it. There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the Department Store and several others are making their way along the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor. Roger: WELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA GET BACK? Peter: LET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.
The two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures	outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect. washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices.
At the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from	the open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then it blinks out with a click as the door closes. Fran: STEPHEN...JESUS GOD... goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor, the surroundings are eerily quiet.255 He moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle, where he finds Peter. a small television.
Peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something	which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods. Roger: OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT? Peter: WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GET WHAT WE CAN. toss things into the barrow. supplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes in a store to grab whatever they can.259 Stephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and electrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260 At the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey where many creature still claw at the roll gate.261 The Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their prey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there.
Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and	start toward the offices. the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all the workings and layout of the huge structure.264 Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second storey aisles of the big store.265 Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate. When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266 They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles. They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than they see the lower level-roll gate.267 There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them are at the gate. Peter: LET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE! speaks to the creature. gate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch. The gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds tightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no immediate danger. Peter: LET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...
Other creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department	Store. They lumber along attracted by the sounds. Troopers back away, but stay in sight of the creatures. commotion below. They begin to move away from the gate and lumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators. loaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt. He moves to the large cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272 In the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the executive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273 Several creatures fall over one another as they try to move down the up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first floor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the Department Store. In the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate. Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the metal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other creatures lumbering down the stationary steps. attention of the creatures at the gate. Peter: RIGHT HERE, BABIES...THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT... YOU DUMB ASS SUCKERS...YOU DUMB...YOU ARE DUMB! moves through the second floor aisles stealthily.277 Stephen takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office. He walks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the exterior corridor. As the door opens, the Zombies attack. The Zombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the door on Zombie 13's arm. Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor. Fran call out.

His feet slide on the linoleum floor. He cannot get the door closed this time. Biting his lip, he makes the sign of the cross, and backs suddenly into the room holding his rifle high. The door flies open with a slam, and three Zombies advance into the office. Stephen tries to aim carefully, and he fires. hesitates for a moment, then runs toward the entrance arch. gunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism.
Along the balcony, some of the creatures turn around in con-	fusion. They walk this way and that, attracted by the sound. IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.

Roger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to	the handles of the barrow. through. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break into the Maintenance Office. holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor. The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it. of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies.
The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures	which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly. creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the opening of the Administrative corridor. metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others are still too far away to waste bullets. maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out. firestair, his rifle poised. barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail, but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310 Roger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other creatures throughout the area are again converging on the The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317 Peter: COME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE! run past the Zombies. keeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path. Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The creature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward the mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the creatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall where Peter waits. Peter: NOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321 The two men run across the balcony. They slam into two other Zombies which clutch and grab at them without success.
At the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another	creature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the gate without a problem.
The Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching	and pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely.
The men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing	down the escalator.
On the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they	pull up wheezing with exhaustion.
Roger: LET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE...	WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA. Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles at the young pilot. HOW 'BOUT IT? Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud: with the joy of their victory... The three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which are already gathering at the gate.
Out on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most	are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch.
On the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the	stationary steps and the escalators.
The three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward	the open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one turns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads down the hall toward the firestair. toward the stairway door, which is still open.329 She steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. The shouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the into anger. Fran: SHIT... She takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up. Fran: GOD DAMMIT! She starts back down again. Then it moves back into the hall. men crouch in the shadows of the gate. STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY. FOLLOW US ON UP. IT'S NO GOOD. WE CAN AND GET OUTTA HERE. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE. Roger: OH, MAN... Peter: IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE WITHOUT THEM CATCHIN' ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE. AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH. CHECK OUT THE RADIO. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'... Roger: MAN, I DON'T KNOW... Steve: THERE'S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP OF THE STORES.
The Troopers look at the young pilot, almost surprised to hear	him speak. He has been quiet up until now. IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS. I SAW IT ON A MAP.
The three move off down the aisles, then duck out of sight	around a corner. The Zombies clutch at the metal gate, moaning and rattling the grid loudly.332 In the Maintenance hallway, we see the thick manual lying on the floor. A lumbering foot kicks it as the Zombie in the corridor it does the corpses strewn in the hall.333 In the fire stair, Fran is on the middle landing. She is suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. She clutches at her stomach, retching. She sits on the landing, letting her head ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels. Peter shines his flashlight beam into one. The ceiling is about twelve feet high, but the light beam penetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above.338 Roger: LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH. Peter: THEY'RE LOCKED. SAW ON THE CHART. Roger: WHAT? Peter: THEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGH 'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING. Steve: OVER HERE.339 Steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the doors. Peter: THE ELEVATOR SHAFT! He moves over and hits the button. The doors open. Peter: HOLD 'EM. Roger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car doors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches up for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub- headed bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen. Then the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340 He looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this way and that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall. DRIVER AND SOMETHIN' TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE. TABLES. furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table. The elevator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he has to hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already climbing out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to hold the doors open and goes to get another. This time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top. He climbs up and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors close again.342 In the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevator mechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight. Peter: IT'S ALRIGHT...WE CAN GET IT OFF.

Roger: ONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344 Steve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to work on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345 Fran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very quiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head snaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There is a thump at the door. Slowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the door below. Fran: STEPHEN! figure of the Zombie moves into the firestair. Choking back a scream, Fran turns and runs up the stairs. The creature below follows, unsure of itself in the dim light. door. For a moment, she just backs away in terror. Then she gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a barricade. She struggles with one of the cartons. It is very heavy and so large she cannot get a good grip. The smooth cardboard slips in her hands.347 The Zombie has almost reached the middle landing. Roger looks down through a ceiling grid. He sees the interior of a Sporting Goods Store. Along one wall is an arsenal of the latest weaponry for the sportsman.349 Roger: SWEET JESUS! Peter: I SEEN IT. COME ON! The men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the entire length of the mall. They move as quietly as they can. There are several side tunnels branching off in both directions. full equipped radio and electronics shop. THIS IS IT. COME ON. finally and moves to haul another. door move.

She is about to opt for the skylight, when she glimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as the creature finally breaks into the big room. sack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out: ammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try to deal with the paper wrapping. pyramid of cartons. at the mark. immediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the cylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again. Now, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the items and knocks and rolls the other flares.
Fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright	flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness. The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature and throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and wall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over the articles on the floor.
Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra	cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening. She circles around to a point where she can climb up from behind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares and crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the Zombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid. skylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops two flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's eye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.
Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both	hands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes and wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress; its hands can almost touch Fran's foot. legs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on with his hands to soften his landing. large chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun. Peter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some days earlier, the President, shot himself in the head. THE DESK...GIMME A HAND.
The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the	President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action. his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of the President's wife and children.
Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself	down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk. a crack and peeks out. to the exterior corridor. and slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the door to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves backwards toward the fire stairs. corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening. backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve notices that the fire stairs door is open wide. Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps. COME ON...YOU GOT IT. doorway, Roger breaks up the steps.
The woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the	flare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands. The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks. Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger delivers a blow with his gun, straight down. sobbing and choking. YOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY... items. He dumps them on the floor. help and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets some water in a can and brings it over. HURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE... see the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment. Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door. OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF...
In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies	into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go downstairs for another load. IS PERFECT.

We also head a faint electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it. the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the Department Store's Gourmet department. eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered necessary by a consumer society.
They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which	Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at first. the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set. THAT MEANS THEY'RE SENDING. dial getting nothing but static. Finally, he hears a signal and tunes it in.

Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department	store. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the Zombies.

There is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses	the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment. DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY. WANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS. THERE'S FOUR OF US, OK? HANDLE YOURSELF. THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND LEARN TO FIGHT.
The big man starts back up the pyramid. Roger moves to	follow him. looking at Stephen. HOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER. OUT OF HERE. then up at the other men.
Stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly	setting his rifle down on the cartons. Then he fishes in his pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun. He stares at the woman angry and hurt. IT. still. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to his side. understanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. Fran just shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs with exasperation. weapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the television. Only Stephen is on board at the controls.
In the cab of one of the big trailer trucks Roger is crouching	working on the wiring beneath the dashboard. complicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other controls. Then he pulls out. He stops the big vehicle with his cab just abreast of the cab Roger is working in. ground between, there are a few Zombies scattered about in little clusters. None of them present any immanent danger. THIS THING... across the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the roadway. Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following the trucks as closely as he can. big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the trucks as closely as it can. but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The creatures lumber along slowly behind.
The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the	mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building. moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the creatures turn and face the trucks. up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other flying back.
The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall	entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough for the creatures to get out.
The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering	at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab. truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab. there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab. of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the lot.
The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of	the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind from the chopper whipping her hair. it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse down the road.
Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig	pulls up beside another of the parked vans. immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables.
From the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving	around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck. in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily. can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man. child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't notice. pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight for him.
The big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around	heading back for Roger. creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the complicated shift mechanism fights him.
One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of	Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted among the controls and the shift sticks. not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they claw at the desperate Roger. his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention. Roger's cab. long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the struggling Trooper. great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it.

He raises his rifle and aims, but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering helicopter. creature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a stranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his might. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's fingers push at the man's eyes. tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window. The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp, but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic. He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion. He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions. smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon. in the way... off on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures head. does his body. WE GOT A LOT TO DO...ROGER... open his door and step out when suddenly Roger sits up again. The engine of the truck roars. He seems to have calmed down some. He looks across at Peter. of the area. Peter follows suit.

The two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking	lot and again, the chopper zooms right over the roof. continues through the entire action. The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building as the trailer blocks off the entrance. This time there are still creatures alive in the immediate area. They clutch at the cab of the truck and leap at the doors. the bravery of the moment. As she sees the creatures converging on the truck, she aims her rifle at them. Before she fires, Peter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast. One Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still alive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at Peter's driver side window. side, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open enough to get out. He rolls down his window. Peter has noticed Roger's door won't open, and the Trooper fumbles with the gear shift in order to pull away, but he hears Roger shouting: Roger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into firing position. One or two Zombies are squeezing through the narrow space between the truck. They are just about to reach Roger when he fires, killing the lead ghoul. More Zombies move around Roger's cab, moments away from him.
The helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies	converge on the cab. into the pack of creatures. Her hair covers her eyes and she brushes it away with irritation.
Roger fires again and again down the narrow space between the	rigs. Another Zombie falls. a very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as he tries to level off another shot. out the window. He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on his gun. Peter leans over, trying to get a shot at the creature, but can't get a clean sight. Roger grabs the window frames on Peter's door and tries to pull himself up. Another creature grabs him from behind. It narrowly misses a creature. Fran fires again. Her shot tears into the shoulder of the Zombie, but it doesn't stop him. but Roger, using both hands, brings his gun butt in an uppercut. It slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives the thing staggering back. Then with a desperate driving motion, Roger climbs through the window of Peter's cab. out the window. The Zombies grab at Roger's ankles, and one manages to hold on as the truck starts to move. and falls, rolling across the pavement. The woman fires again, hitting the pavement. The creature struggles to its knees. She fires again and hits the creature's neck. Again. Shoulder. Again...head. The Zombie sprawls on the pavement. Fran is exultant, she aims and fires at another creature. OTHER TRUCK. BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY! him back against the door of the cab. YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE! somewhat out of his emotional rush. ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT? and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot. sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen. and the chopper buzzes back over the lot.
Her hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle	ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon pulling the shells from her blouse pocket. Zombies in the vicinity.
Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original	cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are strewn over the seat and floor. between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab. falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his pack and is grabbed from behind. pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball.
Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and	onto the floor of the cab.
The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the	man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound. Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw. The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of the door, but they slip. falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his hand gun. Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs. at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the window when another creature grabs him. big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his might. kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf. Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op material from Roger's trousers. accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear. Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important morsels. tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its prize. She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head. by the corpse without taking notice. tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his teeth in anguish. I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT.
The wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg	with a torn off piece of trouser. He can hardly keep from screaming, and his words come out sharply and with great breaths between them. AGAIN...THERE'S A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE...BEFORE YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME... drives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper.
There is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main	entrances to the mall. They are very close to the doors, if not completely flush. Some of the glass portals can be opened not slightly, but not enough for the Zombies inside to pass through.
In the parking lot, the creatures mob around the trucks,	frustrated that they cannot pass into the building. They clutch and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to climb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the trailers. mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under the trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out, so it is very clear that some access could be had by the creatures if they were more organised. push open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They behave as a swarm of insects. although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty brains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the rotating action and enters the concourse. They are back in the crawl space. The cartons are still piled against the firestair entrance. INSIDE. THAT'S A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE ENTRANCES. SOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS. his leg. The wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth. The first aid kit is open on the floor. Peter crouches near his friend. He takes over from Fran. He ties more strips tightly around the wound and around the upper thigh. grid and lands on the floor of the Sporting Goods Store. It is Peter. His rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his back. Several of the Maintenance Room key rings are strapped into his belt. balcony is open on this store. Another creature, attracted by the commotion, starts through the open entrance arch. equipment strapped onto his body. He sees the charging creature. Peter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things flying. creature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is moving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a nearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a few steps before it falls. counter top, Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and he swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and clawing. creature outside. Peter jumps down from the counter.
OPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL. BULLET'LL WIND UP	CHASIN' US AROUND IN HERE. Stephen startles. the racks of weapons. He pulls down a gorgeous high powered rifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for sighting. THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS GUN...IS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT.
The cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged	forehead of the Zombie, which is thrashing against the roll gates. The sight gives up a sense of the super-weapon's lethal accuracy. where he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns. several other rifles from the rack. We recognise the firepower in the arsenal that the two men accumulate. YOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE, SISSIES... WE COMIN'...AND WE READY!
With a swell in the music, the band of all four humans charges	out of the Maintenance corridor and makes a break for the Department Store. They all wear new double holsters containing hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first supply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart before him.
There are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things	turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos. Roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times at some of the creatures who are closest. the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators. The corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still clutters in the area.
Fran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the	Department Store. Steve falls immediately on the gate locks. Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall. which are converging along the balcony. He lift his new Super-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars eloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the creatures. third. Roger fires several times. final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up. Steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp. Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of the advancing creatures reach the area.
Again, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are	already running through the aisles of the big store. first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down.
The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded	man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely on the Trooper's shoulder.
Something very serious is shared between the two men, some	knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle. into the first floor on the big store.
Fran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster	than the steps themselves.
They run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches	up several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas into her back pack.
With a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot	flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds two torches as Stephen lights them.
Peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in	front of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into sudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid but it holds as usual. all converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They push and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and the creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves to the extreme left. BY THESE RIGHT HERE... concourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the Department Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a truck trailer. THOSE DOORS! new automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast and manoeuvrable. with pain, but he moves efficiently. ends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out. Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away. Steve un-locks the middle lock. but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about, knocking other Zombies back. Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit. There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path. CLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE... still inside the store with one of the torches.
Steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it	slams shut with a metallic crash. looks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart. They advance slowly. Stephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate. The big ring doesn't fit through the small openings. them with his torch. They back off slightly. pained Roger levels off several shots, but he is very shaky from his extreme pain. He manages to down one of the Zombies. ghouls. Stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock. The Zombies converge on him. cart again. he manages to dodges two little clusters of the walking dead.
The lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs Stephen from	behind, Fran tries to aim her torch closer. It disarms the Zombie for a moment, Stephen thrashes his body back knocking the think off balance. Then he quickly slides the keys under the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single lock undone.
Another ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch	is knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds her torch high. are on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the floor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He crawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and tugging at his pants and shirt. away enough for him to crawl to an open space. Then he scrambles to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car. lumbering creatures close at hand. The big trooper raises his rifle. Roger, using all his strength, manages to pull himself up out of the cart. He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the oncoming ghouls. The super-gun scores two perfect hits. rolls against the car. The turntable carries him around toward another creature. He is struggling in pain toward the driver's door of the vehicle.
Roger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature	grabs him. The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound, which is already leaking blood through its dressing. Roger screams loudly. hood of the car. His super-gun drills a hole through the creature's skull. It falls off the exhibit. the Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door. Peter helps him. The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the seat. Roger immediately goes to work under the dash. platform. He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of the back seat. They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons are locked. Roger works as quickly as he can.
Several of the lead creatures reach the turntable. Some fall	trying to step onto the moving disc, but others manage to struggle over to the car. They smash the windows with their hands. It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the shiny, new car which spins very slowly in circles. now trying to see the action, but it is out of her line of vision. She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and pounding on the car. She turns the valve on her propane nozzle extinguishing the flame.
The Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into	position behind the wheel. He is shaking, but he bites his lip and slams the car into gear. There are at least eight creatures crawling over the car, more approach. The platform spins. Roger waits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse. The men in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at the windows. The ugly and distorted faces press close against the safety glass. spinning display, knocking several of the creatures aside. The front wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor, but the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is stuck for a moment. The disc spins on carrying the rear of the car with it. Then Roger gives it more gas. The rear wheels spin and finally catch. cling for a moment, but they fall away quickly, scrambling to regain their footing and follow. crash against the columns on the concourse. Roger manages to control it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous energy.
One of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept	the speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as though he were a bowling pin. the main entrance which she can see from her position.
The Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall	attracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse easily breaking their ranks.
Roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching	tailspin, stopping just at the doors.
The big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some	creatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are struggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as though it will be able to enter. directly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws its arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The door slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They are all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism. THROUGH. NO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK.. GIMME THE ALARMS... operated burglar alarms. Peter activates the units, stands them against the base of the now locked doors. As he crouches near the glass, creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the glass doors. They cannot get in. THEY CAN'T GET IN...
The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting	close to the action. the wheel.
Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing	Zombies. They fall and scatter. Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice on the woman's walkie talkie. staggering weakly after the car. doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to look down the concourse.

The gun roars and the head in the scope explodes with red.
The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the	brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon. the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow piece of music starts to build. They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail. revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the glass panels and they have no tools to pound with.
The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering	added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They are the early warning devices against penetration. corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the building. It is like a battlefield after a war. railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms.
We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building.	Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven. drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near the firestair.

Fran has been trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out to Stephen and Peter.
The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the	cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall. CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED. UNIT... THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HOURS. sweating even more profusely than before. to clear his eyesight. around the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other room.
The man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big	storage area bouncing off barren walls.
A hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people	are working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls making a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the new partition look like a finished wall. array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which has obviously been used. PERFECT. driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a perfect match. IT OFF? They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony. It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away. the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom.

The clean walls are lined with drawers and doors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men approach the piles of money, stooping down.
Peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at	him quizzically. looks about the enormous vault. THINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE UP.

She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid out in an unused part of the storage area. brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near the bed, with a reading light.

There is a small portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator, and cabinets with dishes and silverware. crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings hung, knick knacks on the tables.

The three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their	supper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP?
Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the	TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table. Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene.

GETTIN' IN THERE TO STOCK UP? THREE OF US. COULDN'T YA USE THREE MORE GUNS? NO CHANCE. She picks the little dog up in her arms.
There's a long silence. The radio sputters static. Voices are	heard, but they aren't speaking into the microphone. They are obviously conferring among themselves. Steve starts to speak, Peter cuts him off.
More static. Slight laughter is heard. Steve looks into Peter's	face. The bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving. Finally, the voice again. REAL BAD! WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SHARE.
Under the cover of darkness, a pair of hands stores a microphone	on a portable radio unit. The radio is in a small van which is cluttered with junk. An arsenal of weapons is strewn about. They look like banditos. One even wears a Mexican sombrero. The men are armed to the teeth, wearing ammunition belts criss- crossed on their chests.

The Zombies in the area clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The woman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her window. She squeals back to the main biker group.
The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of	motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They, too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind the bikes. The men still whoop and shout.
On the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming	roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside.
At the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies	that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables. FOR US... windows. Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store. victory goes up from the raiders.
