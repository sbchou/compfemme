MCCLANE	As far as I'm concerned, progress peaked with the frozen pizza.
HOLLY	We're going to land about thirty minutes late, I wanted you to know. Kids okay?
MCCLANE	Just speeding on sugar, thanks to your parents. I really appreciate you coming a day late, honey. Nothing I like better than a weekend with the Munsters.
HOLLY	Mom give you any trouble about borrowing her new car? No... not yet. Uh...how 'bout if when you land, we don't drive over the river and through the woods to Grandma's house, but check into the Airport motel?
HOLLY	You're on, Lieutenant. They both hang up. The OLDER WOMAN beside Holly smiles at her.
OLDER WOMAN	Isn't technology wonderful?
HOLLY	My husband doesn't think so.
OLDER WOMAN	Well, I do. I used to carry around those awful mace things - She opens her purse and displays a Taser stun gun. Now I zap any bastard who screws with me. I tried it on my little dog, poor thing, limped for a week. As Holly tries to smile politely, we

MCCLANE	No. Just a little professional courtesy.
LORENZO	In an airport Christmas week? You gotta be kidding.
MCCLANE	Okay. Forget the courtesy. How about lust the professional? Your boys dust walked away from a crime scene - you need to seal it off, get a forensics team in, dust it, shoot
LORENZO	And what do we do with all the luggage for all the airplanes while we play Charlie Chan?
MCCLANE	You store them somewhere -
LORENZO	Oh. And meanwhile every hour a few more thousand people come and they want to put their luggage on airplanes, so we store them and their luggage in some other "somewhere"? Hell, why don't we shut down the whole fucking airport? Whaddya think they'll say upstairs when I tell them that?
MCCLANE'	Why don't you try it and find out?
F LORENZO	Because I don't need a forensics investigation to file away some punk stealing luggage -
MCCLANE	Luggage? That "punk" pulled a Glock Seven on me. Know what that is? A porcelain gun from Germany. It doesn't show up on airport x-ray machines... and it costs more than you earn in a month.

MCCLANE	What?
POWELL	Yup. S/Sgt. Oswald Cochrane. American advisor in Honduras, killed in helicopter accident 5/11/88. Read between the lines of his military record and it looks like a lot of black bag stuff.

SAM	Okay. The guy makes Geraldo look like Walter Chronkite. Doesn't mean you can't cut me some slack. I saw the stiff. Word is that was your handiwork.

TRUDEAU	That's what I said about my last cholesterol test. What's your problem- Lieutenant McClane?
MCCLANE	I think something serious is going to happen here tonight -
TRUDEAU	Hey. Something serious happens every night, only it doesn't make the newspapers. Ever see those guys on TV, juggling knives and cha n i saws? That's what we're doing with those planes up there, only we do it one handed 'cause the other hand's playing 3 card monte with the planes on the ground.
MCCLANE	Anybody try and fix the deck tonight? Anything weird going on besides the shooting?
BARNES	We did. lose FAA approach control-
MCCLANE	What's that?
TRUDEAU	One way we manage the planes. But we've got backup - Long look from McClane.

TRUDEAU	How. did you get on this line? Who is this?
STUART	Who I am is unimportant. What I want... well, if you don't want those planes overhead to start dropping like flies when they run out of fuel... what I want is very important. All REACT - McClane as much as anyone. A plane is going to be landing at this Airport in 58 minutes. It is FM 1 - Foreign Military 1.
MCCLANE	Esperanza? Trudeau nods -
STUART	This plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department. But now there will be a change of plans. This plane will not be met by anyone. It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested. That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it. At the same time, I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled.
95 FAVORING MCCLANE 95	As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over
MCCLANE	What's all that about?
BARNES	A 747 has the furthest flight capacity of anything we've got here. Take out the seats and save some weight, add the wing tanks and it could go to Australia, Africa, Asia - hell the whole Goddamn world.'
MCCLANE	Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there's no extradition treaties.
LORENZO	They're talking to us on our own Goddamn system! They gotta be close - I'll have my men tear this airport
MCCLANE	About time, Carmine. Guess you have to light a fire under your ass to light a fire under your ass.
LORENZO	McClane, I got a first class unit here, SWAT team and all, and we don't need any Monday morning quarterbacks.
MCCLANE	Monday morning? My wife's on one of those planes these aasstards are fucking with! That makes me a player on the fucking field, you putz! And if you got off your fat ass when I told you to, maybe we wouldn't be knee deep in shit right now!
LORENZO	Security! You're out of here! And already two big Airport cops are trotting over. As Trudeau

LORENZO	And Lorenzo here, with two unauthorized personnel in the fucking tower! Get your thumb out of your ass and get over to the elevator. Get them out and post a guard or you're gonna have a pink slip in your Christmas stocking! Rattled, the guard signals a comrade, hustles to obey.

TRUDEAU	Get what you need. Borrow, steal, kill.
LORENZO	I want my Swat team to go with him as cover. Whatever we can think of - they can think of, too. He says it like he thought of it himself. Then -
STUART'S VOICE	Attention, Tower. You have two more minutes to stack the planes in your inbound pattern over your outside radio marker. After that you will be able.to receive only. Any attempt to restore your systems will be met by severe penalties. At the elevator, Lorenzo pauses - stage WHISPERS -

STUART	I am doing this.
TRUDEAU	Put me on all bands... Trudeau waits as switches are thrown, and then takes the jack
TRUDEAU	This is Dulles approach to all aircraft holding.at Potomic Vortac. We are experiencing... Severe technical problems here.
TRUDEAU(CONT'D)	Our NAV and Approach systems are down and we expect to lose voice in another minute. We want you to continue holding at the outer marker as directed and wait for further instructions. As - as soon as we're back on line we'll expedite your landings on a.fuel emergency basis. Good luck... God bless. He turns to a tech, face ashen.
TRUDEAU	Okay. Change the boards. McClane APPEARS in the gloom close to CAMERA, clothes now a
MCCLANE	I don't believe this... another fucking elevator... another fucking basement... why does this always happen to me? He moves through the cavernous maze, and then REACTS to MUSIC. Or something like it: Here, in an area reached only my somebody The SOURCE of.the music, a 78 SPINNING on the old machine. A HAND reaches for McClane's shoulder.
105 NEW ANGLE 105	McClane's instincts take over; in a flash, he WHIRLS and his
MCCLANE	Who the fuck are you? In response, the man points to the NAMETAG on his coveralls.
MAN (MARVIN)	Marvin, I'm Marvin. Thought you was tryin' to steal my records, that's all. He moves to them, possessively.
MARVIN(CONT'D)	They're valuble, you know. Me, I like those old 78's. Won't find me switching like everybody else to these new fangled 45's. McClane reacts to that, peers at him.
MCCLANE	You're what, the janitor?
MARVIN	Damn straight. Janitor, and proud of it. Don't need any of this new fangled custodial engineer crap. Just do my job and screw the fancy talk. You know, you're not supposed to be down here. Yeah. Just like you're not supposed to be living here.
MARVIN	W-who said I was living here? McClane shows his badge.
MCCLANE	Come on, Marvin. I wasn't born yesterday. Carmine Lorenzo know you don't go home after you punch out?
MARVIN	L-Lorenzo? C-come on, officer, I can barely get by, even with my pension. You know, I'm a vet, WW 2? If it wasn't for guys like me, you kids' be eatin' sushi today. I'm just trying to. save a few. bucks -I could. get fired if you tell. McClane moves over to a big panel with telephone lines and jacks.
MCCLANE	I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And a married one. You married?
MARVIN	Six times.
MCCLANE	My wife may be in some trouble upstairs. I gotta find out. This set up of yours? I won't tell a soul... provided you patch me into this panel, 'let me eavesdrop on the tower. What do you say?
MARVIN	You a cop or a lawyer? I'm sending the SWAT team over for Barnes now - we don't need the Goddamn Christmas tourists seeing guns and flipping out so they'll take him the long way around...
LORENZO'S VOICE	Through the annex skywalk to the new terminal... that way nobody sees them, we don't have any panic.
TRUDEAU'S VOICE	And we don't want any disasters. Barnes has five minutes to check out that antenna array.
MCCLANE	Christ. They're gonna try something cute... where's this annex skywalk?
MARVIN	Annex skywalk...? Sounds like the pissant World's Fair... He rummages around, finds a big wrinkled MAP, smoothes it out.
MARVIN(CONT'D)	Lemme see... yeah, must be this... connects to the new terminal - Marvin points to an ELEVATED WALKWAY connecting the two
MCCLANE	Shit, it's a fucking bottleneck. Anybody smart enough to shut down the airport is smart enough to figure this... it's a perfect place for an ambush...
C) AN L.E.D. DULLES MAP -	all of it useless, all of the operators watching their only hope A MOUND of CRINKLED PAPERS is FLATTENED against the card table.
MARVIN	Now, see? Here's you. And here's the skywalk. Now, check this out...
MCCLANE	Tunnels. Like the Japs had all over Iwo Jima. That's where I got wounded. But we put those little twerps in their place once and for all. These are air ducts for all the terminals. Heating, cooling. Whole shebang. So I put you in the boiler room where they start, and you come out there.
MCCLANE	Looks like... maybe a mile. Easy jog. Uh-uh. It's a pisser of a crawl. And that's the easy part; firs you gotta be an acrobat.
MCCLANE	Whoa.
MARVIN	Winter up there... Summer down here. He aims Marvin's flashlight down there, isn't enchanted with what
MCCLANE(CONT'D)	I owe you one, Marvin. How about a sixpack of malt liquor?
MARVIN	How 'bout a case of Johnny Walker? Hey, I may be homeless, but I ain't tasteless.
BARNES	We're in the annex skywalk. I can see the dish! I'll call you as soon as it's hot for a protocol test.

139 HIS POV 139	LIGHTS in the sky: Other airplanes.
140 WIDER 140	Holly looks at him. She can't help not looking at him; he's I think you're closer than fifty yards.
THORNBERG	So is that plane... practically. Despite herself, she looks out.
HOLLY	Yeah. There's quite a few out there; we're in a regular traffic jam.
THORNBERG	There's nothing regular about it. I see you're intrigued. That's my gift, Mrs. McClane. I make people curious.
HOLLY	Don't you mean nauseous?
THORNBERG	The people have a right to know, Mrs. McClane. You got in the way of that.
HOLLY	You endangered my children... my husband.. and me. And you didn't do it for anything as noble as "the people". The only time you see the people is when you're climbing over their backs.
BARNES	--me? I'll live. But Lorenzo's (X) SWAT team is dead... and the antenna array is toast. Start looking for (X) a new miracle. AN EERIE ALIEN TYPE VOICE makes them both jump; McClane raises
142 NEW ANGLE 142	It's coming from a TRANSCEIVER beside one of the dead men.
GARBER	I say again, Annex team... report in. Annex team, report in. He looks at Stuart, concerned.
MCCLANE	What...?
BARNES	Some kind of scrambler so even if we scan their frequency we can't listen in. Descramble mode must activate on this code panel. These guys are pros.
MCCLANE	So are you. Break the code -
BARNES	Eight numbers - that's 8 X 7 X 6 times 40,320 possible combinations. Next time you kill one of these guys - get them to enter the code first. Sir, we just monitored a call from their chief engineer. Our people took out their Swat team... completely.
GARBER	You were right... they went for the antenna array. We're right on schedule.
STUART	Except losing our own team wasn't part of the plan. He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice
STUART	Attention, Dulles. You were warned not to try and restore your systems.
STUART'S VOICE	You've wasted lives and time on a futile and obvious target. Now you have to pay the penalty. They HEAR this too, over Barne's cellular tie in to the tower.
MCCLANE	There's five dead officers here, Colonel Stuart - Isn't that penalty enough?
LORENZO	McClane! Keep out of this! You- He stops, seeing the chilling look Trudeau is giving him.
149 STUART 149	has reacted to both the mention of his name and of McClane's.
STUART	McClave? John McClane? The... policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages? I read about you in People magazine. You seemed out of your league on Nightline, though...
MCCLANE	Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous for five minutes. Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV. How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
STUART	I think Cardinal Richlieu said it best: Treason is merely a matter of dates. And this country has to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off men. like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression.
MCCLANE	And lesson one starts with killing policemen? What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb?
STUART	I think we can find something in between. Give me a flight number - one low on fuel. Another man hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, switches to
STUART	Windsor flight one-four-teen, this is Dulles Approach... do you copy?

TRUDEAU	That's the runway between here and the new terminal... he wants to make all of.us watch it.
153 MCCLANE 153	CAMERA PUSHES IN on him as he turns and looks out the window.
BARNES	Don't do it... you bastards, don't do it..! Desperate, McClane runs to the spilled paint, grabs turpentine,
BARNES	What are you doing? Whatever the fuck I can, Barnes... whatever the fuck I can.
PILOT	Ladies and Gentlemen, as you've probably noticed, we've started our descent.
PILOT'S VOICE	We're sorry about the inconvenience, but we'll all be on the ground in a few minutes. The spent and exhausted people REACT. Some break into APPLAUSE
STEWARDESS	Just like British rail, luv. May be.late but we get you there.
156 MCCLANE-FROM OUTSIDE ANNEX 156	Barnes holds one end of.a painter's dropcloth; McClane - now There he's a tiny SHADOW on the white field. He turns, RUNS

A TECHNICIAN	Can't we cut in, jam them -
TRUDEAU	Everything's dead. There's somebody out there - LIGHT SIZZLES in the distance, dances. Trudeau fumbles up a pair
TRUDEAU	Christ. It's McClane. He'll get himself killed - He's made two TORCHES from wads of fabric wound on the scaffold
BARNES	Come on, see the torch, see the Everyone watches the dancing lights and listens to -
PILOT'S VOICE	Dulles, this is Windsor one fourteen. Inside the outer marker.
STUART'S VOICE	Roger, Windsor. This is Dulles Tower. We have radar contact and show you on ILS. You are in the glide path and looking good.
PILOT'S VOICE	Wait a minute... something down there through the snow... looked like a light...

If the 747 we requested is ready on time and General Esperanza lands unmolested, further lessons can be avoided. He DISCONNECTS. Pieces of luggage, fragments of people's lives: Toys, purses, McClane weaves through the workers, glazed eyes looking at the
RESCUE WORKER	Tower, this is Rescue Three. No (X) survivors. Repeat, no surviv- He stops, looking puzzled at McClane, who is torn, bloody.
MCCLANE	Relax, pal, I'm not a survivor. I'm just another victim. He grabs the rescue worker by the collar.
MCCLANE(CONT'D)	.the last fucking victim he'll ever have.

ESPERANZA	Bueno, joven, bueno! Tu eres un soldado excelente! Ahora, en vez del libertad - dame un fosforo? Flattered, the kid lights him up.
GARBER	Sir. They've done everything we've anticpated... so far- Stuart smiles tightly at the unvoiced question.
STUART	Don't worry, Captain. If this goes into extra innings... Well, we'll just call an our man in the other team's locker room. And - almost in afterthought - he wipes the flight number from SAM COLEMAN is on CAMERA, "live" supered over her face. She's
SAM	--hundreds of people in the terminal heard or saw the crash, but still there has been no official word from authorities. Meanwhile - despite the fact that only one runway has been closed due to the tragedy, several dozen airliners are visible from where I stand, endlessly circling the field. Rumors abound that somehow the accident has interfered with normal landing procedures here. Other reports say there were difficulties in the tower before the crash, and that they may have even contributed to it. One thing is certain: With weather conditions worsening, the problem here and in the sky above us will continue to Dulles International Airport.
TRUDEAU	Barnes. We have to warn those planes we got a lunatic down here who likes to pretend he's the tower. Get up to the cab and get us on the air.
BARNES	On the air? With what?
TRUDEAU	With your Goddamn brain! Barnes leaves. McClane blinks, coming around to reality. Sees
MCCLANE	Trudeau... I... I...
TRUDEAU	You don't have to say anything, McClane. We all know how you feel.
MCCLANE	Do you? Do you? I've been a cop 13 years... Everything from... lost kids to hostages... but... all of it was... taking care of business... taking care of peoplle... until tonight. Tonight, everything I did, everything I tried... I never felt so useless.
TRUDEAU	Our own SWAT team's gone. We called the Government for help. They're sending in a special Army unit. Tactical Terrorist Team... McClane sees something else there in his eyes.
MCCLANE	And...?
TRUDEAU	Your wife's plane...? They keep broadcasting, even though we can't answer. They... they'll run out of fuel in 90 minutes. CAMERA PUSHES IN on McClane.
HOLLY	Listen, Dick - That is your name? Dick, if you're going-Eo keep getting this close, you think you could change aftershaves? Anything else?
HOLLY	A stronger mouthwash would be nice. He glares at her, moves down the aisle.

VICTOR	Uh - yeah, what? 1 )l78 CONTINUED - 178
THORNBERG	Did you pack the radio mikes from the shoot, or put them in your carry on?
VICTOR	Are you crazy? I wouldn't let those assholes check 'em -
THORNBERG	I love you. Get one of the receivers. Puzzled, the man pulls his bag from under the seat, gets one out.

VICTOR	4 Should be on our band... He TUNES the mike's receiver, monitoring. with an earplug. Nothing.
THORNBERG	You just said it would work -
VICTOR	It is working. But all I get is... The weather recording. It's like... like the tower isn't there. CAMERA TIGHTENS on Thornberg. Wheels start spinning. Leaving,

GRANT	One crisis... one dozen. Who are you?
MCCLANE	John McClane.
GRANT	McClane... Oh, yeah, you're the one who tried to save that plane tonight. You showed some balls out there, McClane. Now show some sense and let the pros handle things.
MCCLANE	Unfortunately the pros are on the other side. Colonel Stuart is one of your boys - Not any more, he's not. Gentlemen, we are here to take down Colonel Stuart... and we will take him down. You see, I served, with him. And I taught him everything he knows. Yeah. But what if he took some night courses? Grant REACTS, recovers.
GRANT	All right, hustle! Command post will be in the Airport Police office. I want to be tied into the Tower and every sysytem that's still working in fifteen minutes!
SERGEANT	You heard the man, troop! Move it! GEAR and WEAPONS get hustled into the building as the Choppers
MCCLANE	Trudeau. Did things just get better... or worse?
2ND ENGINEER	Lights! Big portable lights! We set up on the field and -
BARNES	And wait for those lunatics to shoot them out? And where do we get those "big portable lights"? Borrow them from Batman?
1ST ENGINEER	Semaphore! That gets my vote-
BARNES	Your vote? You voted for Dukakis! What about the airphone idea?
3RD ENGINEER	Eighteen planes up there; only five have those phones. We got through to three of them, still trying with the others.
BARNES	Great, that leaves thirteen accidents waiting to happen. Are they still bucking headwinds? That's eating up most of their fuel.
1ST ENGINEER	Just checked the weather. Headwinds slamming right into everybody over the outer marker. The planes with enough fuel were already shunted to
ATLANTA -	Suddenly Barnes' expression changes.
BARNES	Damn! The Outer Marker! It's a beacon, right? A radio beacon, that sends out this "boop-boop-boop" so they know they're over it, right?
1ST ENGINEER	So?
BARNES	So, who says that radio signal has to be just "boop-boop boop"? We switch the tower freqency over to the one for the beacon -
BARNES	-and we can talk to the planes and those bas ar s w o did this will never know! And as faces brighten for the first time in hours, we The second Triple T SERGEANT wipes grease from his hands, shows

We will get this from your respective airlines and use it for confirmation. Repeat: the terrorists have cut off the two systems that can allow you to land: The field lights for a manual landing and the ILS for an instrument one. A special US Army unit is already here and preparing to take out the terrorists. CAMERA TIGHTENS on Thornberg: Orgasm.
MARVIN	Hey, officer. Thought you'd be upstairs by now, hanging out with the top brass.
MCCLANE	They kind of busted me down to buck private.
MARVIN	I know that feeling. Interested in a nice coat? The lining's ripped and it needs some invisible mending. Keep it. Think you can get me on line upstairs again? Marvin chuckles, moves over to a table and pulls aside a cloth.
MARVIN	I was just a kid, working those radios on the B-29's. But I kept up. Still read Popular Mechanics. These transistor things, I'm on top of 'em - Marvin realizes that McClane has'a funny expression.

ESPERANZA	I'm all right - he said he was a ,policeman... A policeman - PUSH to Stuart. He knows which policeman...
GARBER	He went in the cockpit -
STUART	He's going to hell.
227 COCKPIT 227	Silence. McClane REACTS to the.two dead men sharing the tiny IT WON'T MOVE. He tries harder.
228 OTHER SIDE OF DOOR 228	A RESCUE AXE is across the door like a barricade. McClane looks worried - and then Garber - the last man - comes up, delayed by locking McClane in

STUART	How many grenades we have?
STUART	Use 'em. Pop. Pop pop pop. Each man PULLS TWO PINS - THROWS - Then they Clunk-clunk-clunkCLUNK. TEN GRENADES land and BOUNCE here like CAMERA PUSHES to it: "EJECT." in one move vaults into the seat, snaps on the belt, grabs the with a WOOSH and a ROAR, the ejection seat ROCKETS UPWARDS, the

STUART	Fall back to the Church! Now! (X) Helping the wounded Esperanza, they vanish into the darkness. BILLOWING as something struggles under it. Where's - the fucking - door? He staggers out from under the yards of silk, COVERED IN SNOW
STEWARDESS	They're getting pretty squirrely back there... in fact, so am I.
PILOT	We're right over Washington... see if you can get any TV. That'll settle 'em down.

THORNBERG	Try Pulitzer, Mrs. McClane. But now that stewardess reaches up and turns on the TV PROJECTOR.
STEWARDESS	Sir, please - we may be landing at any moment -the seat belt light is-
THORNBERG	I- I'm going to be sick - He makes a croaking noise to sell it, stumbles into the lavatory.
THORNBERG	This is Richard Thornberg. Put me through to the News Director. I know he's getting ready for the broadcast, that's why I want him! Now get him or start typing your resume!
MCCLANE	Esperanza's down... but he's hurt. I killed one more man... that's six (X) they've lost all together. Maybe if we knew how many they had to start with, we could get excited. But if they got fifty guys, it's a champagne.
GRANT	McClane, we don't need a loose cannon on this deck. What if they decide to crash another plane in retaliation for your little stunt? r,1 Last I heard, they can't do that again. And if I grabbed Esperanza, the situation would be over.
GRANT	Maybe they're more creative than you
I	think! McClane, we're here to jerk off that cocksucker until he tries to take off - period! This time you're the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time! McClane stands, glares at the two officers. He flips away the
MCCLANE	.The story of my life. But the enlisted men seem sympathetic. And so does
250 BARNES 250	Who now pulls McClane aside.
BARNES	McClane. You said they showed up there right away?
MCCLANE	Stuart's guys? Yeah. That means they're on the field or close -
BARNES	I think I know where. Interested, McClane'follows Barnes around the corner.
251 WHEN THEY'RE ALONE 251	Barnes unfolds some.plot plans.
BARNES	These are the old plans when the longer runways went in... that's twelve years ago. And it looks like they did some modifications on site... moved Tracon, phone, ILS - all the underground stuff -so they could handle drainage. If I'm right, all of it would run along the edge of the airport property - and go right past this neighborhood.
MCCLANE	So - if they know this too - they could be sitting around the fireplace and hanging their fucking stockings in one of these houses?
BARNES	Maybe. Yeah. Well, seventy eighty per cent, five percent either way-
MCCLANE	Are you sure or not?
BARNES	I was sure about tying into the antenna array. And... and I got five officers killed.
MCCLANE	You didn't do that - you did your
BARNES	I had a choice and I made it. But those cops didn't have a choice, and neither do those soldiers now. I'm an engineer, McClane. It's supposed to a wires and circuits... iron and steel. Not flesh and blood. Not lives. If...if I'm wrong again... I don't want anyone else to get orders that could get them killed.
MCCLANE	Then how would you feel about a volunteer?
OLDER WOMAN	Somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess, that's for sure.
HOLLY	It's hard to blame anyone for the
OLDER WOMAN	Yeah? What about that porker Willard Scott? I shoulda taken the bus. At least they can pull over for food and gas.
253 HOLLY 253	I REACTS to what the woman's said. As the Stewardess PASSES, Holly
STEWARDESS.	Yes?

STEWARDESS	Oh, of course we do. They anticipate little proems like this. She moves away. We TIGHTEN on Holly. She's chilled by the lie. HIS BEEPER SHOWS as he CLIMBS something - we WIDEN.

TRUDEAU	That's the most remote building we've got. Stuart looks at his map, then the hanger mentioned; not far.
STUART	We're on our way. If there's another attempt to stop us like the one-you just made, I will fire several Stinger missiles into your terminal. Do I make myself clear?
TRUDEAU	Quite clear.
STUART	Good. Please have a ground crew there to confirm the plane's condition. (X) Grant uses the field radio Telford has set up in the back of the You're quite capable of confirming it yourself, Colonel. Please don't ask us to gift wrap potential hostages for you.

We will take them in the hanger or we will shoot that fucking plane out of the sky. Lorenzo, take your men back to the airport and seal off every exit in case anyone tries to break out on the ground. .You got it.
PRODUCER	Dick, this is nuts - first, you do Siamese Twin drag queens, not hard news; and second, every station in I town has people out at the airport and none of them has heard even a whisper of this shit you're running
THORNBERG	Well, none of them is me. You want proof? Try this - And he PLAYS the MICROCASSETTE. We HEAR Barnes' earlier In the TV station, STUNNED reaction.

NEWSCASTER	News. There was a plane crash earlier this evening at Dulles, where other aircraft continue to circle, with no explanation from Airport or FAA officials. Now, with an exclusive KLA report, here is Dick Thornberg, reporting from the skies over Washington. That gets all the sports fan's attention. Now a SUPER of I Tom., I'm one of the thousand people who has been circling our Nation's capitol, under the assumption that whatever problem was going on far below me was a normal one. But the truth is far from normal - the truth is terrifying. This is a recording of a conversation between Dulles tower and the captive aircraft overhead. With a smug smile, Thornberg plays the tape again. The people LISTEN as the tape of Barne's earlier broadcast PLAYS.
LORENZO	McClane! Are you out of your fucking mind-?
MARVIN	This man's been through serious shit,
I	give him a break-
LORENZO	Who the fuck are you?
MARVIN	Marvin, the janitor. Don't need that. custodial enginner crap - Grant - the Terrorist Team -where are they?
LORENZO	They left to shoot those bastards out of the sky -
MCCLANE	They're not gonna do that -they're gonna get on the same Goddamn plane and leave with him! Before the Army canned him, Stuart must have loaded that unit with his own guys -

He slams the phone down - checks his pistol ammo and rushes out CAMERA PANS AWAY from the terminal bar towards a GIFT SHOP.
THORNBERG'S VOICE	Since then this reporter has learned that the terrorists have virtual control of the entire airport - a fact the authorities have suppressed. The terrorists promise more bloodshed unless their demands are met; and now that special Army Commandoes have arrived at the airport, the liklihood of a full scale and deadly battle is dangerously close -
