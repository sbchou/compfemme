VLADIMIR	Dmitri! I can not work with her! May I remind you that you are supposed to be Princess - not a lazy lumbering lout!

DMITRI	For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. This is the big one. . . and all I need is the right girl. a COMIC VERSION, in which he expresses the hope he can find the right girl for his scam.

VLADIMIR	Who did you hear it from?
ANYA	I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri? though she keeps getting bumped and pulled off by people walking in the opposite direction.
VLADIMIR	Providing travel papers is illeagal! I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you. Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
ANYA	Well, I don't have any money . . .
VLADIMIR	Good day!
ANYA	I have a bike! Perhaps I could sell it and. . . there is no bicycle there anymore - just Meetoo.
ANYA (CONT.)	What are you doing here? And where's my bike?
ANYA (CONT.)	Officer! My bike has been stolen!
POLICEMAN	Nonsense. There is no crime in the Soviet Socialist Republic. in pursuing the policeman so she heads off to find - who has vanished down the street. Meetoo to follow her.
ANYA	Sorry, boy, I have to go.
ANYA (CONT.)	No. You can't come with me. I'm leaving. . .
ANYA (CONT.)	It sounds like you're saying "me too". Listen little guy, I have money, no food. . . and no bicycle. I'm the last person you should be following! in a beautiful golden light. a roatating "spit" which is propelled by a Vladimir is carefully basting the only thing the spit: a head of cabbage.
VLADIMIR	. . . even if we find her, what makes you think the Empress will even see us?
DMITRI	She'll see us. a boarded up window. She looks through a crack in a see BARTOK, the bat who was with Rasputin. his "hair: a quick grooming.
BARTOK	You, uhh. . . hang here often? "Hang" get it? I said "hang" and we're both, you know, cause we're bats. . . and, uhhh. . . what's your sign?
DMITRI	What was that?
VLADIMIR	That was your dinner! I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!

VLADIMIR	You're trespassing, boy! refocus on reality.
ANYA	I. . . I. . . spoke to you earlier about traveling paper. .
DMITRI	It's her.
VLADIMIR	He's her?
DMITRI	Look!
ANYA	Are you Dmitri? I didn't mean to trespass - I don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . . and begin to circle around her.
VLADIMIR	Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . .
DMITRI	She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
VLADIMIR	Ew. . . the honest type.
DMITRI	You look like her. Like the Princess Anastasia. Has anyone ever told you that before?
ANYA	Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me I looked like a princess! Stop that!
stops circling and then begins to use everything	Anya says - the perfect and charming con man that is - to get what he wants.
DMITRI	People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too What happened to your parents?
ANYA	I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
DMITRI	You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
ANYA	I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
DMITRI	Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
VLADIMIR	How much do you weigh?
VLADIMIR (CONT.)	I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
ANYA	Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
DMITRI	Why do you want to go to Paris?
ANYA	I have my reasons.
DMITRI	Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris. We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. And I think you are the Princess Anastasia. then continues with Anya. Vlad smiles to himself walks down the stairs - Dmitri's so good even he got
DMITRI (CON'T)	You never thought of the possibility?
ANYA	Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me! NO! YOU LOOK AT HER! LOOK AT HER! It could be you. it have been a memory. . .
DMITRI (CONT.)	You don't have anything to lose. If I am wrong - the Empress will simply tell us you aren't Anastasia and we'll be on our way. No harm done - an honest mistake - but at least you will be in Paris.
ANYA	THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER. . .
DMITRI	Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
expression registers her internal debate. What is	true. . . It coudn't be. . . but if. . . Then,

DMITRI	The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!

BARTOK	Oy. . . he's gonna be so mad... orange glow of a fire. the largest and most elaborate.
BARTOK	Ummm ... Father Gregori? It's, uhh ... me. Bartok. Phew! Not home ...
RASPUTIN	What?
BARTOK	Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
RASPUTIN	And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
BARTOK	Name calling! That's mature.
RASPUTIN	I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
BARTOK	No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
RASPUTIN	Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
BARTOK	Yeah, right. Keep that thought okay? So, I'm in town, stop by the old palace. You get a better class of bats there - no tattoos or anything.
BARTOK (CONT.)	So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague. Someone's gotta clean that up...
RASPUTIN	Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
BARTOK	Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive. laughs.
RASPUTIN	Impossible. That rumor's been around for years.
BARTOK	Trust me, it's her!
RASPUTIN	How do you know?
BARTOK	Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
BARTOK (CONT. )	Oyyy... I knew this was gonna to upset him! Rasputin flings open the cabinet and we see RELIQUARY, glowing gently as if it were sleeping. covers his eyes in fear. Even Rasputin seem a nervous in front of it.
RASPUTIN	Source of my power. Owner of my soul. I need your help.
BARTOK	Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
RASPUTIN	I cursed then all!
BARTOK	My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound... a smaller doll inside it, etc.) The first doll an eerie resemblance to Nicholas. Inside the looks like Alexandra, all the way down to the doll. the Romanovs once and for all. Bartok will comically throughouut. as Rasputin conjure up tLis minions from the iquary and sing Romanovs FINALE, he sends them off after Anya.
RASPUTIN	The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore to destroy all of them! If she lives, if she should have a child someday, the Romanov Family continues! And I won't lot that happen! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE!
BARTOK	You know, this is really obsessive behavior. There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he feels. . . begins to roll.
RASPUTIN	YOU IDIOT SPIRITS inside swirl around, moaning.
RASPUTIN (CONT.)	Yesses - you'd all like to get out, wouldn' t you? Sorry just one at a time and only when I call. a goblet over his.
RASPUTIN	Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
BARTOK	You'd lose your security deposit?
RASPUTIN	Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ... YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND IF THAT HAPPENS!
RASPUTIN (CON'T.)	Where is she? Where is Princess Anastasia... a train engine. As the reliquary picture broadens, see a train and Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir all hurrying catch it.
RASPUTIN(CONT.)	She has friends. No matter...
BARTOK	Ohhh, that was dumb...
BARTOK (CONT.)	Hello, I've get really terrible claustrophobia. That's why I could never live in a cave ...
RASPUTIN	Finish my prophecy...
BARTOK	Ew, I hate when he does this! see MINION ONE, has the body of a human and a head of JACKAL, MINION TWO has the face of a woman and the of a TIGER, and MINION- the most horrible all - has a huge bear-like body with the head of a All wear long capes with hoods.

TATIANA (CONT.)	No more. So more... nervous chitter.
SOPHIE	Oh, oh... I must say. I thought that one was bar - i'm just so shocked that she wasn't real well, she was real, I mean she was human, of course. but not our real.

I'm a going to think of really hard questions...
TATIANA	No, Sophie. My heart can't take it anymore! I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia.
DMITRI	Hurry up with those papers.
VLADIMIR	Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
VLADIMIR (CONT.)	You probably would. They're still wet.
VLADIMIR (CONT.)	Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
DMITRI	"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
VLADIMIR	What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
DMITRI	Wake up! observes ruefully.

DMITRI	Take my hand! carefully touches his painful noso.
DMITRI	Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?

DMITRI	I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up! toward the train.
ANYA	By pulling my hair?!
DMITRI	I was all out of dynamite! catch up with the train. As the scene continues, we the minions, by one, getting close to the train then disappear from view - only their riderless ride away.

GUARD	That's them! Come on! lets out a HORRENDOUS SCREECH, causing the other to turn around. The Guards scream and reel backward, Anya - it's a SERIOUSLY UGLY WOMAN. The Minions scream and reel back in horror. is no place left to run. Only the engine is of them.
DMITRI	Wait here!
