CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D)	It's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it.
CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D)	You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. script is copyright Â© 1998 John August But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here.
CLAIRE	I'm not saying this is anything it's not. But c'mon. This time yesterday, who'dda thunk it? `X' Christmas MUZAK plays. A baby CRIES.
Containers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the	
RONNA	Paper or plastic? CONTINUED: 4
RONNA	Paper or plastic?
RONNA	Paper or plastic?
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN	Both.
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN	You didn't double my coupons.
RONNA	They're at the bottom. In red. Where it says, double coupons.
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN	You can't do that. You can't put bleach in the same bag as food. It's poison.
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN	Don't think you're something you're not. I used to have your job.
RONNA	Look how far it got you.
CLAIRE	Don't.
SIMON	Why not?
CLAIRE	She's been on for fourteen hours.
SIMON	Ronna?
RONNA	No.
SIMON	I haven't asked you yet.
RONNA	Answer's still no.
SIMON	Are you menstrual? Pre-menstrual, post- menstrual? CONTINUED: 6A
RONNA	One of the three. Okay, Simon. In case you haven't heard the buzz, the scoop, the word on the street, I'm getting evicted. Tomorrow. So pardon me if I'm not in a holly-jolly mood right now.
SIMON	Ronna, they wouldn't evict you at Christmas. You'd be ho-ho-homeless.
SIMON	Is that why all the overtime? How much do you owe?
RONNA	Three eighty.
SIMON	That's nothing.
RONNA	More than I got.
SIMON	I'll give you twenty right now for a blowjob.
SIMON	Handjob?
SIMON	Ronna, do you want my shift?
RONNA	Serious? * CONTINUED: 6B
SIMON	I haven't punched in yet. * She only half-believes him. Simon's not prone to benevolence.
SIMON [CONT'D]	Look, my best mates are going to Las Vegas * this weekend. I've never been -- I'm told it's incredible. If you took my shift, I could go with them. Everybody wins. Cash up front.
RONNA	Deal.
SIMON	Ronna? Are you certain I couldn't have a blowjob?
VOICE ON INTERCOM *	Available cashier to the front. * VOICE ON INTERCOM * Repeat, cashier to the front. * All eyes look up to the voice of God.
CLAIRE	One of us has to go.
MANNIE *	Dead celebrities? * RONNA * Loser goes up. Steve McQueen. * She rips open a case of Snapple, taking one. *
CLAIRE	M...M...
CLAIRE	Michael Landon.
MANNIE	Lucille Ball. CONTINUED: 9
RONNA	Burt Lancaster. Can you drive?
CLAIRE	L...L...
MANNIE	If you don't mind The Beast.
RONNA	I love The Beast.
CLAIRE	Lane Staley. Alice in Chains.
RONNA	He's not dead yet.
MANNIE	It's true.
CLAIRE	Lewis Carroll. Alice in Wonderland.
MANNIE	Carole Lombard.
RONNA	Lee Marvin.
CLAIRE	M...M...
MANNIE	Don't say Molly Ringwald.
CLAIRE	Martha Raye.
MANNIE	Nice. Robert Mitchum.
RONNA	Shit! M. M. MMMMMMMMalcolm X.
CLAIRE	You can't say Malcolm X.
RONNA	He's famous, he's dead.
MANNIE	That's like a rule or something. Nothing starts with X.
RONNA	That's not my problem.
MANNIE	You can challenge.
CLAIRE	Okay, I challenge. Give me one dead celebrity that starts with X.
RONNA	This is bullshit. I am not working the * fucking register.
RONNA	X...X...There is one. I know I thought of one before.
SWITTERMAN	Break was over four minutes ago. Who's up front?
RONNA	I am.
MANNIE	Xerxes.
RONNA	What?
MANNIE	Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with X.
RONNA	That wasn't it. I never heard of fucking "Xerxes."
MANNIE	Pharaoh coulda saved your ass.
VOICE (O.S.)	There's an opera about him.
ADAM	Xerxes. I took music appreciation twice.
ADAM	Does a British guy still work here?
RONNA	He went to Vegas for the weekend. CONTINUED: 10
ADAM	Betcha wonder why we're buying all this orange juice.
RONNA	Scurvy?
ZACK	Say... Ronna. You don't know where we could get something to go with this orange juice, do you?
RONNA	Doughnuts, aisle four.
ZACK	But then you get the weird taste in your mouth. I was thinking something a little more euphoric. The British guy usually hooks us up.
RONNA	How much?
ZACK	Twenty at twenty.
RONNA	You're overpaying.
ZACK	We're desperate. A bunch of us are going to this party tonight, this warehouse thing...
RONNA	Mary Xmas Supafest.
ADAM	You're going?
ZACK	And we had planned this kinda pre-party. Only there's 20 of us, it's like all or nothing.
ZACK	A friend was supposed to get the stuff in Chicago, but now he's snowed in. So if you could help us out here...
RONNA	Gimme a number. Let me see what I can do.
ZACK	Kick ass.
RONNA	So do you want the o.j. or not?
ADAM	Absolutely.
CLAIRE	You know that Simon's in Vegas.
RONNA	I don't need Simon. I'm going to Todd.
MANNIE	Todd GAINES?
CLAIRE	Who's Todd Gaines?
MANNIE	Simon's dealer.
CLAIRE	You can't do that, can you? I mean, go around Simon.
RONNA	Ok, listen up. If Simon were here -- which he's not -- he would charge fifteen, when I know he gets it for ten. CONTINUED: 11 Times twenty hits, that's a hundred bucks I'd be pissing out my dick.
MANNIE	But it's like an evolutionary leap. You're moving up the drug food chain. Without permission.
CLAIRE	Ronna, you shouldn't do this.
RONNA	Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back and watch. Besides, Todd likes me. This won't be any problem.
INTERCOM VOICE	Speak!
RONNA	Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me through Simon.
INTERCOM VOICE	Yeah?
RONNA	Can I come up?
RONNA	Todd?
GAINES (O.S.)	Don't let the cat out.
RONNA	I didn't wake you up, did I?
GAINES	Nah.
GAINES	I thought you were still buying quarters off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are quarters.
RONNA	I keep him honest.
GAINES	At that level you're supposed to pinch. It's the economics of it. CONTINUED: 14
GAINES	You leaving?
GAINES	Be good.
GAINES	I take it this is not a social call.
RONNA	I need a favor.
GAINES	A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such good friends, Ronna. Because if we were, you would know I give head before I give favors. I don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim. You might try just telling me what you want to buy.
RONNA	Twenty hits of ecstacy. Out of the green, into the red. The MUSIC is deafening.
GAINES	You come here out of the blue asking for twenty hits. Just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell becomes trafficking.
RONNA	Todd, I would never fuck you like that.
GAINES	How would you fuck me? Would you strap it on?
GAINES	What's the occasion?
RONNA	There's this big Christmas party thing. Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are doing sort of a pre-party thing.
GAINES	Friends of yours. You're not going to go and try to sell this on me, are you?
RONNA	No.
GAINES	You're not dealing.
RONNA	Swear to God.
GAINES	This is the real thing. Pharmaceutical grade, not that crunchy herbal rave shit. Don't let anyone double dose or you'll be frying eggs off `em in the emergency room. One hit per headbanger.
RONNA	Understood.
GAINES	Twenty at fifteen is 300.
RONNA	Fifteen? I was thinking more like ten.
GAINES	You already did strap it on.
RONNA	It's just that I know you charge Simon ten.
GAINES	Inflation's a bitch.
RONNA	Here's the deal. There's 20 of us. I need all of this. But I only have two hundred. I mean, that's all I have.
RONNA (CONT'D)	No, hear me out. This two-hundred is like a downpayment. You give me the stuff, I get the extra hundred from them, then I come right back and pay you.
GAINES	See, that would be doing you a favor, and you know how I feel about favors.
RONNA	I could leave something with you. Collateral.
GAINES	I already got a fucking Swatch. I need something I know you'll come back for.
RONNA	Claire, could you come up with me for a sec?
RONNA	Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just have to sit there.
CLAIRE	Hello! He's a drug dealer.
RONNA	Jesus, Claire. Don't get 818 on me here. How much shit have I done for you? This is nothing.
CLAIRE	No. No! You're making me an accessory.
RONNA	Claire. That bracelet of mine you're wearing is an accessory. You are just some chick who's sitting in an apartment. That's it.
RONNA	Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don't get this money, I get evicted. My ass is out the street.
CLAIRE	You could... CONTINUED: 16
RONNA	No, Claire. I don't have anyone else to go to. I am coming to you and I am asking for your help. Please. Help me.
CLAIRE	Forty-five minutes. That's like eight o'clock.
RONNA	We'll be back by eight, I promise. Is this it? Are you sure?
MANNIE	Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for directions.
MANNIE	Ronna!
MANNIE	You're a pro.
RONNA	I'm a top-seeded amateur. CONTINUED: 17
MANNIE	And I'm a very happy man.
BURKE	Damn good to meet you, Rhonda.
RONNA	Ronna.
BURKE	Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in, I thought we were fucked for sure. Glad we found you.
BURKE	Work work work. Friday must be a busy night.
RONNA	That was just a friend. Hey. What can I get you to drink?
RONNA	Some of that orange juice would be great.
ZACK	So this party tonight sounds like it's gonna be huge. CONTINUED: 18
ADAM	Massive.
ZACK	That would be a synonym for huge.
ADAM	Just backing you up.
ZACK	And I appreciate that.
BURKE (O.S.)	Ronna hun, we are fresh out of o.j...
BURKE	Cerveza?
ADAM	Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of orange juice. It's in the car.
BURKE	Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that right?
RONNA	You got a bathroom?
ADAM	Down the hall on the right.
ZACK	Let me show you...
BURKE	Maybe we could do this first.
ADAM	We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia.
ADAM [FILTERED]	Maybe she didn't notice. Just wait here. Keep it calm. She checks the window. Nailed shut.
RONNA	You're fine. You're fine. Hesitating, until...
BURKE	Everything all right in there?
RONNA	Fine. Child safety. CONTINUED: 23 A few pills scatter on the carpet. She dumps the contents into the toilet.
RONNA	All yours.
BURKE	Ronna, hun, do we got a deal here or not?
RONNA	No. No, see we don't. That's what I came here to tell you. I couldn't get anything. CONTINUED: 27
BURKE	C'mon, resourceful girl like you? I don't believe it.
RONNA	It's true.
BURKE	I just want to make a deal here, Ronna. Can we make a deal?
RONNA	Who the fuck are you? Monty Hall?
RONNA	Did you know I'm only 17?
RONNA (FILTERED)	I probably shouldn't be drinking this beer, should I? Being so underage and all.
LOOP	Man, I don't know what happened, it's like the machine just ate the tape. CONTINUED: 28 Why would they go after you?
RONNA	I think it was Simon they were after. He deals all the time out of the store. I mean, he makes change out of the fucking register.
MANNIE	They didn't know who was dealing, just that it was someone at the store?
RONNA	They were fishing. I bit.
RONNA	It's Claire. She paged me while I was in there.
MANNIE	We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't show up, whatever. And then just swap the pills for Claire.
RONNA	We can't.
MANNIE	Why not?
RONNA	They're gone. I flushed them.
MANNIE	Oh shit.
RONNA	Think of something. I need a hundred bucks or 20 hits of X. CONTINUED: 29 What?!
RONNA	You took one, didn't you? Fuck you, Mannie! How could you do this to me? I need you now.
RONNA	Drive.
MANNIE	Where?
RONNA	Just drive. I have an idea.
A CRAPPY CD PLAYER	spins away. He presses the "| " button, then cranks the volume dial all the way up.

Stop fucking paging me, Claire!	Mannie nurses the Evian bottle. with you?...Yeah...The Crazy Horse, you'll have to look it up...I don't know what I'm up to. Claire is sitting in the corner, holding herself very still. chick...Like her name is Mary, not like you marry her. You fucking moron...I dunno, some warehouse shit. CLAIRE
Yeah, I guess.	GAINES be a kick-ass-fucking-time...What, you know her? CLAIRE
I know.	GAINES
She knows...Hell, I dunno...	boy...Whatever. He hangs up. The CD player is still muted. The silence is
What do you want for Christmas, Claire?	CLAIRE
I don't know.	GAINES
Do you want to get laid?	CLAIRE
No.	GAINES
No, you don't wanna get laid or no, you	do, but you don't want to get laid with me? CLAIRE
You can't answer that. I mean, it's	like... GAINES
Either way you're fucked. Where are they,	Claire? CLAIRE
They'll be here.	GAINES
They'll be here. Huh.	He gestures like he's going to click on the CD player, but
Are you a virgin?	CLAIRE
What?	GAINES
C'mon, Claire. Answer the question.	Answer the question, Claire. She doesn't say anything. Gaines laughs his ass off.
Breakfast Club. I get it.	GAINES
Look at me. I want to show you something.	She looks back over at him. He slowly undoes the drawstring to

I'm not kidding. Where the fuck are they,	Claire? The gun pointed at her, Claire is losing her shit. Her face
Speak!	FILTERED VOICE
It's Ronna!	Smiling, Gaines hits the DOOR button. Claire collects her
Don't say anything. And try not to look	so stoned. He nods, wiping a finger across his forehead to squeegee off
That's no problem. These things happen, I	understand that. Claire smiles, relieved. Mannie stands behind Ronna, his gaze and I'll have the manager give you a refund. RONNA
Todd, I'm trying to explain what	happened. They had already gotten stuff from somewhere else. It was just a case of miscommunication, I thought... Ronna's VOICE fades to nothing as we PUSH IN on Mannie.
I can hear your thoughts.	Mannie squints, looks around. He and the cat are alone in the

No. "C"	Chiang Kai-Shek. The cat curls itself.

That's fine. Todd, I'm really sorry about	all this. Ronna steers Mannie towards the door, trying to keep his back
Hey Ronna.	A beat. Todd shakes the pill bottle.
I just gave you a favor.	RONNA They trade a look as she exits. Gaines picks up the cat, gives Hands waving, Claire struggles to keep herself from laughing
Pin me.	She leans down to let Claire pin the holly in a crown around
Okay, at the risk of sounding like. You	know. Me. What are you going to do about getting evicted? You're still short, aren't you? Mannie's hand flops down to the window. Claire hands him the
What? What?	
Hi. I'm Kelly, and this is Donna. We	were wondering if you might want to hang out.
I think I feel something.	RONNA
It's really smooth, isn't it? Donna's	brother is a pharmacist. He got it for us. A look from Claire -- why are dragging me into this? But she

Is it really that cool?	FILA GUY
You gotta try it. Shit, I'll buy for you.	He pulls out his wallet and hands Ronna a twenty. She gives

We're out of that. We're down to chewable	aspirin. A SKATE-PUNK GUY comes up to them, money in hand.
Hey. People are saying you have some	really good stuff. Ronna takes the money, looks him over.
Show me your tits.	A beat. He pulls up his shirt to show his skinny white chest.
How much have you made?	RONNA
Four hundred.	The opening RUMBLES of an industrial ANTHEM rise as we cut to: Stops. Pulls open a drawer full of socks. Shakes out a pill. Flicks on a desk lamp. Fuck. The invite Claire gave him. With a sudden RAGE, he WINGS the plate against the far wall.

Best twenty bucks you could spend.	We look past Fila Guy to see Todd Gaines, who's been listening. Mannie fights his way through the outer ring of MOSHERS... Through the crowd, we see Gaines looking in... He YELLS in her ear. He has to repeat himself... She sees Gaines. He sees her. BOUNCER The Bouncer is blindsided by Gaines, who charges after Ronna.
What's wrong? Mannie?	She puts a hand on his sweating forehead. His cheeks.
Jesus. You're burning up.	MANNIE
I can't feel my hands.	RONNA
Listen to me. We're going to find Claire	and get out of here.
Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave	you here. I'm going to get the car and come back for you. She fishes the keys out of his pocket. Mannie grabs onto her RONNA
I can't carry you! Mannie, just hide	here. Just like a little mouse, okay? You're going to be fine. Ain't nobody leaving. She pushes his legs into the shadows. He's crying.
How's it going, Ronna? How are sales?	Her heart skips a beat. She drops the keys.
Todd, I can explain.	GAINES
I'm not going to ask you to.	He climbs off the car, approaching.
The thing is, it's not like I'm in a	highly ethical industry. But goddamn, Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy hits. He pulls his gun from the back of his jeans. By instinct, she
It's not what it looks like. I mean, it	sort of is, but it's complicated. GAINES
Not really.	He cocks the gun. RONNA
I know I fucked up, but I can make it up	to you. Please, Todd. GAINES
I'm the last fucking person you should be	expecting a favor from. RONNA
I have the cash. I have more than I owe	you. GAINES
So now you're an entrepreneur.	At the last moment, Ronna bolts. She ducks around the corner
"GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)	
Mannie!!	There's no answer. The YELLING hurts. She won't do that
Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the	fuck it was! Perry Farrell's dead girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A. Fuck, I knew there was one. A sudden spasm of pain. She winces, sobbing. It passes.

Mo'fuckin Jack-in-the-box.	TINY (19) is not black, but thinks he is.
Dude, you passed out before we left L.A.	MARCUS (24) was a tailback at UCLA, and still has the build.
Pop! Goes the asshole.	
So this chick, she's bobbing up and down	on my dick like she's fucking Marilyn Chambers. SINGH
She actually found your dick?	TINY you know, painting the tree--when WHACK! It hits her in the eye. And her contact, it's like stuck on my dick. The passengers don't seem impressed.
Her contact lens. It's stuck on the end	of my dick. MARCUS
Was it hard or soft?	TINY
What, my dick?	SINGH
The contact lens.	MARCUS
Do you remember if it was a colored lens?	That she used to have two blue eyes and now she had one blue and one brown? TINY
What the fuck does that matter?	MARCUS was my story. I told this story about a year ago. The difference was, I knew those small-but-important details. That, and it was true. TINY
Oh. Whatever.	MARCUS
Whatever?	TINY
Whatever.	A beat. And another. The matter just won't drop.
Yo, pull your stinky dinky out of my ass.	I was just trying to make conversation. Fuck. Give a nigger a break. Singh MOANS, not again.
What nigger? This nigger?	TINY
My mother's mother's mother was black.	MARCUS
So you say, yet we have never seen a	picture of this Ebonic woman. SINGH
Stop. Truce.	MARCUS
If you were any less black, you would be	clear. SIMON MARCUS
Look at your skin.	TINY
I see black because I know I am. Color is	a state of mind. MARCUS
Thank you Rhythm Nation.	
So what does Valentina do?	MARCUS
She's a nutritionist. She also teaches a	class at this college. SIMON
What class?	MARCUS
Tantric sexuality for couples.	SINGH
She teaches people how to fuck?	TINY
Man, I taught myself.	MARCUS with iodine. TINY
This shit is expensive. You're paying	five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit. Tiny up-ends the rest of the shrimp cocktail onto his plate.
Thing is, most people really don't know	how to make love. They just put it in and move it around until they get off. What tantra teaches you is how to prolong and deepen the experience, bring it to a higher level. If one man in ten were having the sex I'm having, there would be no war. SIMON it? MARCUS
Fourteen hours.	SINGH
Holy shit!	TINY
How many times you shoot?	MARCUS
Not once.	SIMON
Fourteen hours, you didn't go once. Not	even at the end? MARCUS
You redirect the orgasm inside.	He's greeted with skeptical looks.
How long does your orgasm last? A couple	seconds? I've had orgasms that lasted an hour and a half. SIMON
Bullshit.	MARCUS
Swear to God. And I do mean Allah.	SINGH
When was the last time you got off? I	mean like, wet. MARCUS
I haven't ejaculated in six months.	TINY
Six months!	MARCUS
Anyone can do it. All it takes is	discipline. TINY
You are some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi	motherfucker. with coming and going. Am I right? Singh agrees. Simon, however, is still intrigued. SIMON
He gets a discount. He let me use it.	He's a good guy. MARCUS
He's the good drug dealer. I get	confused. SIMON
We'll pay cash anyway. This is just to	get the room. The Desk Woman returns with their keys.
Could you answer a question...	man could make love to a woman for 14 hours without ever achieving climax? DESK WOMAN
I think my manager would be better able to	answer that question. Would you like me to call him over? SIMON
No. Not necessary.	DESK WOMAN
Great then. Welcome to the Riviera.	Simon walks away with Marcus.
Did I tell you not to eat the shrimp?	SINGH
I have something for you. Where did I put	it? Oh, it's right here. He gives him the finger. Simon is on the phone by the window. Vegas, we just got here. What was the name of the place you said we should go...The Crazy Horse. What are you doing tonight? Marcus neatly unfolds his clothes, hanging them up in the rave? From the wall, KNOCKING. Simon and Marcus look to a door by her? Simon points at the KNOCKING door. Marcus finally opens it to
Who are you?	MARCUS
This is our room.	Simon leans around to look. BOY SIMON
Raping small children.	The Boy's MOTHER yanks him back from the door, shutting it.
Did I mention how much I like your jacket?	MARCUS
No.	SIMON
There's a reason.	The elevator bell BINGS.
Let me borrow some money.	MARCUS
Where's your money?	SIMON
I lost it	The DEALER is waiting for Marcus to play. He takes a card,
We've been here five minutes.	SIMON
I was playing this game at a hundred	dollar table and I didn't understand it, but now I do. I think I figured out how to beat it. MARCUS
Let me see your wallet.	Simon hands it over. Marcus pockets it.
You can have it back in an hour. No, no.	No buts. One hour, right here.
Okay, if you're from over there, then	where did you meet these friends? Of yours. Who I don't see. SIMON
They already knew each utter, but Marcus I	met in traffic school. His accent is suddenly Irish. It's weirdly charming. SIMON
I'm a good driver, I am. I learned	everything from American television. Hunter, Magnum P.I. -- The Knight Rider is an excellent program. The doors open at the Beckys' floor. They get off. Rebecca
Do you want to be getting high with us?	Simon hands her the pipe and the lighter.
Oh my God!	Her kleenex is on fire, flames in each nostril. Hands waving,
You're fine. You're fine.	Becky is crying. SIMON
You're beautiful.	He kisses her. After a moment, her panic subsides. She kisses BECKY He shakes his head.
Why not?	SIMON
Tantra, baby.	LATER A beat before Marcus sees the bill and makes the connection.
I am not a bathroom attendant!	
Hey. We're leaving.	MARCUS
Fuck yeah.	
Keep it close and there's an extra ten	bucks for you. He slips Marcus a five as he rushes into the casino. A beat.
Get in. Get in the car. Get in.	hold it in at the end, right? MARCUS
No. Never. Redirect the energy, but you	never hold it in. Haven't you ever gotten blue balls? Hurts like a bitch. SIMON MARCUS
Exactly.	Marcus looks over to Simon, who is trying to get his breath.
See if there's a map.	Simon goes through the glove compartment. Amid the condoms and
Orange County.	He throws it out. He tries to shut the compartment, but it's
Holy shit.	Marcus looks over. Simon gently pulls out a 9mm Baretta.
Don't point it at me!	SIMON
How do I know if it's loaded?	MARCUS
First, you stop pointing it at me.	Simon aims the other way, out the window. As they drive
Floor. Floor!	Simon throws the gun to the floor. Marcus flinches, expecting
I've never held a real gun before. It's	heavier than I thought. MARCUS
Great, put it back.	SIMON
I want to know if it's loaded. How do	I... He starts pulling and pushing on it, trying to get the clip
Hold the wheel.	Marcus removes the clip, hands it over. Simon counts the
I hold ten men's lives in my hand.	MARCUS
It's a nine millimeter. It doesn't have	stopping power. SIMON

I'm kicking your ass if you knock again.	Tiny goes back into the other room, pulling the door shut.
Fuck you.	
Listen up. They're going to ask if you	want buy a bottle of champagne. You don't, but don't say that right off. SIMON
Explain.	MARCUS
Champagne means you want a private dance.	You can't afford it, neither can I. But if they know we're not biting, they don't even dangle the bait. SIMON
So, "champagne" is a code.	MARCUS
Nothing.	At the door, Marcus stops Simon before he goes in.
We have one word, champagne. You can	order anything you want, anything, as long as it's not champagne.

What the fuck did I tell you!	He kicks Simon in the ass.
Yo. Yo! He fucked up, he lost control.	VIC JR.
Am I talking to you? I'm talking to your	faggot friend here. He kicks Simon again. Holly and Noelle stand in the corner.
We're leaving.	
Enough! Stop kicking him.	Vic Jr. turns on Marcus. A beat. He shoves him, hard.
I'm not trying to throw down here.	VIC JR. MARCUS
I don't want to try.	Vic Jr. WHACKS Marcus, an old-fashioned bitch slap. A beat.
Everybody back the fuck away.	They do. Marcus holds his place.
Oh, man. Fuck.	Blood is squirting out of Vic Jr.'s arm. He holds it, HOLLY
Behind you.	A fire escape door. Simon motions for Marcus to come. Pushing

It's probably Orange County asking where	the hell his car is. SIMON

VICTOR [CONT'd] (cont'd) being so fucking incompetent that the guy ahead of you can't even do his job, he falls on his ass and congratulations, you're on top. Only now the top is down here when it used to be up here and you don't even know the difference. He finishes the last stitch, tying it off.
My generation, we're dinosaurs. We're	gonna die. You're gonna kill us off. But you'll never be dinosaurs. You're little fucking rats and that's all you're ever going to be. Holly looks in, holding a gold card. Victor motions, "well?"

Fuck Mexico. We're going home. To L.A.	SINGH
Simon, think about it. If they were going	to call the cops, they would have called them in Las Vegas. They just wanted us gone, and we're gone. It's over. Simon checks the mirror, checks the road. With a deep breath, credit card for me. You ready? He takes the gold card from his pocket.

Hey! People in here!	Whoever was trying to come in gives up. Burke pulls a college
Just so we're clear. Whether you get	something on this guy or not, Adam and I are done today. Finished. Charges dropped. That's how it works, right? Burke smiles, an amused roll of the eyes.
What?	BURKE
Seems to me, if a guy's so concerned about	the legal process, how come he finds himself getting busted for possession? Adam and Zack share a look. A beat.
Relax. I sign your form and the whole	thing goes away. Your lawyer got you a good deal. Loop sits back, his job finished.

Safe enough.	A BEEP as he presses a button. His headphones register.

She doesn't do anything.	BURKE
They're not even married and she does	nothing. My wife -- we've been married two years -- she still takes overtime three nights a week. Loop bows to Burke's superiority.
My wife's a deputy sherriff, you believe	that? A cop and a sherriff, married. It's like the freakin' odd couple.
I smell a pilot.	Burke is oblivious to sarcasm. Loop's pita is self-
You guys got girlfriends?	What am I saying? You gotta lot of girlfriends don't you? You got women sending you their panties. Two good- looking guys... LOOP BURKE

Man, I'm sorry. How did you find out?	ON ADAM, corner of his eye.
It's no big...I don't really want to get	into it. LOOP

Absolutely. Tell us.	There's a palpable tension between Adam and Zack. The others
I found socks.	BURKE
What, red socks, blue socks?	ZACK
White socks. You know how the good kind	of socks have band around the ankle that keeps them from stretching out? When I moved in, every one of the socks had that. Suddenly, there was one sock that didn't. BURKE
You hear that? We got John Sherlock	Holmes in the car here. We pull into the parking lot of ADAM
Alright. But you've been fucking around,	too. ZACK
Only after I found out.	ADAM
Huh.	
So, Zack. Do you know who your	girlfriend's fucking? He over-articulates, as if speaking for a Learn English Now!
No, Adam. I do not. I have suspicions.	Mostly former boyfriends who keep calling. ADAM
What a coincidence. I have the exact same	problem with my girlfriend. In fact, I think she's been sleeping around on me, too. ZACK

So, sooner or later, everybody's working	for The Man. BURKE
Exactly.	Adam motions to leave it alone. Zack won't. Burke cracks his neck, showtime.
What if she isn't really a dealer though?	If you just pulled her into this one thing, wouldn't that be entrapment? BURKE
If she's making this deal, she's a dealer.	Doesn't matter if its her first or her last. We stay on Zack, unconvinced.
Cerveza?	He hands Ronna the beer. orange juice. It's in the car. Ronna has halfway figured out what's going on.
Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is	that right? RONNA ADAM
Down the hall on the right.	ZACK
Let me show you...	SLOW MOTION
Go.	Ronna sees it. Her eyes go wider. Zack nods. In the background, Burke is trying to look around. Ronna twist it away while I put on the second cuff. That way he can't go after me. He doesn't have any leverage. He releases his hold on Zack, his hands cuffed behind him.
I watch all these cop shows and they never	do it right. Pisses me off. Loop emerges from the back room, carrying a big box of
Hey, feel the abs on this one.	He rubs Zack's stomach.
You could scrub laundry on these.	LOOP Loop pauses at the door, looking around. He's forgotten
What?	A beat. Loop can't remember what it was.
Nothing. I'm out of it. Merry Christmas,	guys. Good to meet you. Adam waves. Zack nods. Loop shuts the door behind himself.
We're done, now, right? That's what we	talked about. Whether or not the deal went through, we just had to do our part.
You did your part.	ZACK He turns to the side, offering Burke his handcuffs to undo.
Now that he's gone, there's something I	wanted to ask you guys about. Sort of a proposition. -- we're both working on Christmas so we're gonna have Christmas dinner tonight.

Yes? Hi?	ADAM
Sorry. Phone. Messages. Check?	IRENE
Here.	She points. He sheepishly crosses to get it. While he's family. Minnesota, they do that. She leans close to listen. Smiles. She continues to lean
Sorry.	BURKE
No, stay for a sec.	Burke sprays more cologne on his hand.
Smell this. What does it smell like?	Zack shakes his head, doesn't know.
CK One. But it's not.	ZACK
Really.	BURKE
I get this for a quarter what that stuff	costs. ZACK
It's nice.	BURKE
Here.	He sprays some on Zack's hands, who didn't want it. While ZACK
It is soft.	BURKE
Get on.	ZACK
That's okay.	Burke pushes Zack back flat the bed.
Did you hear that?	ZACK
Hear what?	BURKE
Exactly. Individually wrapped springs.	Top quality. Burke climbs onto the bed beside him.
I could be doing aerobics over here and	you wouldn't feel it. ZACK
I sure wouldn't.	A beat.
So, Zack. Would you say you're open to	new things?
Of course you like your job. You get to	kiss all those pretty girls. ADAM Irene pops the beaters out of the mixer, hands one to Adam.
Tell me something. When you kiss those	girls, you're not really kissing them, are you? ADAM
It's a stage kiss. Your lips touch, but	there's no tongue. IRENE
There's no feeling. Nobody gets jealous.	ADAM
It's acting. It's not real.	She takes his cleaned beater from him, dumps it in the sink.
See, now, that. There was a tongue there.	BURKE (O.S.)
Honey, red or white?	Now dressed, Burke comes in with two bottles of wine. Zack is
What goes with turkey?	ADAM AND ZACK
White.	
More wine?	ZACK
No. He doesn't want any more. Unless he	does, do you? ADAM
No.	ZACK

If you gotta go, then I understand.	motive inviting you here. Zack looks to Adam.
He makes it sound sinister. It's not.	BURKE
She's right. Okay, you've looked around	our place. Where do you think we got most of this stuff? Adam and Zack shake their heads.
Just guess.	ADAM

We're the number four distributor in	Southern California. By March, we might be number three. She crosses her fingers. So does Burke. We look to Zack,
Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene	and I can't recruit distributors from inside the force. It's against the rules and we'd get fired. So what we do is look for people in other industries... IRENE
...like the entertainment industry.	ZACK
Wait.	BURKE
Confederated Products. It's a different	company, different quality of product.
I need to do something terrifically	unwholesome. I need to bathe in sin. ADAM
With me, or one of your other boyfriends?	
I have cheated on you with exactly one	guy. ADAM
Ditto.	ZACK

No. See, if I tell you, you will freak	out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it. He finds the right brand.
I'll tell you mine.	ADAM
No.	ZACK
Why not?	ADAM
You can't wait to tell me, can you?	You're gloating. You think yours is better than mine. ZACK
I don't.	ADAM
It's Sean Connery, isn't it?	ZACK
Count of three.	ADAM
Alright. Sure. Wait.	With fingers, they both count off "One. Two. Three." Jimmy. Jimmy in makeup. ADAM
Jimmy?	ZACK
Jimmy. Jimmy.	They both stand for a moment, bewildered. It's their turn at
Is Jimmy here?	SANDRA
Oh my God. Oh. My God.	She's thrilled and disbelieving at the same time. She fishes Let me find it. She can't decide whether to close the door on them or not, so
You do know, don't you?	ZACK
We know.	SANDRA
I take no responsibilty. I was only an	innocent bystander. But there was once where you missed each other by three minutes. It was so exciting. She finds what she was looking for on the back of the door.
It's some sort of rave thing.	ZACK SANDRA
He left an hour ago.	Adam and Zack head back down the hall. She calls out after
You're not going to kill him, are you?	The little shit owes me rent.
Okay, I just have to say this. The thing	is, about Jimmy, he wasn't even that good. ADAM ZACK
Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made,	God. It was like having sex with Nell. Adam imitates the MOAN.
Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales	were beaching themselves. ADAM
And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips.	That's really not necessary. ZACK
The only thing I will give him credit for	is the oral. ADAM
What do you mean? He was terrible. At	some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up. A beat.
When was that?	ADAM
October, maybe?	ZACK
Early October. And he suddenly got so	much better. A beat.
That is so disturbing. It's like you were	there. A sloe-eyed blonde boy (JIMMY) makes friendly with the
Right. This right. This right!	Adam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way. A beat
What the fuck!	Ronna's face suddenly slams down on the windshield, bleeding
Oh my God.	ADAM
It's...It's that girl.	ZACK
Ronna.	Her body continues its slide across the windshield, finally
Go. Go. Go!	ADAM
What if she's...	ZACK
Go!	Adam pops the clutch and they lurch backward, out of there. ZACK
Let's think about it logically. Either	she's alive, or she's dead. If she's dead, then there's nothing we can do. If she's alive, then the guy with the gun, who seemed to want to shoot her, probably did shoot her. ADAM
So even if she's alive, she's dead.	ZACK
Exactly.	Adam takes another drink.
On the plus side, the only witnesses are	you, me and him. And none of us are going to want to be talking about it. So if you really think about it, it didn't turn out as badly as it could have. ADAM
A girl is dead.	ZACK Adam gets out of the car, walks away. Zack takes another swig.

Holy sh...	He stops himself. Adam throws the bundle as far as he can.

There's a pretty good chance no one's	found her yet. ADAM
They will.	ZACK
No. Listen. If there's no body, there's	no crime.
Stop. Okay, stop!	ADAM
What?	ZACK
It's a Miata.	All Adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. Maybe.
We'll put her in the passenger seat.	ADAM
Where will I...Or you...	ZACK
In the passenger seat. Holding her up.	Adam shudders at the thought.
Little help?	ADAM ZACK
What do you mean?	ADAM
I can't do this.	Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do
Okay, listen to me...	ADAM
She's dead.	ZACK
She's not dead.	ADAM
She's dead. I hit her and I killed her.	He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them.
No you didn't, okay? This is all just	make-believe. This is a scene. She's just acting dead. And you're just acting scared. Adam laughs to himself, still crying.
See, there's the lights, and there's the	camera. Watch your blocking. Michelle!" ADAM
Hi, Michelle.	ZACK
The craft service truck is right around	the corner, and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill. And you can have one if you just help me finish this scene. the grill? A beat.
I'm not delusional.	
Then take her fucking arms!	Obeying, Adam grabs Ronna's wrists as Zack pushes from below.
She's not dead.	ZACK
No shit!	They stand back, watching Ronna MOAN as she lies half-in, half-
If she's not dead, that means we didn't	kill her. We can just leave her. ZACK
She's almost dead. We leave her and she	dies, why did we bother coming back? I mean, you still killed her. ADAM
What do you mean, I killed her?	ZACK
Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon.	I would never testify against you. Adam is not reassured.
We have to stick with Plan A.	ADAM
In Plan A she was dead.	Zack reaches into the car, pulling out The Club. Trades a look
Okay. New plan.	
Back away from the vehicle.	Weaving through some parked cars, we settle on an angry BMW,
Hey, it's Kelly. Somebody beat the crap	out of her. Moving to find...
Somebody call an ambulance!	After a beat, he realizes he should do it himself. He takes

What about that guy? The guy with the	gun. He could still go after her. ZACK
Okay, listen. Girl in ditch -- that's our	problem. Girl out of ditch -- that's her own problem. We're done. We did the right thing. Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Off Adam's look...
Okay, approximately the right thing. In a	half-assed, thrown-together fashion. Adam smiles despite himself. Zack points, "See? See?" That

Alright. Mistakes were made. Things	didn't go exactly as planned. Claire's eyes -- understatement.

No, I got a ride. His car was still in	the parking lot when I left. RONNA

Only, one just got back from two weeks at sea -- Sal Dominico's boat. It got me thinkin' -- if Chase really did know Carmen was on to him, how come he didn't tell Lucas, or Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by himself? And why would you still have his briefcase? an answer. MUSIC rises, a scene cut.
