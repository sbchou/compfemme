CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
NEEDY V.O.	Every day, I get letters. I think I get more letters than Santa Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil combined. I'm kind of the shit.
RAYMUNDO	Rec time in five minutes, Needy.
NEEDY	Grassy-ass, Raymundo.
NEEDY V.O.	Sometimes the letters are from people who say they're praying for me. They tell me everything will be okay if I just accept Jesus Christ into my heart. I say the words, but nothing ever happens. Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off the cross.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	Occasionally I get presents from starfuckers who saw my picture in the paper and want to marry me or something. They think they can take me away from all this. CONTINUED: Like I'd really date some perverted Chester with a hard-on for jailbait. I might be insane, but I'm not desperate.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	A lot of people ask me if I'm sorry I did it.
NEEDY	I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
NEEDY V.O.	Welcome to the Mental Olympics. They're big on recreation here. Supposedly it helps us vent our aggressions. We've traded in our hatchets for rackets, our Drain-O bombs for double dutch. CONTINUED: Even the cutters get in on the action when they're fully conscious. Me? I'm just trying to stay invisible. NEEDY V.O. Personally, I think they're trying to wear us out. Keep us sluggish so there won't be an uprising. Well, those J.V. tactics won't work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I- C-K-E-R. It even says so on my chart. A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually
NUTRITIONIST	Just one Toastem, huh? NEEDY I like Toastems.
NUTRITIONIST	That's good. But I'm not sure a Toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day. I'd recommend more complex carbohydrates... CONTINUED: I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP! The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by Needy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her NEEDY V.O. I wasn't always this cracked. I used to be normal-- well, as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones. But after the killings began, I started to feel, I don't know... loose around the edges or something. I was coming undone like those jeans I made in Home Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork. Dead inside. Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES Suddenly, soft music is piped into "the hole," ostensibly CONTINUED:
CHEESY SONG LYRICS	"Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again..."
NEEDY V.O.	God, I hate this fucking song. TITLE: TWO MONTHS EARLIER
NEEDY	This is where it all went down. "Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I know, but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall. NEEDY V.O. Well technically, it's two waterfalls. One of them is normal-- it empties into a river basin. But the other one goes into a hole. And it doesn't come out. The scientist guys can't explain it. They've dropped all kinds of things down there--bouncy balls, red dye, radioactive slime-- but nothing ever surfaces. CONTINUED: Maybe it's another dimension. Or, you know, just really deep. There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the
NEEDY V.O.	I've probably spent years of my life in this house. Hundreds of sleepovers, thousands of aimless homework sessions, a million phone calls. I've climbed through Jennifer's window so many times. But tonight, only one of us is going to come out. Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH NEEDY V.O. Jennifer didn't always look this rough. Actually, she was the prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle when she wasn't so...hungry.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	She hadn't fed in weeks. CONTINUED: Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched JENNIFER Huh? Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES
NEEDY	You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh? You killed Chip! You goddamned monster! You...ZOMBITCH! JENNIFER Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot? God, you're butch. NEEDY Know what this is for? Cutting boxes. She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right CROSS OUT JENNIFER! Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and
JENNIFER	My tit! Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT, MRS. CHECK Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my God! Oh my God! She pulls Needy off her daughter. Jennifer rolls over, Needy? Needy drops the boxcutter. It lands on Jennifer's copy of
NEEDY	Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get her? Mrs. Check SCREAMS. Needy SMILES.
ROMAN	Christ, Needy, what have you done? Officer Duda starts the ignition. His partner, a hard-
NEEDY	Hi, Roman! How's the Force treating you? I like that jaunty cap. Blue like your balls. ROMAN How could you do this, Needy? You killed Jen-- Jennifer-- I mean, the victim. Are you on something?
NEEDY	Everything's going to be okay now. I rule. FEMALE COP Shut your mouth back there! NEEDY Hey. Didn't you used to baby-sit me in like 1998? When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel? The female cop fidgets uncomfortably. CONTINUED:
NEEDY (CONT'D)	Yeah. Gracie, right? Gracie. I really like your hair, Gracie. How many cans of Salon Selectives did it take to erect that monument? The cop reaches into the backseat and SLAPS Needy, who Watch it, Puffy Combs. That's police brutality! FEMALE COP You're one to talk about brutality, Ms. Lesnicki. You're looking at attempted murder.
NEEDY	Ugh, don't say attempted. That sounds so JV. Small time. Teeny- weeny, just like Officer Duda up there. And trust me-- I'd know. Roman swallows nervously, eyes on the road. Officer Let's get our facts straight: I successfully committed a hard core, fully premeditated murder back there. I fucking destroyed that brat, OK? I, Needy Lesnicki, put a stop-payment on Jennifer Check. She slumps down in the backseat. Why am I even in these cuffs? I just saved every guy in this town from becoming Satan Chow. I'm a hero. FEMALE COP She's delirious. ROMAN This is going to be a circus.
FEMALE COP	At least we've already got a confession.
NEEDY	Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace. She giggles maniacally. Roman turns on the radio, violating protocol. It's a
ROMAN	God, I love this song.
FEMALE COP	I know. And they've done so much for this town.
ROMAN	They're way more than a band, really. They're heroes. FEMALE COP Wait, this is my favorite part... Roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the
FEMALE COP AND ROMAN	"Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you, that you are home..." NEEDY V.O. So I killed her. Whatever. It won't undo anything. Three pulses-- three lives-- all stopped cold by adolescent bloodlust. It's hard to believe that just two months ago, me, Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip were completely normal people. We were our yearbook pictures. Nothing more, nothing less.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	Jesus, Chip.. CHIP drums on the sidelines of the Devil's Kettle High NEEDY V.O. Chip couldn't drum for shit. He only knew "Land of a Thousand Dances" and the solo from "Wipeout." Lucky for him, the pep band gig wasn't too demanding. If you can believe it, that's Jennifer. Yeah, the same girl I iced with the box-cutter. Only back then, we were tight. Sisters, practically. People found it hard to believe that a babe like Jennifer would associate with a dork like me. But we'd been the Wonder Twins since we were practically preverbal. Sandbox love never dies. CONTINUED:
CHASTITY	You're totally lesbigay. NEEDY What? She's my best friend. The geeky girl mockingly imitates Needy's excited wave.
CHASTITY	You stare at her like you want to dry hump her. Needy ignores her. Like, hump her through pants. NEEDY Are you jealous?
CHASTITY	Of what? That rich bitch? NEEDY She's not rich. JENNIFER Hey, Monistat. NEEDY What's up, Vagisil? You and me are going out tonight.
NEEDY	Tonight? Why? Soft Shoulder are playing at the Carousel. CONTINUED: And it's all-ages, for once, which means I won't have to play Hello Titty with the door guy.
NEEDY	What's Soft Shoulder?
JENNIFER	They're this indie band from the city. I saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty. And there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you. Come on Needy, it's the weekend! NEEDY It's Thursday.
JENNIFER	Thursday counts as the weekend in college. And we're going to be in college twenty-three months from now. University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo! Needy continues loading her backpack. Please, please you're a social disease? NEEDY I have to study. Jennifer pouts. With an outstretched finger, she draws a
JENNIFER	Boo! Cross out Needy! NEEDY Fine. What time is the show?
JENNIFER	I'll pick you up at 8:30. My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store.
NEEDY	He seems nice.
JENNIFER	Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge... heart. So huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection. Wear something cool, okay? NEEDY Okay. NEEDY V.O. "Wear something cool" meant something very specific in Jennifer-speak. It meant I couldn't look like a nerd, but I couldn't upstage her either. I could expose my stomach, but never cleavage. Tits were her trademark. CHIP DOVE is sitting on the bed, looking lost in all that
CHIP	Those jeans are hella low. I can almost see your front butt. NEEDY Chip, it's a rock show. This is my rock look.
CHIP	I can see, like, your womb. Needy sighs and hoists up her pants. Why are you blowing me off for some dumb concert, anyway? We were supposed to have Movie Night. I even rented Orca. It's like Jaws, except with a harmless whale. CONTINUED:
NEEDY	Jennifer needs me. She really wants to go see this band. It's extremely important to her. CHIP I've never even heard of Soft Shoulder. Which one is Jennifer stalking? NEEDY The lead singer, of course. Girls like her don't go out with drummers.
CHIP	Thanks a lot!
NEEDY	No offense. I mean, she'd probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer. CHIP Like Phil Collins. NEEDY Who's Phil Collins? CHIP Forget it. He's seminal, but whatever...
NEEDY	Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. But Jennifer says he's extra salty, so... CHIP Salty. You guys ever going to stop using that secret language?
NEEDY	"Salty" means beautiful.
CHIP	Then you must be soy sauce, babe. Needy and CHIP start MAKING OUT. CHIP unbuckles his belt
NEEDY	Jennifer's here.
CHIP	How do you know? Needy shrugs. A beat of silence. Then we hear the door
JENNIFER	Needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here!
CHIP	That's fucking weird.
NEEDY	I'd better hurry. CHIP You always do what Jennifer tells you to do. Needy pulls her NECKLACE out from beneath her shirt and
NEEDY	She's my best friend, Chip. Remember? This necklace is no joke. CHIP sighs, resigned. They head downstairs.
JENNIFER	Guess who's got the whip `til 11:30? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and it's all mine.
NEEDY	Wow. CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	You're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style! She does a sexy little dance in the doorway, then notices
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	Oh, hi Chip. Do you like puppies? She grabs her boobs and thrusts her chest outward at him,
CHIP	I think you forgot, like, two buttons.
NEEDY	I think she remembered two buttons. JENNIFER It smells like Thai food in here. Have you guys been fucking?
NEEDY	You're gross! JENNIFER Okay, let's go to the club. The three of them shuffle onto the porch. Needy locks the
CHIP	The Carousel is not a club.
JENNIFER	Eat my ass, Chip. You're just jello `cause you're not invited. CHIP I'm not jello! That place is gross. Everyone there has a mustache.
JENNIFER	You're totally jello! You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it. The girls scamper toward the car.
CHIP	Stop kidnapping my girlfriend! THE CAROUSEL is a run-down tavern at the edge of town, NEEDY V.O. Chip was right. The Carousel is definitely not a club. Clubs are for attractive people in populous urban areas. Clubs have DJs and champagne and separate bathrooms for guys and girls. All we have is a broken jukebox, a few domestic taps and the Sticker Toilet. We see a lone, nasty-looking TOILET covered in BAND BACK ON NEEDY: Needy and Jennifer enter the bar. Every guy in the joint
JENNIFER	God, I can't wait until I'm old enough to get wasted. Have you ever had peach schnapps?
NEEDY	I don't think so. CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Peach schnapps are excellent. They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke. A teenage guy, CRAIG, passes by and waves.
CRAIG	Hi Jennifer. You look nice.
JENNIFER	What up, Craig. She elbows Needy and makes a GAGGING GESTURE. He thinks he's cute enough for me. No wonder he's in retard math. Jennifer pulls out a pack of Camel Wides and lights one NEEDY Hey, it's Ahmet from India. The foreign exchange guy. He's all by himself.
JENNIFER	I can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that. NEEDY He seems okay. He's got that cool elephant statue in his locker. JENNIFER Do you think he's circumcised? I always wanted to try sea cucumber. NEEDY Ew! ROMAN DUDA saunters up to Jennifer, swigging a bottle of
ROMAN	You're smoking dicks now, Jen? JENNIFER What? I like the Wides.
ROMAN	I just bet you do. I should arrest you for possession under the legal age.
JENNIFER	Arrest me, pfft! You're not even out of the academy yet, Roman! ROMAN Two more months and I'm on the force for real. Then I'll be able to cuff you whenever the hell I want. He grips her wrist and twists it behind her back.
JENNIFER	How will I wait that long? She paws Roman's crotch discreetly. Needy winces.
ROMAN	Not here, babe. I gotta keep my nose clean. NEEDY Look, there's the band!
JENNIFER	You can tell they're from the city. ROMAN Yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of faygos.
JENNIFER	You would think that. You're such a small-time Gomer. I wish we had more guys like that in Devil's Kettle. All stylish and shit. Needy nods dumbly. She stares at the band, awestruck.
NEEDY	They look so-- so cool. She gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush JENNIFER Hey, I think they need two groupies. Come on! It'll be like Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl. She grabs Needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag
NEEDY	No!
JENNIFER	Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just boys. Morsels. We have all the power, don't you know that? She plants her hands on Needy's CHEST. These things are like smart bombs. Point `em in the right direction and shit gets real.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	Hi. Um, we just really wanted to meet you or something? I'm Jennifer Check and this is my friend.
NIKOLAI	I'm Nikolai Wolf, and this is my band. He reaches down and pumps Jennifer's outstretched hand.
JENNIFER	Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments. NIKOLAI I hope we can live up to such...high praise.
NEEDY	Hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in Devil's Kettle? You live in the city, right? NIKOLAI Yeah. But I think it's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas. Plus, the audiences in small towns really appreciate us. JENNIFER Can I show you my appreciation right now? Needy looks at the floor, embarrassed. Like, I'll buy you a drink? I mean, I'll see if I can get you a drink. They make this great 9/11 tribute shooter? It's red, white and blue, but you have to drink it fast or it gets all brownish. NIKOLAI Mmm. Jennifer hurries off toward the bar. Nikolai walks up to the guitar player, DIRK, and pulls
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	Dirk, what about her? DIRK Who, Training Bra Jones?
NIKOLAI	No, the hot one. The one who just walked away. She's it, man. She's exactly what we're looking for. DIRK You're sure she's... NIKOLAI She's a kid. We're in God's country, man. Everyone out here's a fundie bible-banger. Of course she's a virgin. Dirk hesitates. Dirk, we didn't haul our asses out to this corn palace for nothing!
DIRK	Fine. Okay. You know, I know I'm not "just the bassist." I'm a person who happens to play the bass guitar. And I would like some respect... Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC
JENNIFER	What? Are you scared of rock stars too?
NEEDY	Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about it.
JENNIFER	I think the singer wants me. NEEDY Only because he thinks you're a virgin. I heard them talking.
JENNIFER	Yeah, right! I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman. By the way, that hurts. I couldn't even go to flags the next day. I had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas. NEEDY Oh my God.
JENNIFER	Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I can do innocent. I'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine. NEEDY He's way too old for you. JENNIFER Don't cock-block me, Needy. NIKOLAI Good evening, Devil's Lake. Someone in the back shouts "Devil's Kettle!" Sorry. Anyway, we're Soft Shoulder. And we just want to make you happy. He WINKS at Jennifer. The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas
NEEDY	I know where to go! Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the
JENNIFER	It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on fire. Oh God, I'm burning!
NEEDY	You're okay, I promise. You got burned worse when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach. Everything's fine. Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both Are you girls all right? CONTINUED:
NEEDY	We're great. Maybe you should try to find your band? NIKOLAI Those guys? They were the first ones out the door. Ran for the van like a bunch of Marys. Frankly, I'm ashamed of them. Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	God, it feels like hell out here. Come and hang with us in the van for a while, just until they hose this place down.
JENNIFER	Okay...okay... She slumps against Nikolai's chest.
NIKOLAI	You're in shock. Here, drink this. You'll feel better. He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS
NEEDY	Aren't you a little freaked out about this? What about all your stuff? It's probably melting, and when you get to the next stop you'll have to do like, a crappy acoustic set! Nobody likes that.
NIKOLAI	We'll be able to afford new gear soon enough. I have a feeling we're gonna blow up.
JENNIFER	I want to see your van. C'mon Needy, let's go to the van. NEEDY Why? Why should we? We have the Malibu. Let's just get out of here. We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with extra Badger Sauce! Please? I'm starving.
JENNIFER	Needy, stop it. Just stop it! She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which NEEDY V.O. I watched her get into that van and I knew something awful was going to happen. But for some reason, I felt drawn toward them. Toward him. He was pale and twisted and evil, like this petrified tree I saw when I was a kid. Needy's face is fixed in the same haunted expression. Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction, PHONE CALL: CHIP Hey, Niedermeyer.
NEEDY	Thank God you're there. I hoped you were sleeping with your phone. CHIP What's wrong?
NEEDY	Jennifer's gone. She ran off with that rock band. And the Carousel burned down. CHIP sits bolt upright
CHIP	Like, burned down? To the ground? Is everyone okay?
NEEDY	No. I think they're mostly dead. CHIP Shit. You're okay, right? NEEDY We went out the bathroom window. Everyone else was trying to use the door. It was like a stampede. The people who fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking. CONTINUED: There was all this screaming and popping, like a million Black Cats all going off at once. And the smell... CHIP This is real, right? This isn't just, like, some crazy dream like last time? NEEDY No! Anyway, it took me like an hour to walk home. But Jennifer's still with those creeps! They had one of those white molester vans with no windows. The back was all blacked out.
CHIP	Who cares about Jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts? People just burned to death. In our town!
NEEDY	Oh cheese and fries! Someone's here. I'm alone, Chip. I'm freaked out!
CHIP	Where's your mom?
NEEDY	Swing shift. Listen, I'll call you in a minute. Stay awake. CHIP Holla back. Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs. As she CONTINUED:
NEEDY	Um, Jennifer? Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood- What happened? Utter silence. Then a dripping sound. Needy looks down J-Jen? Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
JENNIFER	Are you scared? Needy nods. Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and NEEDY Jennifer! But she's long gone. The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the
GOSSIPING GIRL	I heard Needy and Jennifer were there and they had to fight their way out with a machete.
OTHER GIRL	Look, she's not even moving. GOSSIPING GIRL It's called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder... Suddenly, a figure steps in front of Needy. It's JENNIFER Happy Friday!, D-bag! NEEDY You-- you're all right! CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? NEEDY Last night. At my house. You were hurt. You had two black eyes and blood everywhere and...
JENNIFER	Needy, you're delusional. I got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but I'm fine. NEEDY We had to go out that window. The bar was like, engulfed in flames! JENNIFER You do have a tendency to overreact. Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster?
NEEDY	A lot of people died, Jennifer. They burned to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled. More than half of the people there didn't make it out. It's like, all over the news. National news. Kids are dead. Parents are dead.
JENNIFER	Anyone we know?
NEEDY	We know everyone! JENNIFER Sucks to be them, I guess. She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse.
NEEDY	I don't get it. What's wrong with you? Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together.
JENNIFER	What's wrong with you? I mean, besides the obvious surface flaws. NEEDY There's no way I dreamed it. No way. NEEDY V.O. Her blood was still under my nails. See, I'd been up all night scrubbing the carnage off the linoleum.
NEEDY	Work, you...twat! Swiff, darn it! Swiff! Swiff!
NEEDY (CONT'D)	Shoot. Don't talk to yourself. It's one of your more freakish Needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords. Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer, spreading Eww, you need a mani bad. You'd better find a Chinese chick to buff your situation! CONTINUED: Here comes Handi-Snack.
MR. WROBLEWSKI	I'm sure those of you who made it here today have all heard the news. It's a dark day for Devil's Kettle, a day we can never, ever forget. A single, stifled sob rises from the class. Needy glances The administration here has decided that today will be a unstructured day of support and remembrance. We've lost nine precious students-- including Ahmet from India-- several parents, and a teacher, Ms. Parrish. He fights back tears.
JENNIFER	No way! Parrish ate shit? MR. WROBLEWSKI This tragedy is obviously beyond anything we can measure. More than ever, we need to band together and draw strength from each other. Mr. Wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his We can rise up. We can overcome death.
JENNIFER	Oh look, they're united in grief. That'll last. CHIP No band practice today. NEEDY No anything today. CHIP It's surreal, right? I mean, when just one guy dies in Devil's Kettle, it's like time stops. And now so many people are dead, nobody knows when it's okay to start again.
NEEDY	I feel guilty just breathing. CHIP Word.
NEEDY	Chip, I need to tell you something kind of weird. It's about Jennifer. CHIP What? NEEDY You know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door? That was Jennifer. But she didn't talk. She just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile. She looked like she'd been beat up or shot or something. She was all bloody. CONTINUED: And then she barfed up this disgusting prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed together. She shudders at the memory
CHIP	Yuck. Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out? NEEDY Yeah, like almost that bad! CHIP and Needy ponder the grotesque image in silence.
CHIP	It was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke.
NEEDY	No. It was something evil.
CHIP	You might want to talk to the school shrink, Needy. I'm not saying that to be a dillhole. I'm actually kinda concerned.
NEEDY	Chip, I'm a National Merit Scholar. I don't tell whoppers and I'm not crazy. CHIP I didn't say you were crazy. It's just that everyone's a little messed up about this. It's okay to feel... NEEDY Discombobulated?
CHIP	Yeah, you know. Fucked up. As they prepare to leave, COLIN GRAY approaches Needy. COLIN Hi Needy. NEEDY Oh. Hi, Colin. COLIN I heard you were there last night. In the fiery trenches. NEEDY Uh-huh. Well, I'm glad you made it out. Really.
NEEDY	Thanks.
CHIP	How are you friends with Colin Gray? I thought Colin Gray only talked to the Dead Girls. We see a group of GOTH GIRLS splayed against their
NEEDY	I just am. We have Composition together. He's a really good writer. You know-- he's so dark and emotional and all.
CHIP	Oh. I can relate. I'm also like that, even if I'm not all obvious about it like a poseur. NEEDY Walk me home?
CHIP	You know it. CONTINUED: It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder, A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely, Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling
JENNIFER	Hi!
JONAS	Oh. Hey, Jennifer. JENNIFER I'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss. You are crying about Craig, right?
JONAS	He was my best friend. Jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically.
JENNIFER	I know. I was close to him too. You know, I was there last night in that horrible place. I saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out. JONAS You-- you did?
JENNIFER	Yeah. I was probably the last person to talk to him. Like, ever. Literally.
JONAS	Wow. What did he say?
JENNIFER	Well, we got to talking about you, actually. And do you know what he said? He said you were like a brother to him. Not a bro. An actual brother. JONAS I just can't believe he's gone.
JENNIFER	I know, I know. Hey, you know what else Craig said?
JONAS	What? JENNIFER Forget it. It's too intense.
JONAS	What? Please, Jen, you've gotta tell me!
JENNIFER	Well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple. Isn't that so weird?
JONAS	He said bangin'? Jennifer reaches for Jonas's hand and slides it slowly up
JENNIFER	Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it's broken. Mine too.
JENNIFER	Come with me. Just for a while. We'll help each other get through this nightmare. It's what Craig would have wanted. Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away CHIP The whole night must be a total blur, right? NEEDY That's the thing, it's not a blur at all! I remember everything, in like ultra-high-def detail. The band, the fire, everything. Especially what happened after. CHIP "After" is the part I don't really get, to be honest. NEEDY Please, I need someone to believe me. Jennifer was-- she was destroyed. She was dying in my hallway, Chip. I saw. I used my CPR training to check her pulse. And I felt her dying, on the inside, I mean. I've known her so long that it's like sometimes I can feel what she feels. We're like E.T. and Elliot Ness. CHIP I believe you. Chip takes Needy's hand and squeezes it. NEEDY Thanks, Chipper.
JONAS	You feel so warm. Why are you so warm? JENNIFER Shutties! She pulls off Jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his JONAS Jennifer! Jen... JENNIFER What?
JONAS	Look! He gestures to the ANIMALS, who are watching, still as
JENNIFER	Mm-hmm. They're waiting. JONAS Uh, okay... Jennifer unzips Jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down
JENNIFER	Do you miss Craig? CONTINUED:
JONAS	Of course. JENNIFER Don't worry. You're going to see your buddy again.
JONAS	You mean like in heaven someday? JENNIFER No. She smiles and shakes her head. MR. WROBLEWSKI God, they're feeling so much pain. Another scream, this time weaker.
MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)	Let it all out, kids. He heads for his Ford Festiva, then pauses as if thinking Needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a CONTINUED:
NEEDY	Fried bologna is the bomb! You want some, Greedo? She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR Something's wrong... As Needy sinks to her knees, she stares straight ahead at
RADIO DJ	That was Soft Shoulder, the local band who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night. Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno, risking their own lives in the process. That's rock n' roll with a conscience, ladies and gentlemen. Had a lot of requests for that one... CONTINUED: MR. WROBLEWSKI Virgin Mother! NEEDY Crap! Needy's mom, ANTONIA "TONI" LESNICKI, has quietly entered
TONI	You said it.
NEEDY	Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't know you were awake.
TONI	I just had one of my night terrors.
NEEDY	It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror. TONI Right, right. I'm all mixed up since I started working swing again.
NEEDY	What did you dream about?
TONI	I dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit. Just like Jesus. She crosses herself piously. CONTINUED: They were trying to get to you too, but I wouldn't let `em. I'm a hard-assed, Ford-tough mama bear. NEEDY Yes you are. TONI It's like, don't y'all touch my daughter. I'll piss on you like Calvin.
NEEDY	You know, I can take care of myself, Mom.
TONI	That's what you think. One of these days you're gonna be crying out for me and I might not be there.
NEEDY	Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning?
TONI	No. I just did my scratch tickets, snorted a few Lunesta and went straight to bed. Is something going on? NEEDY Nothing. Forget it. TONI Don't nothing happen in Devil's Kettle.
TONI (CONT'D)	Anita, that ferret stinks. He needs to be washed from craw to cornhole. NEEDY Yes ma'am. Toni shakes her head and heads upstairs. A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance.
OFFICER WARZAK	We will get the man that did this to your son. You hear me? We'll get that sick M.F. JONAS'S DAD I'll get him myself! I will! You hear me, you bastard? I'll cut off your nutsack and nail it to my door! Like one of those lion doorknockers rich folks got! That'll be your balls! The SCREAMING continues across the lake. The sirens, Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her CONTINUED: Needy is sitting at her lamp-lit desk, reading an old The phone rings. Needy picks it up. NEEDY Needy speaking. PHONE CALL:
JENNIFER	I feel sooo scrumptious! She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm NEEDY Good for you. JENNIFER You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on vibrate. NEEDY Yeah. JENNIFER It's that good. Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the CONTINUED:
NEEDY	Lucky you. See, I'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town? JENNIFER Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over. Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast. She flicks a Zippo lighter and touches the FLAME to her
NEEDY	That's really nice. I tell it like it is. Besides, you should be happy for me. I'm having the best day since, like Jesus invented the calendar. NEEDY Jesus didn't invent the calendar. That's my other line. JENNIFER So blow it off.
NEEDY	It'll just be a second. JENNIFER Pooh. I'm crossing you out. She draws a mini-X in the air. Needy clicks over. It's CHIP. We get a nice trifold pie- I need to see you right now. NEEDY I can barely hear you. CHIP Camille is playing piano. Knock it off, Camille! CAMILLE You knock it off!
CHIP	Can you meet me at McCullum in ten?
CAMILLE	You knock it off, Chip! You're penis cheese!
NEEDY	Fifteen. Back on JENNIFER: Jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm. I have to go. JENNIFER What could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers?
NEEDY	I have to meet Chip at McCullum Park. JENNIFER Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What's the story down there? NEEDY I gotta go.
NEEDY	Why are the cops at your house? CHIP They're not. They're at Jonas Kozelle's house. He got murdered.
NEEDY	What?! Like, he was shot by gangbangers? CHIP No, Needy! Do you see anyone rollin' on dubs around here? Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school. Ate parts of him. They found teethmarks on him-- on the body. His voice cracks. We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of NEEDY Some animals must've got to him. CHIP Human teethmarks.
NEEDY	Who would do that? CONTINUED:
CHIP	I don't know. It just happened after school. No one's supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to the cops. Jonas's mom is catatonic. She's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue. NEEDY This can't be a coincidence. CHIP What do you mean, Needy? NEEDY A fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end? Come on!
CHIP	Don't get spooky on me, babe.
NEEDY	Seriously Chip. Most small towns only have something gruesome happen like, once every decade maybe. Devil's Kettle gets two nightmares in 24 hours? It's freaktarded. It's not right.
CHIP	What, do you think it's, like supernatural?
NEEDY	I don't know. I'm extremely intelligent but I obviously don't know everything. CHIP Well, the bad luck's gotta be over now, right? It can't get any worse, right? Obviously it can't. It can't. I mean, you agree, right? There won't be another victim. NEEDY You're shaking. CHIP I'm cold. It's very cold out here.
NEEDY	Want my sweater? CHIP It's pink.
NEEDY	Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink. She's shaking now, too. Chip leans forward and kisses In the chaste space between CHIP and Needy's bodies, the The familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a The headline of the Devil's Kettle Sun-Post simply reads: The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads:
NEEDY V.O.	We were famous. We were saints. Our town's only bar had burned to the ground and our star quarterback was somebody's Quarter Pounder. The whole country got a huge tragedy boner for Devil's Kettle. And the press-- God, they couldn't get enough of our little world of shit. We see Devil's Kettle citizens holding a tearful
MOURNERS	Through the trees, I will find you... CONTINUED: We see the PASSING OF TIME as the bouquets wilt and the The days marched on as usual, but most of us were too numb to enjoy ourselves. Most of us. We see Jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school Still, we were healing. Like CHIP, we figured things could only get better. We had faith.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	We were fucking idiots. MR. WROBLEWSKI Before the period ends, I have an announcement. CONTINUED: As you know, this is the one month anniversary of the Carousel fire and also the murder of Jonas Kozelle... JENNIFER Bo-ring!
NEEDY	Are you okay?
JENNIFER	No. I feel like boo-boo. My skin is breaking out. My hair is dull and lifeless. God, it's like I'm one of the normal girls! Needy smooths her own hair self-consciously. NEEDY Are you PMS-ing or something? JENNIFER PMS isn't real, Needy. It was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem crazy. NEEDY Oh. Mr. Wroblewski clears his throat, annoyed by their MR. WROBLEWSKI ...As I was saying, Needy and Jennifer, I finally have some good news to share with all of you. The members of the rock group Soft Shoulder have decided to extend a helping hand to our community. A ripple of excitement in the room. A girl seated in the As you know, their song "Through the Trees" has become our unofficial anthem of unity and healing. So, they've decided to release it as a benefit single. 3% of the profits will go to local families who have been affected by loss. The class is happily abuzz-- except Needy, who looks
NEEDY	What about the other 97%? MR. WROBLEWSKI Excuse me?
NEEDY	The other 97%. I mean, that's just crass. Right? She looks around for support, finding none.
NEEDY (CONT'D)	Crass. It means scummy. Greedy. Am I the only one who actually does the vocab drills?
CHASTITY	Soft Shoulder are American heroes.
NEEDY	No, they're not. I was there, Chastity. They didn't actually help anyone escape the fire. I don't even know how that rumor got started. CHASTITY Rumor?! RUMOR? It's true! It's on their Wikipedia page! NEEDY Oh, that's crap...
MR. WROBLEWSKI	GIRLS--
NEEDY	They've milked our pain-- our loss- - to get a stupid record deal! No one would even know who they were if they hadn't been playing here that night. They used us.
CHASTITY	You take that back, Needy Lesnicki! We need them now more then ever!
MR. WROBLEWSKI	That's enough. The BELL rings. Students get up and gather their books
NEEDY	I'm already sick of that song. JENNIFER Yeah. It's poorly produced. Could the bass be any lower in the mix? NEEDY No offense, but you look kind of drained. Is everything all right?
JENNIFER	I'm fine. It's just, like, wearing off or something. NEEDY What's wearing off? Are you on pot?
JENNIFER	No, dick ridge! Just forget I said anything. COLIN GRAY, the punk/goth boy we met earlier, approaches COLIN Hi. Hi, Jennifer. CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Oh, hey Colin. Listen, can I copy your bio lab again? I never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus.
COLIN	Sure. Actually, I sort of wanted to ask you something. JENNIFER Oh. You want to know if I'll go out with you. COLIN No! Well-- yeah. How did you know?
JENNIFER	Just go ahead with the pitch. Colin fidgets awkwardly.
COLIN	Well, we've been having a lot of fun in class, you and I, and I just thought maybe we could go to a movie or something. There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend...
JENNIFER	I don't like boxing movies. COLIN It's not...fuck it. Never mind. He turns to walk down the hallway, dejected. Jennifer JENNIFER Wait! Colin turns around. Why don't you just come by my place tonight? I just got Aquamarine on DVD. It's about this girl who's like, half-sushi. I guess she has sex through her blowhole or something.
COLIN	Oh. Great! Okay. JENNIFER I'll text you my address. Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly.
NEEDY	That was random.
JENNIFER	I'm used to guys asking me out. NEEDY Colin's a really nice guy. JENNIFER He's into maggot-rock. He wears nail polish.
CHIP	Hi. JENNIFER Hi Chip. Needy puts her arm around Chip protectively. I gotta go parlez French. Slam you later. Talking to your good pal Colin Gray again? NEEDY No. He was just asking Jennifer out on a date. Chip looks relieved.
CHIP	Can I come over tonight?
NEEDY	Sure. I'd like that. CHIP I went to Super Target and bought more condoms.
NEEDY	Thanks. CHIP Not that that has anything to do with my coming over. NEEDY I didn't assume that. CHIP Well, I'll see you tonight. Needy waves as Chip walks away. The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by Colin's brow furrows in confusion-- it doesn't even look CLOSE ON PHONE: The TEXT MESSAGE reads: "trn lft on camerford and your there. first house on rt. CONTINUED: Needy and CHIP are kissing on Chip's water bed.
CHIP	For ambiance. It's Jammin' Jasmine. NEEDY Mmm. CHIP My mom has Holiday Scents too, if you're interested. NEEDY No, this is nice. Colin enters the house tentatively. It's dark, vacant,
COLIN	Yo? He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4. There are piles of A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers. Jennifer? Anyone there? The music upstairs grows slightly louder in response. Needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fluorescent
NEEDY	"Sensual Swirl?" CHIP It's supposed to make it feel good for the girl. NEEDY Oh. Cool. Behind him, in the doorway, Jennifer appears, her smiling
JENNIFER	You made it.
COLIN	What's going on? This isn't really your house, is it? JENNIFER No baby. This is our house, just for you and me. We can play Mommy and Daddy. Colin is totally dumbstruck. COLIN Do you even know my last name? JENNIFER Silly. I've been sending you signals all year. Couldn't you tell? You give me such a wettie. CONTINUED: Chip fumbles below his waist, obviously struggling with
NEEDY	Oh. It's got little bumps on it. I can hardly wait. Jennifer grips Colin's face in her hands and forcibly COLIN Jennifer...
JENNIFER	You scared? I thought boys like you were into vermin.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	Nice hardware, Ace.
COLIN	No way... JENNIFER Oh, don't you dare pass out! I need you to be conscious. COLIN I gotta go... CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	I need you frightened. Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages I need you hopeless. She slams him to the ground and mounts him. Her jaw NEEDY Hopeless..hopeless... CHIP opens his eyes.
CHIP	What? Am I hurting you? Needy starts weeping. Am I too big? Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness. Skulls, Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream. CONTINUED: Needy! What's wrong? Needy continues to shriek hysterically, her voice growing We can still hear Colin making inhuman sounds of pain. We
CHIP	Is it something I did?
NEEDY	It's her. CHIP Do you need more foreplay? Needy races toward the door with Chip in pursuit.
CHIP	Needy! CONTINUED:
NEEDY	I have to go. I'm sorry. I just... feel like something...something terrible... CHIP You feel-- What does that even mean? I'm worried about you.
NEEDY	I'm so sorry, Chip. I'm so sorry. Everything is just wrong. She bolts out the room, leaving Chip naked and alone. He Needy runs toward her mom's CAR, a beat-up Kia parked on She climbs into the car and starts the ignition, She turns on the radio. The song is, of course, "Through
NEEDY	Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge! Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again. CONTINUED:
RADIO DJ	That was, of course, Soft Shoulder. They're going to be playing a benefit concert in Devil's Kettle next month. Talk about giving back to the community! Generous guys, I tell ya...
NEEDY	Mommy! Mommy? Please be home! NEEDY V.O. I've always been able to feel what she feels. Just not like this.
LITTLE JENNIFER	I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and you be her. CONTINUED:
LITTLE NEEDY	Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?
LITTLE JENNIFER	You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken. Choose.
LITTLE NEEDY	What's wrong, Jennifer?
LITTLE JENNIFER	OWWWWWW! Damn! Ass!
LITTLE NEEDY	Better. We should get a Band-Aid though.
LITTLE JENNIFER	We're sisters now, you know.
LITTLE JENNIFER (CONT'D)	Don't tell my mom about this. She'll make me get a shot.
NEEDY	I never tell on you. JENNIFER'S VOICE What's up, Monistat? Needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of
JENNIFER	God, enough screaming already. You're such a cliche. NEEDY Get out! JENNIFER But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties. She winks conspiratorially at Needy.
NEEDY	What the fuck is happening?
JENNIFER	Whoa. I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before. What's buggin'?
NEEDY	I saw you! I saw you! The car...the...I... JENNIFER Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped. NEEDY I'm calling the police.
JENNIFER	Go ahead, narc me out. I've got the cops in my back pocket. I'm fucking a cadet, remember? CONTINUED:
NEEDY	What do you want?
JENNIFER	I want to explain some things to you. You've already seen too much and besides-- best friends don't keep secrets. Right? Needy nods, terrified. Remember the night of the fire? NEEDY Yeah, it rings a bell. JENNIFER Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van.
JENNIFER	Guys? Where are we going?
NIKOLAI	Shut your mouth, object.
DIRK	Nikolai... CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Are you guys rapists?!
NIKOLAI	You wish.
MICK	Hey guys? Do we even know if she's a virgin?
JENNIFER	Yes...yes! Of course I'm a virgin! I've never done sex ever. I don't even know how. So maybe you should find some other girl who does. Know how.
NIKOLAI	Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer.
DIRK	Sure, man. NEEDY What did they do to you? JENNIFER Just let me finish. So they drove all the way out to the falls. I tried to figure out an escape, but it was so dark out there...
NIKOLAI	We got a waxing moon. Perfection.
MICK	You're the man, Wolf.
DIRK	I don't know if we should go through with this.
NIKOLAI	Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5? Or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser?
DIRK	Maroon 5.
NIKOLAI	Then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual! God.
MICK	That's it?
NIKOLAI	What? I found it on Google. CONTINUED: We come here tonight to sacrifice the body of...
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	...this chick from Devil's Kettle.
JENNIFER	My name is Jennifer.
NIKOLAI	That's fascinating.
JENNIFER	Please let me go. I'll do anything. Anything you want.
NIKOLAI	I only hump nines and tens. You're a seven at best, even with the chicken cutlets. I'm gonna carve you like a pumpkin, bitch. Don't you know that me and my boys are in league with the Beast himself?
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	We've spent months making offerings to the "man downstairs," and whaddya know? Satan delivered! We went from college radio to being courted by the majors in two months. But that's not enough, Jenny. We want designer drugs. We want groupies that have their own groupies. We want speedballs and stadium tours and Skittles sorted by color. In short, we want more. And to get more, we have to butcher you. And bleed you.
JENNIFER	Maybe you could just hire a publicist. Make some T-shirts or something. Hey, I could be on your street team!
NIKOLAI	Sorry, darling.
JENNIFER	Please...
NIKOLAI	Start chanting, boys.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)	With deepest malice, we deliver this virgin unto thee.
DIRK	Dude, that is a hot murder weapon!
NIKOLAI	It's a bowie knife.
DIRK	Bowie. Nice.
NIKOLAI	"There's a starman waiting in the sky..."
BAND	"He'd really like to meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds..."
JENNIFER	Being tortured would make most girls black out or something. But I'm so hard core, I was with them the whole time. I could feel them gutting me Under my ribs, up into my belly, then right through my heart. NEEDY They...killed you.
JENNIFER	I'm here, aren't I? She shakes her head, annoyed with Needy.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	I mean, yeah. They went Benihana on my ass. It should have killed me. But for some reason, it didn't. NEEDY Maybe it did. JENNIFER Whatever. Anyway, I don't really remember what happened after that. I just-- woke up a few hours later and found my way back, somehow.
NEEDY	I remember. JENNIFER I couldn't bring myself to hurt you. I mean, I'm a really good friend. But I felt so hungry. I had to do something.
JENNIFER	Ahmet. You made it out.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	Are you lost?
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	Does your host family know you're alive?
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	Does anyone know you're alive? CONTINUED: Come with me. We'll sort this out.
JENNIFER	Ever since then, I just somehow knew what I needed to do to be strong. And when I'm full--like I am right now--I'm like, immortal! I can do stuff like this. Jennifer jams the CUTICLE STICK into her own forearm and No biggie. Watch. She pulls out the stick. The wound seals over instantly.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	That's some X-Men shit, right? NEEDY What do you mean, "when you're full"?
JENNIFER	You know. Full. Like full of tasty morsels. Needy shakes her head, not comprehending. Forget it. You'd probably tell on me anyway. Not that anyone would believe you. You always think the world is coming to an end.
NEEDY	What about my mom's Kia? Why did you attack me out there? Why were you covered in blood? You didn't even look human. Jennifer rolls her eyes. CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	You should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you're having. We're all concerned. Especially Chip. I think he's having second thoughts about you.
NEEDY	Leave!
JENNIFER	My, aren't we a C-U-Next-Tuesday? NEEDY GET OUT!
JENNIFER	Come on. Let me stay the night. We can play "boyfriend/girlfriend" like we used to. She smiles seductively.
NEEDY	What are you doing?
JENNIFER	You said to leave. So I'm outtie-
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	See you at school. She LEAPS gracefully out the window. CONTINUED:
One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on	PRIEST We gather here today to celebrate the life of Colin Gray, who was plucked from the prime of... The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the What is this disturbance?
MR. GRAY	These are Colin's friends. A GOTH BOY runs up to the grave and drops to his belly.
GOTH BOY	Colin! Take me with you! I belong down there! In the DAAAARKNESS!
GOTH GIRL	No, Kevin. Those are just his fleshly remains. He's among the dark angels of the realm now. Fly, Colin. Fly into the firmament. She lights a bundle of SAGE and waves it in the air. GOTH BOY Is it cool if we camp here for a few days? We want to commune with his corpse. He was our spooky homeboy.
PRIEST	Children, this is a private service for family only. GOTH GIRL Oh, right. I need to ask you something, Mrs. Gray. It's really important for me to have closure. PRIEST Young lady, have some respect for this family... MRS. GRAY No. It's fine.
GOTH GIRL	Is it true that Colin had a date with Jennifer Check the night he was killed? Because Jennifer Check is a social disease. She's not like us. She thinks she's so special just because she's popular and and is what "society" considers "attractive." But she's not sincere. She's about as emo as a breast implant! And she listens to Jessica Simpson and shops at Hollister. And I just know Colin would never go out with someone like that, and I just need confirmation. From you. So did he? MR. GRAY Did he...?
GOTH GIRL	Have a date with Jennifer Check. Colin's parents stare at the ground.
GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)	Oh God. Oh God. I knew it! That BITCH! I will erase her! I'll put a freaky Druid spell on her! I'll spell her preppy ass right into the ground! The parents flinch.
GOTH BOY	Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered Colin. All Jennifer Check did was invite him over to watch Aquamarine. GOTH GIRL That's WORSE! She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and
GOTH BOY	Colin wouldn't have liked this.
MRS. GRAY	Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah, you're right! I'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have liked being eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and buried before his eighteenth birthday! Wow, you must have known him so well! MR. GRAY Jill... The goth boy looks terrified. But Mrs. Gray's not done MRS. GRAY By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. I'd know-- I had to identify the remains. My boy's not in the realm of the undead. He's not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame. He's in an overpriced rosewood box that's headed six feet downtown. She kicks the coffin to illustrate. So you can take your pain and shove it up your asses, kids. I got the monopoly on pain! The kids stare at her in awe. Needy watches as Mrs. Gray Needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka. NEEDY V.O. They did a big memorial assembly for Colin at school, and we had to watch another presentation about curfews and the buddy system and how to deal with grief. But nobody seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was last week's emotion.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since our encounter in my room. Actually, I hadn't really spoken to anyone. I was busy with research. Paranormal research. Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes. As Jennifer as a grinning death mask. Jennifer as a corpse, Chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie.
CHIP	Hey. Did you buy Turnabout tickets yet? I don't get paid until next week. CONTINUED:
NEEDY	I gotta show you something. CHIP What is it?
NEEDY	Not here. Behind the school. CHIP What is it? NEEDY Evidence. CHIP Is this about Jennifer?
NEEDY	Yes, but I promise you this is the last thing I need to show y-- CHIP Needy, I care about you. A lot. As a person, not just a girl I made love to for four minutes the other night. And I'm scared of what's happening to you. You're acting really fucked up. NEEDY Please just let me show you. Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. It's
NEEDY	Look at this. She thrusts a piece of paper into CHIP's hands. CONTINUED:
CHIP	Demon...demonic... NEEDY Demonic transference. It's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan without using an actual virgin! CHIP stares at her. I think that's what happened to Jennifer. Those guys from that band were trying to sacrifice her in the woods. But what they didn't realize is that she hasn't been a virgin since junior high! Jennifer's a total cum-dumpster! It all makes sense now! Read this... She grabs the piece of paper from him. "If the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be attained, but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim. She must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon." See? CHIP looks more dubious than ever.
CHIP	Uh-huh. NEEDY She's eating boys! They make her strong. Really strong. And when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends. And look at this... She holds up one of the printouts. It says that before the demon feeds, it vomits a gruesome substance on its prey. Like I saw!
CHIP	You--you really think Jennifer killed Jonas and Colin? NEEDY And possibly Ahmet from India.
CHIP	Really? You think she ate those guys?
NEEDY	No. No! Of course not!
CHIP	Is that what you think?
NEEDY	No...Listen, I'll make an appointment with Mr. Feely. I'm real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia. My hormones and emotions are aswirl, and my moods are erratic... CHIP isn't totally convinced, but his face softens.
CHIP	It's all right, Needy.
NEEDY	This has been a crummy school year, Chip. CHIP No shit. Needy turns and pitches the black binder into a Dumpster.
NEEDY	Listen, I'm done with all that devil stuff. Do you know what you're wearing to Turnabout? CHIP I was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere, right here.
NEEDY V.O.	I was so in love with him. I didn't want to mess it up with my infectious crazy. Only I wasn't actually crazy. Everyone else was crazy. But when you're the only sane one, you might as well be crazy. It's subjective, you know?
CHIP	What color dress are you gonna wear? I need to order your wrist corsage.
NEEDY	I don't know yet.
CHIP	How about magenta? You're definitely a winter. My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta. Or possibly teal.
NEEDY	Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady.
CHIP	Well, they call them "sales reps" now. NEEDY Right. Well, I'll try to find something magenta. CHIP That'll look dope.
EVENING	A group of student council kids are putting the finishing CONTINUED:
TONI	You look beautiful.
NEEDY	I look pork stupid.
TONI	No, you've got that tiny waist, like a fashion model. I always thought you looked like Cindy Crawford. She gently takes off Needy's glasses.
NEEDY	Who's Cindy Crawford? TONI One of the great beauties of our time. She's even got a mole like you, except hers is on her face. She takes a section of Needy's hair and wraps it around
NEEDY	Ow! You're too close to my neck. TONI Well, if Chip gives you a hickey, you can just tell everyone I burned you.
NEEDY	Gross, Mom. Chip isn't that ostentatious.
TONI	Now that's a word you don't hear every day. Hold still.
NEEDY	What are you doing to my hair? TONI Hooker helmet.
NEEDY	Aw, jeez Mom! TONI If you can't have big what-nots, you might as well have big hair! Chip is standing in underwear and black dress socks,
CHIP	I'm in underpants, Mom! We hear the voice of CHIP'S MOM through the door.
CHIP'S MOM	I need to give you something. CHIP Hang on. Chip puts on a robe and opens the door. Ladies' pepper spray?
CHIP'S MOM	I've been thinking about it for a while, and I think you need to be carrying this. There's obviously a sicko out there who likes boys. Boys your age. And I don't want you going out there unarmed.
CHIP	I can take care of myself. I've been using the Bowflex. In the background, we can see the BOWFLEX with clothes CHIP'S MOM Did you hear what Colin Gray looked like when they found him? CONTINUED:
CHIP	Lasagna with teeth? CHIP'S MOM You heard. So unless you want to wind up looking like another exotic Eye-talian dish, take Mommy's rape spray. Chip reluctantly accepts the spray. Are you picking Needy up at her house?
CHIP	Meeting her at the dance. I'm gonna walk. It's so warm outside. It's like 40.
CHIP'S MOM	I want pictures with your sister before you go.
CHIP	Yes, ma'am. The mother/daughter photo looks ghastly. Toni's eyes are CHIP'S MOM One more. Back to back. Big smiles. Camille, we don't touch ourselves down there. That's our lady garden.
GOTH GIRL	This is my heart. My soul.
GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)	Everything I once believed in. Another GOTH GIRL, looking exasperated, grabs a balloon,
GOTH GIRL #2	Your abortion. Your other abortion.
GOTH GIRL	I hate your guts, Madison. The girls glare at each other. Chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance. Across the park, he sees a STRAY DOG trotting toward him. A few SQUIRRELS emerge from the trees, gazing curiously
MR. WROBLEWSKI	Can I have everyone's attention please? The students turn to look at him, annoyed by the CONTINUED:
MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)	Welcome to the Turnabout Dance. I hope you've all had an opportunity to consume the Pecan Sandies and Cran-Grape that were so generously donated by the Parents Club. But the real treat is yet to come. It's happening right about now, this treat of which I speak. We have some very special guests tonight. They were kind enough to take a break from their sold-out national tour and play our dance for free. CHIP! CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer Didn't you hear me calling your name?
CHIP	You weren't calling my name. JENNIFER Yes, I was. CHIP I couldn't hear it.
JENNIFER	I think you were maybe spacing out. You were like this: Derrrrr. She mimics a blank, drooling expression.
CHIP	I was? CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I need to talk to you about you-know- who. Our little Needy. CHIP I know.
JENNIFER	Are you worried? `Cause I'm super- stressed about her. God knows how I even sleep at night. CHIP She hasn't been the same for weeks.
JENNIFER	I think I know what's wrong with her. In fact, I know I know what's wrong with her.
CHIP	Then tell me.
JENNIFER	I feel bad telling you this. Okay, you know Needy's been a total Lithium candidate since the night Colin Gray died. But that's not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff. It's because....I don't wanna say this.
CHIP	Say it! JENNIFER Needy and Colin were intimate. By that I mean he was poking her donut on a semi-regular basis. I know this must be hard for you to hear.
CHIP	Needy's not like that.
JENNIFER	That's what she wants you to believe. But trust me, her and Colin were doing stuff you haven't even heard of. Total varsity moves.
CHIP	But you were with Colin the night he was killed.
JENNIFER	Well, apparently he had a thing for me-- no surprise there. And I figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that night, so I agreed to a little pity date. Colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy. But he wanted to go too far, so I left after a few minutes. Next thing I knew, they'd found... She sniffles, wiping her eye. ...what was left of him.
CHIP	Eye-talian.
JENNIFER	Huh? CHIP Never mind.
JENNIFER	I'm sorry you had to hear this from me. I'm just so worried about Needy. She's losing her shit. Colin was her everything. I wouldn't be surprised if she winds up in the nuthouse.
CHIP	I just can't believe this.
JENNIFER	Well, you've been talking to her more than I have. How bad is it? CHIP It's bad, man. It's bad.
JENNIFER	I can only imagine the paranoid theories she's come up with.
CHIP	Oh, you have no idea. JENNIFER I just can't believe she would do this to you. I care so much about you, Chip.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)	More than I've ever had the guts to admit.
MR. WROBLEWSKI	Boys and girls, please welcome...Soft Shoulder! The heavy stage curtains part to reveal SOFT SHOULDER in
NIKOLAI	Good evening, babies. Are you ready for some bad vibrations? Needy looks as though she's had a revelation. A look of NEEDY Chip! CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Needy didn't deserve a boy like you.
NEEDY V.O.	One thing people don't know about me is that I'm fast. I just never went out for track because I look bad in shorts. Also, Jennifer told me track was for lezzies. But I am. Fast, I mean. Even in that fucking afterbirth of a dress, I could really tear up the asphalt. I had to. I was running for his life. Jennifer is kissing Chip. She pulls him down onto the
JENNIFER	Ooh, you're so salty! CHIP Yeah, you too. JENNIFER Say it like you mean it.
CHIP	You're so salty. I need water. It burns. The salty burns my mouth. CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Say I'm better than Needy. CHIP What? Why? JENNIFER We really shouldn't be doing this. She pulls away from him, feigning a guilty conscience.
CHIP	You're better than Needy. Jennifer smiles, satisfied.
JENNIFER	Natch. She resumes kissing him enthusiastically.
CHIP	This feels weird. Can we go somewhere else? JENNIFER I have just the place.
CHIP	Murphy Pool? I don't think we can go in there. I knew some skater guys who went in there. They got in big trouble and now they have to pick up garbage for 100 hours. Jennifer giggles and pulls him along.
JENNIFER	You're in big trouble anyway. Come on. CONTINUED: NEEDY Well, hi there Camille! Is Chipper home? CHIP's mother appears and shoves Camille aside.
CHIP'S MOM	Needy? Is something wrong? NEEDY Where's Chip?
CHIP'S MOM	He left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago. He certainly should have been there by now.
NEEDY	He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous, godless times-- you let your only son walk alone at night?
CHIP'S MOM	Well, it's only five blocks. My God, your hair is... NEEDY Which way did he go? CHIP'S MOM He usually cuts across the park. She turns to scold Camille. Camille, let's sit like a lady! No one wants to see your kiki. She turns back to address Needy.
CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)	Why don't you try... But Needy's gone.
CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)	Anita? Murphy Pool is even eerier from the inside. The fenced-in CHIP shivers and looks around nervously.
CHIP	Aren't you cold?
JENNIFER	Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma. She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to CHIP What are you doing? JENNIFER Swimming. CHIP Ha ha.
JENNIFER	Come on in, Chip. Show me your breast stroke. CHIP The water looks disgusting. JENNIFER It's not so bad.
CHIP	Are you kidding? It's totally bubonic in there. I think I see a dead possum with a Doritos bag in its pouch. And that looks like a used syringe over there... He slaps away a FLY. CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	I'm sorry. I was just trying to make you laugh. I think now, more than ever, we need laughter. We've both lost a close friend. CHIP nods sadly.
CHIP	I know.
JENNIFER	I feel so empty. CHIP Me too. JENNIFER Please come here and kiss me again. Make all this madness go away. Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees. The sound of buzzing flies grows louder. NEEDY Chip! A terrified SCREAM in the distance. CONTINUED: I'm coming! She flings herself over the top of the fence, her body Needy staggers toward the pool, which is surrounded by an
CHIP	Needy! NEEDY Holy crap!
NEEDY (CONT'D)	Saint Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes: Please give me the power to crush this bitch. Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly- CONTINUED:
JENNIFER	Fuck this J.V. shit! Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess,
CHIP	She can fly? NEEDY She's just hovering, CHIP. It's not that impressive. Jennifer speaks in a metallic, demonic-sounding voice.
JENNIFER	God, do you have to undermine everything I do? You're such a player-hater.
NEEDY	You're a jerk. JENNIFER Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire. Got any more harsh digs?
NEEDY	You know what? You were never a good friend. Ever. Even when we were little. You used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played Barbies! JENNIFER And now I'm eating your boyfriend! See? At least I'm consistent. NEEDY Why do you need him? Huh? She begins to weep.
NEEDY (CONT'D)	Why do you need the one guy who's ever liked me? You can have anyone, Jennifer! The cutest guy in school. The mailman. A teacher. You could probably even have a huge star like Chad Michael Murray. So why Chip? Why him? Is it just to piss me off? Or is it because you're insecure?
JENNIFER	I am not insecure. God, what a joke! How could I be insecure? I was the Snowflake Queen! NEEDY Yeah, two years ago. When you were socially relevant. JENNIFER I AM STILL SOCIALLY RELEVANT!
NEEDY	You were skinny then, too! A look of ABJECT HORROR on Jennifer's face. She reels
JENNIFER	I'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, Lesnicki. Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background,
NEEDY	I thought you only murdered boys.
JENNIFER	I go both ways. She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white- Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence. Ow-Ow-Ow. Needy watches, and realizes Jennifer is injured. Blood NEEDY We hurt you...
JENNIFER	Got a tampon? Needy shakes her head mutely. Thought I'd ask. You seemed like you might be pluggin'.
NEEDY	Where are you going?
JENNIFER	Fuck this noise. I'm out. You losers are more trouble then you're worth. She continues climbing. NEEDY Why give up now? He's almost dead! Get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both!
JENNIFER	Nah. I mean, you say I've been a bad friend all these years. I might as well throw you a bone. Once Jennifer has disappeared, Needy turns her attention NEEDY Oh, Chip! CHIP Needy. You saved me.
NEEDY	I'm gonna call for help.
CHIP	Oh no, I'm out of minutes!
NEEDY	I think 911 is always a free call.
CHIP	Oh yeah. You're right.
NEEDY	It's not working. It's full of Jennifer-goo. CHIP Hey, I'm going somewhere... NEEDY No! You're not going anywhere!
CHIP	I'm toast, Needy. I'm definitely gonna die. I think I already died before you were here, but I woke up when I heard your voice.
NEEDY	I love you. CHIP Yeah me too. And you look hot in that dress.
NEEDY	You're clearly delirious.
CHIP	No. When you're dying, you can see everything a lot clearer. You can see what's true and what's not. The things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them, like a picture of the Baby Jesus, or Barbara Walters when they use the special lens. And I know for sure that you're totally hot. You'd better get out of here. The police are going to come and I don't want them to, you know, make a mistake.
NEEDY	I'm never leaving.
CHIP	But I have to go. NEEDY No! Chip's eyes close. His face relaxes. He's gone. Soft Shoulder are still playing onstage, their guitars CONTINUED:
DIRK	This sucks old-man balls. NIKOLAI Shut up. It's good PR. I said, it's so good to be here! The students cheer approvingly, their faces bright and In the background, yet another oblivious COUPLE are
GIRL	What are you looking at, Clumpy? NEEDY Just watching your old man try to suck the ugly off your face.
GUY	What did you say? The guy takes a good look at Needy and blinks, startled. Are you supposed to be Goth or something? CONTINUED:
NEEDY	Did you know the original Goths were a Germanic tribe that settled in Rome? They didn't wear black. They wore regular linen tunics. I don't know why nobody else knows that. She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk.
NIKOLAI	We gotta get out of here. DIRK Why?
NIKOLAI	I think this girl's flipping out.
DIRK	What could she do to us?
NIKOLAI	Look at her. Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his CONTINUED: NEEDY You didn't play your hit yet. But they're gone. Needy looks out at her classmates. They stare back. She They found Chip the following morning. The police couldn't find an explanation for the "substance" in the pool, so they chose not to mention it to the press. In fact, they treated the whole incident like a bad dream.
NEEDY	Trouble was, some of us would never wake up. Needy is lying in bed, shaking, her arm in a cast. Her NEEDY V.O. I never went back to school after that. Didn't talk much either. My mom bought some books so she could teach me at home like crazy Christians with 14 kids do. But I wasn't a very cooperative student. CONTINUED: Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity
NEEDY V.O.	What nobody realized was that I was doing a different kind of homework. I was watching her every night. Waiting. We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	Waiting for her to get weak and dull. Waiting for her to burn through the life-force she'd stolen from Chip. It took weeks, but I finally made my move. Remember? Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing. NEEDY V.O. Even in her last moments of life, she somehow managed to be cooler than me. CONTINUED:
NEEDY	She left an insanely hot corpse. We're back in solitary confinement, where Needy has been
NEEDY V.O.	I don't even know who Needy Lesnicki is anymore. I'm a different person now. A person who uses curse words and kicks orderlies and and sees things that aren't there. A very bad, very damaged person.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)	But sometimes, change can be good. For instance, most occult scholars don't know this, but if you're bitten by a demon--and you live-- you just might absorb some of the demon's abilities. In the moonlight, we see Needy still has a infected- You just might get lucky for once in your miserable life. CONTINUED:
NEEDY	"Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you..." Someone has brought a CD player, and the mourners sing VIGIL ATTENDEES "...And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again..." CONTINUED:
NEEDY	"...We'll meet again." A small creek emptying into a stream runs parallel to the Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband. The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,
OLD MAN	Where you looking to go, young lady?
NEEDY	East, toward Madison.
OLD MAN	East, huh? Guess I'm headed that way. But I'm gonna need you to pay me in ass, gas or grass. Got that? No free rides in this wagon.
NEEDY	I don't have any money or drugs, so you'll have to settle for ass.
OLD MAN	Fair enough. Hop in my chariot. Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat. So why you headed East?
NEEDY	I'm following this rock band.
OLD MAN	Huh. Must be a hell of a group. NEEDY Tonight's gonna be their last show. The station wagon pulls off. As it sputters off into the RADIO DJ What a song. Thought we'd play that one in honor of Soft Shoulder. They're playing in Madison tonight. Should be a night to remember... The DJ's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the
