CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
To Princeton University's Director	of Admissions: In considering me for a scholarship you have asked for, and have every reason to expect, an essay from me about myself. And, as a clever high school graduate, I of course realize the subtext of this essay about who I am and why I want to enter Princeton, is actually to make clear to you why you should have me. I have gotten tips, from friends who have preceded me to college, that being a Latina, with my grades, list of activities and relative poverty, I am as good as in if I simply do the dance and work in a word like "bipolarization" every so often. And while I love dances -- this dance of self is one I am afraid to master. I prefer to write about my mother. eleven years ago was a watershed not because of my father's imprisonment but because it was my first day at school....
There was never any pretense that	the gorgeous, vital, clever, temperamental animal that was my mother ever for a heartbeat considered having any life of her own.

Each night my mother promised me a	wonderful life.. Each night I looked for a new expressive way to tell my mother how much I loved her. The child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her and every time I looked up my mother was in the process of saving us.
Desperation in her hands was our	weapon.
With this weapon she had her	marriage annulled - usually impossible for the poor - and somehow convinced an associate of my father's to transport two Mexicans North in style. How you doing? Hi. How are you? I am fine.. ..happy, merry, joyful, glad, contented, frisky. As they taxi. Are you her mother, sister..what? The mother says, "solo español"---"only Spanish."

My mother's prayer for us, which	she made me repeat exactly, represented a stunning look into our future. "Please God, let only the bad things change." Telephone? Por favor. Por favor. He glances over..this is not lechery, it is art
My mother had redefined her own	passions. Blaming herself for the father she gave me, she would never again be lured by a man's rough edges..She had decided that goodness would be her catnip. Texas... The mother hurries her along in the direction of distant Texas.
Mamá, Texas..	She raises her fingers like pistols. Shoots, blows in them GIRL mother's anguish. She loved and lived to talk. Now, as if by a witch's spell, words were no longer her bridge but her barrier. In a very real sense she feared she had left herself behind.
We moved into a place managed by my	mother's aunt. My mother worked two jobs in two local stores paying a total of 450 dollars a week... Cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the If only I could have stayed six. The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to: BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming

Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody	finds a blue..You know how a blue happens? I mean, before the ocean blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody had to throw away an old Milk of Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk of Magnesia is?

Please.. advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for stones..what is the word for this.. hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor CRISTINA AS FLOR name for the act..what you did.. rough.

Before Flor can react. John upset. It might not look it but I am good at getting things. Doing something about it is something else..I was going to talk to you before I actually gave her the money..but maybe I should have checked before I started the whole thing. I know what it's like when you feel your kid is being messed with..I get the message. It won't happen again. It's late..I'm sure we'd all like... lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up. enough to be helped by some little apology, I would be a fool to bring it up..I need to say more no matter what the result. I need to be impolite. You leave someone else's child alone. It's simple, no?

John speaks with sudden volume and turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a you didn't do the same thing... No!

Is there a real difference between that and what you are complaining about? waits for a comeback from her mother to the right thing keeping it to myself. It felt disloyal to Deborah..but my daughter really needed someone to be kind to her right then..so..so. right. Hypocrisy..yes. JOHN I'll tell you, it's pretty wild to say something and have the other person just concede the point. I'm dazed here. for you and... talk like this?
You can't quit even if you want to	and you know why. is worried as John looks right at her..Is he coming on?
Because then Cristina will blame	herself for costing you the job...and that guilt...I don't know if you know about guilt.. doesn't have to check with her mother on this one. Catholics. Culpa, si..Por Dios, Si. We know. We know. gestures that there is nothing to be done. Flor nods. JOHN She smiles..gets up..extends her hand..they shake. backs to John, daughter following mother...Flor speaks to her daughter. No te puedo tener haciendo esto por mi. Ahora tengo que aprender inglÈs. I can't have you doing this for me. I must learn English now. That translates to "No, I meant that for you, not John." But
Learning English would cost five	hundred and ninety nine dollars down and 15 monthly payments of one hundred and ten dollars...which represents 48 percent interest..Mexicans marketing Mexicans. But not a penny was wasted.
My mother showed an extraordinary	facility for learning the language. obsessive work ethic, which blocked out all else..She was her daughter's mother. As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a Hey, boy, I can use some up company. But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of she speaks English, at this point, her words are

No.	Sorry. out..don't be a smart ass. Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate mostly in apologies anyway..I'm sorry. I should be whipped. I should be stoned- it's been a while - I meant to say, I think, don't be smart, don't be kind, don't be sensitive, don't be beautiful. I meant to say, "hi, Flor, good night Flor..that show you're watching is going to be a hit." staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and you go with my mother?
Well, your mother just said she	could use my help on a few errands while you're in class... Bernice nods. Then unconsciously moans. I'm not sure I can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class..in this case math...and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you've learned math -- so they make you go to summer school..It helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission. a real sense of humor. Thank you, God. Joking...
That you're better at everything	than I am...and I was thanking God for there being this one thing where I might have my nose in front. Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother.
Sexual experience..	Cristina laughs. That one even she knows is funny. Cristina gives Bernice an appreciative push from behind. own, everything on Bernice's summer reading list..And she's two grades behind..Imagine if she went to Bernice's school..And they'd kill to give her a scholarship. Yeah..she's so open to new things.
Can't find my keys..	Another woman, ARLENE FOLSOM, calls to her.. Hi, Arlene.. Come on. They walk to greet Arlene. always raving about..This is Arlene Folsom..the school director. Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Folsom. I couldn't believe how beautiful the grounds were as we drove in. I just think the balance of the buildings to open ground is so wonderful and must have been very difficult to achieve. Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression NARRATOR
The experience was literally mind	boggling. My mind did boggle. My cranial cells stunned. Even if I had enough sense of wonder to imagine such a school existed; my sense of fairness made it unthinkable that any school could offer this much more than my own.. this one on me. I've got to finish packing up. I just don't....Out of space this school wants her to go for free? want diversity...Cristina knocked her out...I had nothing to do with it. By the way, the scholarship is worth twenty thousand dollars. And early registration is tomorrow. phrase is "NO, thank you." CRISTINA heart and make her understand what this school would mean. Thanks for never judging me..Love you. Love everybody. That's what's killing me.. Sleep well. JOHN
Me?	Deborah will be home soon. I just talked to her. John does not answer immediately. The brief pause is noted.
Sure.....	You have me a little worried... He glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are
You know about Cristina and your	great school? you nuts? do. Such an important thing. JOHN that's because they keep sending my daughter home anxiety-ridden, mostly over geometry..I mean you "get" Bernice..In a decent world her school should let her know how great she is, right? my own kid there. Bernice. Nothing is going to change that heart. looks at her..Out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone It's great to hear someone else say that out loud..Hard to explain. Ah, man.. It will be okay. Your, "Ah, man" was for me? You think I am in trouble with Cristina? To know you're not just making something out of nothing. That when you think you're at some crossroads - you are. ....I never know a man who can put himself in my place like you do. How do you become that man? Jews in the desert and wait five thousand years. Then, bingo, somebody else who can see trouble coming but can't do anything about it. talking about.. sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way damn wind. sits. It helps. good. I think if she goes there it will be one of two things..either she will be odd...or she will make herself the same as them. That is EXACTLY the way I felt about Bernice going there..Exactly. I wasn't able to think it that clearly...But that's how I felt. So between odd and the same...you gotta root for odd, don't you? Camera begins to pull back...early in the move John's words Flor nods ruefully..then suddenly off a glance at him.
Not all crummy.	Suddenly there is a bit of danger..she rises quickly, She turns.. She gulps and exits...as the CAMERA PULLS BACK..ending the BERNICE You just made it...I was getting worried.. has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to This is one of Bernie's old..ancient backpacks. taking it...
Oh, thank you..	she shoulders it and almost falls over.. This is a great school. I got you a little first-day-at-a- new-school present... school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain Okay? It is a big day. uncertain reaction is taken as a yes. What did we get her? hands Cristina a locket..then, noting Flor's It's from ALL of us. Your mother too. It's not from me... Deborah does a good-natured "TAKE" accepting Flor's reaction This is so great. It fills your heart, doesn't it? Deborah turns and sees Flor has already started doggedly up
There is a terrible crisis which	comes when your own personality is not equal to the challenge you face. When being who you are no longer works. Deborah has started to jog. As she approaches Flor, she calls Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk Deborah is close behind now. Why am I not surprised you're competitive? Deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck. Flor stays on task ..forces her stride. She just needs to win Flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it I love you for trying.
When people exist under one roof, a	tiny society forms..the stuff of novelas: masters and servants unconsciously dancing in lock step so that, when things go wrong, traumas converge.
No. I've given up drinking.	I had to do it John..I need every brain cell to watch out for all of us..given the current climate. Anyway. John, I think you're great and I'm going to act accordingly. Good deal.
My great Aunt Monica had finally	managed to get her mother to Los Angeles and my mother was making a party. helped me understand real optimism. As they pull in the driveway. Cristina and her friends exit Flor? Deb..Look, sorry to call you so late, but they're still studying and I'm going out but I promised to get her back so if you want me to cut off the school work, fine...whatever you want me to do. Well, okay..you think about it.. And hey, if you're tired, or want to play, let her sleep here and I'll get her back there tomorrow. You still want to think about it? Okay.. She hangs up...and exchanges a mischievous look with
Though it is possible to judge	harshly my conduct toward my mother in my first year at school; almost all professional literature excuses my behavior as developmental, since I was entering an age where rebellion and narcissism were to be expected. And I was being mentored. Monica and her newly arrived mother are there along with the Wait! Deborah turns, startled. honey. late..I was looking all over for you...keep an eye on the kids. You know my secret cell number.
Just give me a moment to talk	here.. Yes. Nobody noticed -- which shows I probably conducted myself pretty well as a drunk. But duty called and I'm sober so may I say just one thing. lose your husband and you'll never find someone as good. There will only be men who you know are cheap and shallow and have no real warmth in their souls. You may have gotten by on those surfaces once but now you've been spoiled by a good man and you can no longer glide on such thin ice. If you do not act quickly you will soon cement an awful fate for yourself. A life, with no hope of repair, which has already begun to turn desperate and dumb. That's it. Drive safely. She grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the If we're out of coffee, it's over for me. Suddenly a sharp horn is heard..Evelyn jumps..then turns to hate myself..One of the things I can count on..
Honey, lately your low self-esteem	is just good common sense. Deborah considers that last thought for a long beat before But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs.. What the hell's wrong? urge you not to go up there. But he is already moving quickly up the stairs..As he turns Denouement. He is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but down..I suddenly get what I have to do...I just have to get the guts.
Is it absolutely necessary to make	it this...this scary..can you just say it? Yeah..come on..it's me. We can talk. seeing another man for the last eleven weeks and it was nothing and I ended it tonight..At first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate market..Then it was...what? Me being insecure and looking for some ridiculous vali... missing what you're saying..You can't just keep talking and expect me to follow it when you start the way you did.......
Well there was the crack in the	planet. That was noisy... looks at him...a solid beat... head.....no kidding.. he does the noise... I met him about... holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself takes that as a cue to start.. puts up his hand.. hear you..there's a lot going through my mind....Have you said yet whether you slept with him? a flirtation because the really important thing for you to know... had sex with someone else? Because I really am missing most of your words. So help me out here.. DEBORAH for the first ten weeks there was almost nothing to ... You still haven't said, right? of asking you whether.. stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished second. manners for keeping her I'm just trying to figure out whether there's any way to avoid knowing..no, damn There's not... Okay, you're on..real short answer, huh? Have you had sex with another.. Ahhhh...I'm getting there, yes. John? I think if you let me tell you the full everything of this we'd be in a position to deal with it better..because eleven weeks ago when... JOHN words..I get three or four tops...and then just see your mouth moving with nothing coming out and then I spin out and there's this noise...But there's no way to miss a "yes" or "no." Yes.. Really? I made up my mind that I would answer every question you had..I'll answer anything and everything and more. What other questions could there be?
Are you really that much nicer than	me? high. He get up and starts to exit.. think if you listen to exactly what happened and then do whatever you need to...we'll..just let me tell you everything.. The doorbell rings...it's quite late...Deborah wondering Mrs. Clasky. I want to quit. right this minute.. tonight after I ended the whole yuck thing..I was feeling human. I'm done with what's his name..a relief... ..and now it can be like it never happened and then I thought that the only hope was that I own that it did happen and that I take my medicine here..because if I'm walking around with what I did and you don't know what I did..there is a real limit to how close we can be..you're with me and I'm this person who has this bad secret and we aren't really on the same page ever again..so the reason I took this chance in telling -- is because I want us to be good..I want us to be close. I want to feel like you're not nuts to be in love with me..So what I think is we should talk till we pass out .. Talk till we're so sick of each other that there's nothing left to do but take the first step out of hell..So please let's not leave this room until you've heard and said everything..please say, okay.. She awaits his answer..He has heard barely a few words.. DEBORAH
I've got to get out of	here..because you keep talking. Stay put! She does. Just before he exits. He exits. when you're this upset and the other kids are right there and... Flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room. here. "no" let me at last say the reason. At least that will be a relief. Have you no idea that I.... right now.. John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these Another toss and Flor follows John out the door. I'm taking you. Why?!? about you and I can't handle that right now, okay? Flor emits a crooning sound.
Ahhhhh.	I never made that sound over a man before.. Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii! For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while.. that word sometime. I can really use it. She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her.. As he turns onto Sunset.
Oh, shut up and stop telling me	what to do. besides driving me home where my daughter isn't. because I'm a housekeeper and you don't have to think. man..You don't know where I come from. responsible no more for making sure nothing happens. That's another terrible job I quit. responsibility for anything within a block. You have nothing to worry about. That's my job. figure out what we do, right? points to a mall..He looks at her and pulls in. You have never seen me!
So,	"man," where we heading? is.. perfect. He heads for the kitchen. I'm going to cook beautifully. He turns.
We both were not normal because we	are angry and we act like we are angry with each other and we are not..I am not. I am glad to be with you. It feels comfortable to be with you. If I just left the job and never spoke with you it would have been sin. You understand? He stands next to her and, for want of a better physical new way of making out.. His hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they body..every other part wants to jump off a cliff. FLOR If the other hand could cheer up, you could lift me up and carry me off. He laughs. He takes his hand from around her. It is a bit one. I think I already broke my record for smooth. I can get you fed. He goes to the kitchen. She begins to explore a little. She are not on a date... Hey, Flor? She enters the room...dancing a bit.. FLOR
Just lighting candles and picking	music. Oooh. gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet
You want a drink?	considers the question totally..He is busy cooking..not
Huh?	regards him levelly..then makes her decision.
No.	gets out a bottle of vodka. either. the equipment I'd inject the vodka. starts to pour.
Wait!	I think it is so important that we are each clear-headed. looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. Flor
It is very good that you did not	ask, "why?" Keep things real, right? I wouldn't have put it so well. taste..forever. at cooking for you. I'm very glad you liked it. He looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a imagine over here...scratch that..the last thing you want to hear is somebody going off on your looks. detail. should name a gender after you..Looking at you doesn't do it..Staring is the only thing that makes sense..and trying not to blink so you don't miss anything. She squeals with laughter..He laughs a little himself and in that you are drop-dead, crazy- gorgeous..so much so that I am really considering looking at you again before we finish up here. And now he looks at her.
Utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before	to dance or kiss. He stands. She stands..He kids just a bit, clowning at
No contest.	They kiss. What do you mean? song. Joking around. I don't know what I'm talking about... She breaks and heads for the dining room. John has a moment
This song...You see what a good	thing to tell you how you talk like a Mexican song. through my veins.. Gardens of flowers blossom in my body. starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past
And you wander along my fertile	soil, picking its ripe fruit..A nightingale undresses on my tongue..And under its wings.. laughs. She stops cold. Looks down..though just seconds took out of you but tell me how to get it back in there..I'm sorry. Flor..I'm sorry. looks at her...they kiss..It is a kiss without an author. anyone..Did nightingales undress on your tongue? looks at him with enormous warmth. Her arms looped Yeah...
My mother never told me the details	of her visit to the restaurant. But she often referred to it as the greatest conversation of her life.
Oh, Johnny, why is everything so	damn confusing?
Culpa.	Flor's pleasure zone is rocked. She smiles at his first Is your mind racing? evaporated...but that there are remnants still standing waiting to fall. It feels pretty good. responsibilities have entered your brain. Don't hide that from me. And really, one large reason we are here is because you respect me as a mother and I respect you as a father.. is looking at her...she is disconcerted. looks at him..they kiss...tenderness..heat...intimacy. say I want to take any man who wants me to the park and I will tell whether I want him from the way he is with Cristina. I wish you had been in the park then. Any reaction? considering and then the answer comes to him. you...Oh, there's no point. I talk too much... ...because I don't know if we ever talk again. Wait. Look at us - I think I call it honesty. FLOR let our hearts go back in our bodies, see each other a few more times. Make a tragedy out of us.. She kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a
Ahhhhhhh.	There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have kids...Please, are you ready to go? No. I'm not. No. Stay put for a second. Stay here. Once our feet touch that floor, I'm going to get too many brain cells back. So don't be in such a hurry. That floor, Flor, is going to eat us alive. So you think it was a mistake up to now. That's rough. She nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot on the cell. EVELYN think. You are enjoying it?!? I am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter. I am enjoying the fact that I really know how to advise you and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling up everything I say. nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a There's one thing I'd like to say to you about you and me. You were an alcoholic and wildly promiscuous woman during my formative years so that I am in this fix because of you. It is your fault. I just needed.. ..that moment for us. right now the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you. moves to her. everything.. shakes her head "no." Yes!
Do you know that right now you are	your own worst enemy..that you can't trust one thought in your brain?
Then trust me and only allow	yourself to say one thing to him..One thing..."I'm so glad you're back." But I've got to know whether he touched her - where he touched her - how he touched her - if they broke a sweat --- what they said - who made the first move - how they left it -- if anyone loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future - what she wore - how he felt afterwards - whether anyone mentioned me.. ..whether they held hands when they left.. distinct sound of a door opening and closing from EVELYN want a prayer of coming out of this. I forgot the sentence you said I should say. him. the time. It's fine that you look like that. It's genuine..You can use genuine. She takes a breath exits... DEBORAH
I'm so glad to see you	..that you're back. John looks up at her - not knowing what to say...he is The wrong words start to form..she stops herself.. said.. She is on the stairway..he turns to go in the opposite Uhhhh.. He turns back to her...she stops herself from straying into I can't sleep upstairs with you.. Just can't for now. This rocks her..panicked she grabs at her life preserver. Deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest She nods..then goes back up the stairs..
I am literally choking on unsaid	words..seriously. If this were a restaurant ten people would have their knuckles in my sternum. EVELYN
The fact that you didn't just make	things worse should fill you with hope.. In her current state, she has to process that one..and does. think we can jam anything else in. He springs from the bed and opens the door. were back and okay and all. Because?

I really appreciate it, Dad. Thanks....Stop staring at me..what? You don't know what to say? welcome. They kiss. leave right away? The others call greetings..save Evelyn who studies the FLOR

There are no monsters. climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted I can't believe you didn't get out. I don't want to get you wet. Thanks. hugs her. Evelyn hugs Cristina.. You're a beauty. Amazing girl. rub off on me.. I'm sorry you're so sad but this could have been so much worse. How? And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but Why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to Deborah? Flor flashes a look of thanks. Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances other at school..I'm going to keep an eye on you..I will. Flor enters the house... DEBORAH
Please stick your head in here for	a minute. Flor nods and starts up the stairs... horrible person? As Flor just looks at her. but sometimes I'm ridi... question. Complicated. I was just thinking to answer. close? No. Well, I'm very, very disappointed to hear that. It makes me feel like a fool. We weren't close..but we were connected...in a bad way. You know something, I think we're saying the same thing...Look as long as we're doing closure..What did you and my husband, John, do last night? Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined. DEBORAH I became sure of what an incredibly lucky woman you are and I must make myself not envy you which is hard. No, it's not hard. It's impossible. Now please..I am exhausted. Deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture Can't give you guys a lift? Flor shakes her head "no." She looks away for a beat so the Incredibly hard. The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful Let her have it..party favors. sorry we will not see each other as frequently. She offers her hand, which John shakes while patting her on They turn and begin walking down the street. mother told me that I would no longer go to the private school. to forgive you..It will be the end. I won't let you. And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops
My mother changed our lives once	more. This time because she saw in me, to her great alarm, a character flaw of some size. She has taught me to be a watch dog of my character, to control my ambition. I am not quite there.
For that reason should you choose	to grant me your scholarship my mother, at my request, will be relocating to the New York Metropolitan Area so that she can stay close during my time at Princeton. Cristina moves closer to Flor, who senses it immediately and justice. I love her with all my heart.
