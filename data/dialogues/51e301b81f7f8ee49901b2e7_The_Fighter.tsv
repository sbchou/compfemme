MICKY	It was huge. People still talk about it to this day. It was a great fight.
ALICE	Tonight my son is gonna surprise everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard. Believe it, I know it. Micky and Sugar Ray are described over HBO clips.
ALICE	It's true! Sugar Ray had a hard time hitting Dickie, didn't really knock him down, but Dicky knocked Ray down! I wore a new white dress.

DICKY (CONT'D)	You deserve the best, Micky, you have a chance to go all the way and I'm ready to be there for ya. Charlene and O'Keefe look upset. Awkward, everyone looking at Micky goes into the locker room. I can't tell ya how good it is to be back.
MICKY	You look good, your eyes are clear.
DICKY	I look good, right? Alice said lock up mighta been the best thing to happen to me. I got clean. I got clear up here (taps his head).
MICKY	That's beautiful, Dick. There's somethin' we gotta talk about.
DICKY	Hold on, I wanted to say' I been waitin' for this day, Micky, I been waitin' the whole time I was away. It kept me goin', it kept me alive, the idea of us workin' togethah again. Micky looks at him, nods. It's breaking his heart.
MICKY	I made a promise to them that I wouldn't work with you again. Dicky takes this in. Stunned.
DICKY	Ever?
MICKY	I had to. After everything that happened. I'm sorry. Dicky is hurt, stunned.
DICKY	The whole time I was away --
MICKY	I'm glad you're back, I'm glad you're doing good, I don't know what else to say. Micky, tears in his eyes, stares at Dicky a moment, nods, O'Keefe looks unsure as he holds the mits. Micky's about to Dicky walks back into the gym as Micky is about to work out
ALICE	What happened?
DICKY	He says I can't work with him.
ALICE	That's not right. [Dicky starts to leave] He never woulda won Sanchez without me!
MICKEY O'KEEFE	That's fuckin' bullshit! Take that back!
DICKY	Don't talk to my mother my mother like that.
ALICE	Why don't you ask Micky?
MICKEY O'KEEFE	They gotta go. If we're gonna train.
CHARLENE	They have to go, Micky.
ALICE	Why don't you ask Micky if he woulda won Sanchez without Dicky? Ask him. They all look at Micky. He is torn up over this as he
MICKY	I wouldn'ta won Sanchez without Dicky.
CHARLENE	How can you say that to O'Keefe?
MICKY	Because it's true. I went in with our plan and it wasn't working, I switched to what I learned with Dicky. Micky looks at O'Keefe, who is hurt. I wouldn'ta won it without you, either, O'Keefe, you know that.
CHARLENE	You got the focus and confidence from O'Keefe and Sal and your father and me!
ALICE	You were lucky to win that fight, Dicky saved him!
CHARLENE	We saved him! Dickya junkbag!
DICKY	Fuck you, Charlene, I'm 8 months sober.
CHARLENE	I'm sure you'll need somethin' for your back now that you're out.
DICKY	O'Keefe's in the same boat I am, one day at a time, why's it all right for him to be here, but not me? I'm blood.
MICKY	I'm the one fighting, not you, not you, and not YOU. I know what I need. And you need Dicky? Micky roils as he makes this decision.
MICKY	I want Dicky back. And I want you, Charlene, and I want O'Keefe, and my family.
CHARLENE	You can't do that to us.
MICKY	You sound like them now.
CHARLENE	Maybe you're just like them and that's where you belong. She looks at him, turns and walks out of the gym, followed by
ALICE	Everything happens for a reason, this could be for the best, honey. Micky watches Dicky get geared up with gloves, headgear, Alice's eyes glow.
RAY RAMALHO	Dicky Ecklund, the pride a Lowell! This rankles Micky as he and Dicky square off.
DICKY	I was trainin' in jail, so I'm ready. The two brothers spar, falling right back into it as Alice, And Micky comes over the top with a straight right off the Daddy, Daddy!
ALICE	Alice, take him home. [Little Alice leaves with Little Dicky]. What're you doin', Micky? What's the matter with you!
MICKY	Can this be my fight, for once, Alice, huh, just once, maybe just this one time, not for Dicky? I know you think he's comin' back, he's 40 years old and doesn't have a tooth in his head that's his own-- I can go ten more rounds, let's go-
ALICE	Let your brother talk.
DICKY	I'm Shea Neary, let's go, I'm Shea Neary, how ya gonna work me?
MICKY	Shut up!
DICKY	Shea Neary --
MICKY	Shut up! Dicky, hurt, stops.
DICKY	I'm the one who has this fight, this is my chance for a title, and I won't get another one after this. Am I being selfish? Am I saying Micky, Micky, Micky? I'm sorry, I thought I was fighting for a championship. He throws his gear off and starts to go when she runs to him,
ALICE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I didn't know what I was doing, I don't know why I did what I did, I did the best I could, I'll do better, I don't want to hurt you, Micky, I love you so much. As she holds him, Micky looks frustrated, but tears up in
GEORGE	Come on back--
DICKY	No, I gotta take care a something.
GEORGE	Micky wants you, I want you.
DICKY	Do ya, Georgie?
GEORGE	We gotta do this for Micky, come on. You're my son, too, Dick. Come on.
DICKY	You're my poppa, George.
DICKY	I gotta take care a something. He takes off, leaving George behind. I know what that means, don't do it, Dick. Come back. But Dicky keeps going. George watches, sad.
BOOBOO, WOLFIE, KAREN	Dicky's back! Hey, Dicky! Dicky limps toward them, slows down, looks at BooBoo, the Charlene, it's Dicky.
CHARLENE	Get off my porch, you piece of shit. Dicky presses the buzzer and won't stop.
CHARLENE	You fuckin' asshole!

CHARLENE	Really? What makes ya say that?
DICKY	I got no use for you eithah, but my bruthah loves ya and ya can't walk away 'cause a me. He don't deserve that. If you want me to quit, I'll quit.
CHARLENE	You're full a shit.
DICKY	Sweah to God, I'll quit if it makes you go back. Micky's got a chance to do somethin' I nevah did - Oh, the Sugah Ray Leonahd fight was my chance, I was great, I fought Sugah Ray Leonahd---
DICKY	Fuck you, Charlene. I came here to make things right -
CHARLENE	OK, let's make things right, numbah one: Ya didn't knock down Sugah Ray Leonahd, he tripped. I was in the fuckin' ring with 'im, Chalene, don't you think I know what happened? But I went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard, what the fuck have you evah done? Is your life so great? She doesn't say anything.
DICKY	Your eyes are red, you're hung ovah, don't tell me you're not. Ya life sucks.
CHARLENE	Maybe, the part without Micky sucks. Maybe I never did anything special like you, but I love Micky and I want him to have his chance.
DICKY	Then leave me alone. He needs me, you heard him, and I know he needs you, so let's spare him the bullshit from either one of us. She looks at him. Nods grudgingly.
CHARLENE	OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner, otherwise go fuck yourself. Dicky nods, walks off the porch. - What the hell are you doin' here?
DICKY	We worked it out fah you. Ask her. It's all together. Micky looks up and sees Charlene standing in the door. She
MICKY	Good. Get O'Keefe back, too.
DICKY	Micky nods, heads toward Charlene.
DICKY	- hey, Mick, you think I knocked down Sugah Ray Leonahd? Micky pauses, looks at his brother, says nothing.
MICKY	You went ten rounds, and he never hurt you. You were my hero.
DICKY	I was... He walks away.
MICKY	Do you want a ride home?
