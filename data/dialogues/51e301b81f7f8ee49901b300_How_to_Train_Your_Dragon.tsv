CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
Final Draft	
HICCUP (V.O.)	This, is Berk. It's twelve days North of hopeless, and a few degrees South of freezing to death. It's located solidly on the meridian of misery. The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	My village. In a word, sturdy. And it's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new. The camera drifts closer, circling.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitos. We have... Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is
HICCUP	...dragons.
HICCUP (V.O.)	Most people would leave. Not us. We're Vikings. We have stubbornness issues. Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	My name's Hiccup. Great name, I know. But it's not the worst. Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls. Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that. Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the Arggghhhhh! Mornin'! Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic
HICCUP (V.O.)	Meet the neighbors. Hoark the Haggard...
HOARK	What are you doing out!?
HICCUP	... Burnthair the Broad...
BURNTHAIR	Get inside!
HICCUP	... Phlegma the Fierce...
PHLEGMA THE FIERCE	Get back inside!
HICCUP	. Ack. He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yep, just Ack. Enter STOICK, the biggest Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from
STOICK	Hiccup!? What is he doing out again?! What are you doing out?! Get inside! The flames light up his scowling face and matted red beard. That's Stoick the Vast. Chief of the tribe. They say that when he was a baby he popped a dragon's head clean off of its shoulders. Do I believe it? Stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it, knocking the Yes I do. An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to DUCK. Stoick stands firm,
STOICK	What have we got?
VIKING #1	Gronkles. Nadders. Zipplebacks. Oh, and Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.
STOICK	Any Night Furies?
VIKING #1	None so far. Good.
VIKING	Hoist the torches! Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the
GOBBER	Ah! Nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off. Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
HICCUP	Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too muscular for their taste. They wouldn't know what to do with all this. Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.
GOBBER	They need toothpicks, don't they? Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
HICCUP (V.O.)	The meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber. I've been his apprentice ever since I was little. Well...littler.
STOICK	We move to the lower defenses. We'll counter-attack with the catapults.
HICCUP (V.O.)	See? Old village. Lots and lots of new houses. In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza -- Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her.
HICCUP (V.O.)	Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout. The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut. And... Astrid. A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her in a
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Their job is so much cooler. Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark.
GOBBER	Oh, you've made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.
HICCUP	Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date.
GOBBER	You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe... Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).
GOBBER (CONT'D)	... you can't even throw one of these. A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it
HICCUP	Okay fine, but... He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a ... this will throw it for me. Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up,
VIKING	Arggh!
GOBBER	See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.
HICCUP	Mild calibration issue.
GOBBER	Hiccup. If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons, you need to stop all... Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	... this. But... you just pointed to all of me.
GOBBER	Yes! That's it! Stop being all of you. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 7. Ohhhh... Ohhhhh, yes.
HICCUP	You, sir, are playing a dangerous game. Keeping this much, raw...Vikingness contained. There will be consequences! Gobber tosses him a sword.
GOBBER	I'll take my chances. Sword. Sharpen. Now. Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding One day I'll get out there. Because killing a dragon is everything around here.
HICCUP (V.O.)	A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed. The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Gronckles are tough. Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend. A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop,
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two heads, twice the status. A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM! It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT
CATAPULT OPERATOR	They found the sheep! Concentrate fire over the lower bank!
CATAPULT OPERATOR	Fire! Boulders are catapulted at the corralling Nadders...
HICCUP (V.O.)	And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go after those. They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire. It emerges from the flames, climbing the catapult with a
STOICK	Reload! I'll take care of this. Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer.
HICCUP (V.O.)	But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one has ever seen. We call it the-- "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 9.
VIKING	Night Fury! Get down! Vikings everywhere take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS. KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit by an artillery
HICCUP (V.O.)	This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and... The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in flames.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	...never misses. No one has ever killed a Night Fury. That's why I'm going to be the first.
IN THE STALL	Gobber trades his hammer for an axe.
GOBBER	Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me out there! Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Stay. Put. There. You know what I mean. Gobber charges into the fray, HOLLERING.
VIKING #6 (O.S.)	Hiccup, where are you going!
VIKING #7	Come back here!
HICCUP	I know. Be right back!
ON THE PLAIN BELOW	The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The
STOICK	Mind yourselves! The devils still have some juice in them. Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on Come on. Give me something to shoot at, give me something to shoot at. KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did anybody see that? Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Except for you. ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.
STOICK	DO NOT let them escape!
IN THE PLAZA	Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape. You're all out. He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know...
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Sorry, dad. Okay, but I hit a Night Fury. Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and
HICCUP (CONT'D)	It's not like the last few times, Dad. I mean I really actually hit it. You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot. It went down, just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there, before it--
STOICK	--STOP! Just....stop. He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring
STOICK (CONT'D)	Every time you step outside, disaster follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter's almost here and I have an entire village to feed! Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him.
HICCUP	Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think? A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously.
STOICK	This isn't a joke, Hiccup! Why can't you follow the simplest orders?
HICCUP	I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, you know? It's who I am, Dad.
STOICK	You are many things, Hiccup. But a dragon killer is not one of them. Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement.
STOICK (CONT'D)	Get back to the house. Make sure he gets there. I have his mess to clean up. Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction.
TUFFNUT	Quite the performance.
SNOTLOUT	I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped!
HICCUP	Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so... Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large
HICCUP (CONT'D)	I really did hit one.
GOBBER	Sure, Hiccup.
HICCUP	He never listens.
GOBBER	Well, it runs in the family.
HICCUP	And when he does, it's always with this... disappointed scowl. Like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich. Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring. I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side. This here. This is a talking fish bone.
GOBBER	You're thinking about this all wrong. It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand. Beat.
HICCUP	Thank you, for summing that up. They reach the doorway.
GOBBER	Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not. Hiccup SIGHS heavily.
HICCUP	I just want to be one of you guys. Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the
STOICK	Either we finish them or they'll finish us! It's the only way we'll be rid of them! If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave. They'll find another home.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 15.	LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade One more search. Before the ice sets in.
VIKING	Those ships never come back. We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. Now who's with me? Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts Today's not good for me. I've gotta do my axe returns.
STOICK	Alright. Those who stay will look after Hiccup. Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic
PHLEGMA THE FIERCE	To the ships!
SPITELOUT	I'm with you Stoick! That's more like it. The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick
GOBBER	I'll pack my undies.
STOICK	No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits.
GOBBER	Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy, Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...what could possibly go wrong? Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened.
STOICK	What am I going to do with him Gobber?
GOBBER	Put him in training with the others.
STOICK	No, I'm serious.
GOBBER	So am I. Stoick turns to him, glaring.
STOICK	He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.
GOBBER	Oh, you don't know that.
STOICK	I do know that, actually.
GOBBER	No, you don't.
STOICK	No, actually I do.
GOBBER	No you don't!
STOICK	Listen! You know what he's like. From the time he could crawl he's been...different. He doesn't listen.
STOICK (CONT'D)	Has the attention span of a sparrow. I take him fishing and he goes hunting for... for trolls. Trolls exist! They steal your socks. But only the left ones. What's with that?
STOICK	When I was a boy... Oh here we go.
STOICK	My father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it. I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him. And you know what happened?
GOBBER	You got a headache.
STOICK	That rock split in two. It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber. He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas! Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become. Hiccup is not that boy.
GOBBER	You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him. Look, I know it seems hopeless. But the truth is you won't always be around to protect him. He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now. ON STOICK, as Gobber's words hit their mark. Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly. He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil
HICCUP	Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people lose their knife or their mug. No, not me. I manage to lose an entire dragon. Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him, He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail Oh wow. I did it. I did it. This fixes everything. Yes! He strikes a victory pose, planting his foot on the fallen
HICCUP (CONT'D)	I have brought down this mighty beast! It suddenly shifts.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Whoa! Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it. As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with
HICCUP (CONT'D)	I'm going to kill you, Dragon. I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father. I'm a Viking. I am a VIKING! Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove his Viking- Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger He looks over the dragon's chaffed rope wounds.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	I did this. He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon, Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that Hiccup tries to sneak past, up the stairs to his room. Stoick
STOICK	Hiccup. Dad. Uh... Stoick stands, takes a deep breath.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	I, uh... I have to talk to you, Dad.
STOICK	I need to speak with you too, son. Hiccup and Stoick STRAIGHTEN at the same moment.
HICCUP STOICK	I've decided I don't want to I think it's time you learn What? What?
STOICK (CONT'D)	You go first.
HICCUP	No, you go first.
STOICK	Alright. You get your wish. Dragon training. You start in the morning. Oh man, I should've gone first. Uh, 'cause I was thinking, you know we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making Vikings, or small home
STOICK	Stoick hands Hiccup his axe. Hiccup avoids taking it.
HICCUP	I don't want to fight dragons.
STOICK	Come on. Yes, you do.
HICCUP	Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.
STOICK	But you will kill dragons.
HICCUP	No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.
STOICK	It's time Hiccup.
HICCUP	Can you not hear me?
STOICK	This is serious son! Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags
STOICK (CONT'D)	When you carry this axe... you carry all of us with you. Which means you walk like us. You talk like us. You think like us. No more of... ... this.
HICCUP	You just gestured to all of me.
STOICK	Deal?
HICCUP	This conversation is feeling very one-sided. Hiccup glances at the axe in his hands. It's a no-win Deal. Satisfied, Stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag... and
STOICK	Good. Train hard. I'll be back. Probably.
HICCUP	And I'll be here. Maybe. Stoick heads out the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe.
GOBBER	Welcome to dragon training! The recruits file through the gate, and out onto the arena
ASTRID	No turning back.
TUFFNUT	I hope I get some serious burns.
RUFFNUT	I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or lower back.
ASTRID	Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it. Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love it. The recruits turn to see Hiccup behind them. Groans all
TUFFNUT	Oh great. Who let him in?
GOBBER	Let's get started! The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
SNOTLOUT	Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him or...? The recruits LAUGH and chatter in the background.
TUFFNUT	Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings? Gobber throws a supportive arm around Hiccup and ushers him
GOBBER	Don't worry. You're small and you're weak. That'll make you less of a target. They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Viking-like teens instead. GOBBER stick him in line with the others and continues on
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight. Fishlegs bounces and giggles with excitement, barely able to
GOBBER (CONT'D)	The Deadly Nadder.
FISHLEGS	Speed eight. Armor sixteen.
GOBBER	The Hideous Zippleback.
FISHLEGS	Plus eleven stealth. Times two.
GOBBER	The Monstrous Nightmare.
FISHLEGS	Firepower fifteen.
GOBBER	The Terrible Terror.
FISHLEGS	Attack eight. Venom twelve. And...the Gronckle.
FISHLEGS	Jaw strength, eight. Gobber pulls a lever, raising the cross beam on the last of
SNOTLOUT	Whoa, wait! Aren't you gonna teach us first!?
GOBBER	I believe in learning on the job. BAM! A GRONCKLE thunders out of its cave, charging into the The recruits scramble in every direction. Except for Ruffnut
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Today is about survival. If you get blasted, you're dead. Quick, what's the first thing you're going to need?
HICCUP	A doctor?
FISHLEGS	Plus five speed?
ASTRID	A shield.
GOBBER	Shields. Go. The recruits scramble for shields, finding them scattered
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Your most important piece of equipment is your shield. If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield, take the shield. Hiccup STRUGGLES to lift his. Gobber helps him and sends him Ruff and Tuff stand amidst a dozen shields. But only one has
TUFFNUT	Get your hands off my shield!
RUFFNUT	There are like a million shields!
TUFFNUT	Take that one, it has a flower on it. Girls like flowers. Ruffnut uses the shield to BASH Tuffnut in the face. He
RUFFNUT	Ooops, now this one has blood on it. The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The
GOBBER	Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you're out! What?! What?! The Gronckle scoops up a pile of rocks and SWALLOWS them
GOBBER	Those shields are good for another thing. Noise. Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim. The kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their
GOBBER (CONT'D)	All dragons have a limited number of shots. How many does a Gronckle have?
SNOTLOUT	Five!
FISHLEGS	No, six.
GOBBER	Correct, six. That's one for each of you!
FISHLEGS	I really don't think my parents BAM! Fishlegs has his shield blasted away.
GOBBER	Fishlegs, out. Gobber spots Hiccup hiding from the Gronckle's molten slugs.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Hiccup, get in there! ON ASTRID bouncing on her heels, ready to dodge a blast.
SNOTLOUT	So anyway I'm moving into my parents' basement. You should come by sometime to work out. You look like you work out-- She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past
GOBBER	Snotlout! You're done! Astrid ROLLS to a stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly, So, I guess it's just you and me huh? "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 27.
ASTRID	No. Just you. Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks
GOBBER	One shot left! Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him, Hiccup! The Gronckle drives straight toward Hiccup, pinning him Gobber lunges in and hooks the Gronckle's mouth at the last
GOBBER (CONT'D)	And that's six! Gobber wrestles the irate Gronckle back into his pen.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Go back to bed, ya overgrown sausage! You'll get another chance, don't you worry. Slam! Lock. Gobber turns to the recruits.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Remember... a dragon will always, always go for the kill. He hoists Hiccup to his feet and walks off. Hiccup looks So...why didn't you? He drops the bola and presses on in the direction it flew
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Well this was stupid. SUDDENLY, the NIGHT FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils, Hiccup grins, excited to see it again, and slips closer. The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb out of Why don't you just...fly away? ON HICCUP as he spots the problem. He adjusts his drawing, The Night Fury raises his head, spotting Hiccup. They
GOBBER (O.S.)	Alright. Where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today? The recruits are seated at a table, eating dinner by the glow
ASTRID	I mistimed my summersault dive. It was sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble. Eye rolls from the group. Yeah. We noticed.
SNOTLOUT	No, no, you were great. That was so 'Astrid'.
GOBBER	She's right, you have to be tough on yourselves. CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall,
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Where did Hiccup go wrong? He tries to take a seat at the table...
RUFFNUT	He showed up.
TUFFNUT	He didn't get eaten. ... but the recruits keep closing the gaps. Rolling his eyes,
ASTRID	He's never where he should be.
GOBBER	Thank you, Astrid. Gobber stands. You need to live and breathe this stuff. Gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	The dragon manual. Everything we know about every dragon we know of.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	No attacks tonight. Study up. Gobber EXITS into the storm, leaving the teens staring at the
TUFFNUT	Wait, you mean read?
RUFFNUT	While we're still alive?
SNOTLOUT	Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
FISHLEGS	Oh! I've read it like, seven times. There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one that buries itself for like a week... The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long.
TUFFNUT	Yeah, that sounds great. There was a chance I was going to read that...
RUFFNUT	...but now... Snotlout gets up to go.
SNOTLOUT	You guys read, I'll go kill stuff. The others follow, with Fishlegs in tow.
FISHLEGS	Oh and there's this other one that has these spines that look like trees... Astrid is the last to go.
HICCUP	So I guess we'll share--
ASTRID	Read it. She pushes it toward him and leaves.
HICCUP	All mine then. Wow, so okay. I'll
SEE YOU--	Slam.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Tomorrow. OPENING the massive book. Thunder BOOMS outside. The hall is Hiccup pours through page after page of strange and
HICCUP (V.O.)	Dragon classifications. Strike class. Fear class. Mystery class. Hiccup turns the page.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	When startled, the Thunderdrum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range. Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. Hiccup's eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor sharp wings that can slice through full grown trees...extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. The illustrations seem to take on a life of their own,
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim. Extremely dangerous. The storm outside rages against the shuttered windows. Hiccup
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight. He begins flipping through the pages. A blur of dragons...
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill. Bone Knapper. Whispering Death. Burns its victims. Buries its victims. Chokes its victims. Turns its victims inside-out. Extremely dangerous. Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. Kill on sight. Kill on sight... Hiccup finally lands upon the page he's been looking for.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Night Fury. It's BLANK -- no image, save for a few, sparse details.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Speed unknown. Size unknown. The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Never engage this dragon. Your only chance, hide and pray it does not find you. Hiccup pulls his sketchbook out of his vest and opens it to CLOSE ON the drawing of Toothless... Stoick hovers over the familiar nautical map -- his eyes on
STOICK	I can almost smell them. They're close. Steady. Stoick raises his gaze to... AN EPIC FOG BANK, towering from sky to sea like a bruised, ON DECK the crewmen mill nervously, all too aware of what
STOICK (CONT'D)	Take us in. The helmsman steers Stoick's ship into the fog. The men draw
VIKING	Hard to port... for Helheim's gate. The first ship disappears into the whiteout, followed by the
HICCUP	You know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies. Is there another book? Or a sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet? KABLAM! A blast takes the axe head off of Hiccup's hilt,
GOBBER (O.S.)	FOCUS Hiccup! You're not even trying. Today... is all about attack. The Nadder hops from wall to wall, sending the recruits
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Nadders are quick and light on their feet. Your job is to be quicker and lighter. The teens move in, stumbling over Hiccup and his unwieldy
FISHLEGS	I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods.
GOBBER	Look for its blind spot. Every dragon has one. Find it, hide in it, and strike. Do you ever bathe?
TUFFNUT	If you don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.
RUFFNUT	How about I give you one! Ruff and Tuff SHOVE each other, till their movement and noise
GOBBER	Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so much. Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.
HICCUP	Hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
GOBBER	None one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale. Now get in there.
HICCUP	I know, I know, but hypothetically... Hiccup! She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to hide. Astrid somersaults into its blind spot, confusing it. She
SNOTLOUT	Watch out babe. I'll take care of this. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 36.
ASTRID	Hey! Snotlout MISSES. Astrid glares at him. The sun was in my eyes, Astrid. What do you want me to do, block out the sun? I could do that, but I don't have time right now! The Nadder tears off after her, knocking down walls in
HICCUP	They probably take the daytime off. You know, like a cat. Has anyone ever seen one napping?
GOBBER	Hiccup!
ASTRID	--Hiccup! Hiccup spins around to see the maze walls collapsing like
TUFFNUT	Oooh! Love on the battlefield!
RUFFNUT	She could do better. The Nadder closes in, emerging through the cloud of dust.
HICCUP	Just... let me... why don't you... The Nadder spins around and races back toward them like a Astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from
GOBBER	Well done, Astrid. Gobber hobbles off to wrestle the Nadder back into his cave.
ASTRID	Is this some kind of a joke to you? Our parents' war is about to become ours. Figure out which side you're on. She grabs her axe and stomps off. Hiccup watches, stung. A fish... being thrown into the cove. It hits the ground and Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it's missing
HICCUP	Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn you had... A set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the
HICCUP (CONT'D)	... teeth. The teeth retract again. Toothless presses closer with an expectant look. Hiccup Uh, no. No, I don't have any more. The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up. Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless CLOSE ON a sketch of Toothless. Hiccup draws with a stick, Toothless walks off. A moment later, he reappears with an Toothless snorts. Once again, they're face to face. Hiccup In a flash, the dragon is gone, leaving Hiccup astounded.
GOBBER	...and with one twist he took my hand and swallowed it whole. And I saw the look on his face. I was delicious. He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg.
FISHLEGS	Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon. Like if your mind was still in control of it you could have killed the dragon from the inside by crushing his heart or something.
SNOTLOUT	I swear I'm so angry right now. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot. I'll chop off the legs of every dragon I fight, with my face. He postures to Astrid. She rolls her eyes.
GOBBER	Un-unh. It's the wings and the tails you really want. If it can't fly, it can't get away. A downed dragon is a dead dragon. Alright. I'm off to bed. You should be too. Tomorrow we get into the big boys. Slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare. But who'll win the honor of killing it? He hobbles off. The teens reflect.
TUFFNUT	It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See? Tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a red dragon on his Your mom let you get a tattoo?
TUFFNUT	It's not a tattoo. It's a birthmark.
RUFFNUT	Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before.
TUFFNUT	Yes it was. You've just never seen me from the left side until now.
SNOTLOUT	It wasn't there yesterday. Is it a birthmark or a today-mark? Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group. Astrid watches With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal
CLOSE ON	... a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in
HICCUP	Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast. I hope you're hungry. Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Okay, that's disgusting. Toothless approaches, settling in to devour the feast.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Uh..we've got some salmon... Toothless swallows it.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	... some nice Icelandic cod... Swallows those too. ... and a whole smoked eel. Toothless nabs it, chews a few times, then spits it out. He
HICCUP (CONT'D)	No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I don't like eel much either. Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Okay. That's it. That's it, just stick with good stuff. And don't you mind me. I'll just be back...here. Minding my own business. Hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail, but every time
HICCUP (CONT'D)	It's okay. Hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail. Toothless' head juts Okay...okay.. The dragon tenses, slowly spreading his wings. Hiccup straps There. Not too bad. It works. Toothless BOLTS! He snaps his massive wings and takes to the
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Woah! No! No! No! Hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail. As the ground speeds Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition
HICCUP (CONT'D)	It's working! Toothless arcs just short of the water and climbs... high
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yes! Yes, I did it. He glances back at Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the He bounces across the water's surface and takes a dive. Hiccup resurfaces, roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yeah! Today is about teamwork. Work together and you might survive. ON A DOUBLE-WIDE DOOR. Gas seeps through the cracks.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire. The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky. One head breathes gas, the other head lights it. Your job is to know which is which.
FISHLEGS	Razor sharp, serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion. Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in its... Will you please stop that?
ON SNOTLOUT AND TUFFNUT	Moving nervously through the fog, back to back. Snotlout is
SNOTLOUT	If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna-- --There! Snotlout and Tuffnut HURL their water into the fog.
ASTRID	Hey!
RUFFNUT	It's us, idiots. Astrid and Ruffnut are soaked.
TUFFNUT	Your butts are getting bigger. We thought you were a dragon. Not that there's anything wrong with a dragon-esque figure. Astrid ELBOWS Snotlout in the face. Ruffnut DROPS Tuffnut
ASTRID	Wait. They FREEZE. A tail SWEEPS out of the fog, taking them down.
TUFFNUT	Oh, I'm hurt. I am very much hurt.
FISHLEGS	Chances of survival are dwindling into single digits now...
HICCUP	Look out! A Zippleback head emerges out of the smoke. Fishlegs hurls
FISHLEGS	Oh. Wrong head. GAS FLOWS around their legs. Fishlegs flees in a panic.
GOBBER	Fishlegs! Beat. A clicking sound comes from behind them. Sparks flash
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Now, Hiccup! The other head sweeps out of the smoke. Hiccup hurls his
HICCUP	Oh, come on! Gobber COVERS his eyes.
GOBBER (CONT'D)	Hiccup! Beat. The Zippleback hesitates. SNIFFS. Then retreats.
HICCUP	BACK! BACK! BACK! Now don't you make me tell you again! The Zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave,
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yes, that's right. Back into your cage. Hiccup slyly OPENS his vest, revealing the spotted smoked EEL Now think about what you've done. Hiccup turns to the teens and Gobber. They stare, slack-jawed
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Okay! So are we done? Because I've got some things I need to... Hiccup jogs out of the ring, past the speechless group.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yep...see you tomorrow. Astrid SNEERS. Something's going on.
HICCUP	Hey! "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 47.
HICCUP	Yeah! Whoa! Hiccup recovers to find Toothless still rolling around in the
FISHLEGS	Hey Hiccup, I've never seen a Gronkle to that before.
TUFFNUT	How'd you do that?
RUFFNUT	It was really cool. He squirms and invents an excuse.
HICCUP	I left my axe back in the ring. He turns and hurries back.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	You guys go on ahead and I'll catch up with you. Astrid watches, suspicious.
FISHLEGS	Hey Hiccup!
SNOTLOUT	What was that? Some kind of trick? What did you do?
TUFFNUT	Hiccup, you're totally going to come in first, there's no question.
GOBBER	Meet the Terrible Terror.
TUFFNUT	Ha. It's like the size of my-- Tuffnut is taken down in a blur.
TUFFNUT (CONT'D)	Get it off! Get it off! Oh! I'm hurt, I am very much hurt! Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch Wow, he's better than you ever were. She HUFFS, frustrated.
HICCUP	Oh, great.
VIKING	Hiccup. Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear,
ASTRID (O.S.)	Hiccup? Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically tries to pry the ring off
ASTRID (CONT'D)	Are you in there? Too late - she's right outside. ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith's.
HICCUP	Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid.
ASTRID	I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird. Well, weirder. Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As Gobber hobbles through the MUMBLING crowd to find Stoick --
VIKING	Where are the other ships?
SPITELOUT	You don't want to know. Stoick lumbers past Gobber, leaving him staring at the
GOBBER	Well, I trust you found the nest at least?
STOICK	Not even close.
GOBBER	Ah. Excellent. Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag
STOICK	I hope you had a little more success than me.
GOBBER	Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over with, then... yes. Stoick stops. What does that mean? A group of merry villagers rush past.
VIKING #1	Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so relieved.
VIKING #2	Out with the old and in with the new, right?!
VIKING #3	No one will miss that old nuisance!
VIKING #4	The village is throwing a party to celebrate! Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns
STOICK	He's... gone?
GOBBER	Yeah...most afternoons. But who can blame him? I mean the life of a celebrity is very rough. He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans. Stoick is doubly confused.
STOICK	Hiccup? Who would've thought, eh? He has this...way with the beasts.
HICCUP	Okay there bud, we're gonna take this nice and slow. Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Here we go. Here we go...position three, no four. He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Alright, it's go time. It's go time. They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Come on. Come on buddy. Come on buddy! They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yeah! Yes, it worked! The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Sorry. They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	My fault. Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four, no three. They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my... He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence. Hiccup grabs frantically for the airborne sheet...
HICCUP (CONT'D)	No!
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 54.	As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Oh gods! Oh no! Without Hiccup, the tail loses control. Hiccup and Toothless
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda angle yourself. No, no...come back down towards me. Come back down-- Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and a fireball.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Ah, come on.
HICCUP	Uh..no thanks. I'm good. Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and One grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away. Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Not so fireproof on the inside, are you? Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Here you go. The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and Everything we know about you guys is wrong.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 56.	
HICCUP	Dad! You're back! He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Gobber's not here, so... He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as
STOICK	I know. I came looking for you. You did? You've been keeping secrets. Hiccup's legs give out. He slides, dragging the table's
HICCUP	I...have?
STOICK	Just how long did you think you could hide it from me? I don't know what you're...
STOICK	Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.
HICCUP	Oh? "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 57.
STOICK	So. Let's talk about that dragon. Blood drains from Hiccup's face.
HICCUP	Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was going to tell you. I just didn't know how to-- Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	You're not...upset?
STOICK	What?! I was hoping for this!
HICCUP	Uh...you were?
STOICK	And believe me, it only gets better! Just wait til you spill a Nadder's guts for the first time. Hiccup's elated expression sinks.
STOICK (CONT'D)	And mount your first Gronckle head on a spear. What a feeling! Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him
STOICK (CONT'D)	You really had me going there, son. All those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was rough. I almost gave up on you! Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all.
STOICK (CONT'D)	And all the while, you were holding out on me! Thor almighty! Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in the ring, we finally have something to talk about. Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes nervously. Stoick After a long, uncomfortable silence...
STOICK (CONT'D)	Oh, I... brought you something. He presents a horned helmet.
STOICK (CONT'D)	To keep you safe in the ring. Wow. Thanks. Hiccup accepts it, looking it over.
STOICK	Your mother would've wanted you to have it. It's half of her breast plate. Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles.
STOICK (CONT'D)	Matching set. Keeps her close, y'know? Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing.
STOICK (CONT'D)	Wear it proudly. You deserve it. You've held up your end of the deal. Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN.
HICCUP	I should really get to bed.
STOICK HICCUP	Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house.
STOICK	Well..uh..good night. Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more Astrid ducks behind a barrier to find Hiccup already there.
ASTRID	Stay out of my way! I'm winning this thing.
HICCUP	Please, by all means. She darts off, CLOSING FAST on the dragon. The crowd above
VIKING IN CROWD	You got it Astrid! Hiccup stands and looks around. Amidst the crowd of Unbeknownst to Hiccup, the Gronckle spots him and makes a bee-
BACK TO ASTRID	... as she catches her breath behind a barrier. She scowls,
ASTRID	This time. This time for sure. Aaaaaaaaaa... And as she clears the barriers, she sees that Hiccup has
ASTRID (CONT'D)	...aaaaaaauGGGGGHHHHHHHH! No! No! Hiccup shrugs, as unhappy with the situation as she is. A loud CLACK ring out. From the crowd above, Gothi, the
STOICK	Wait! Wait!
HICCUP	So, later. Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave.
GOBBER	Not so fast.
HICCUP	I'm kinda late for-- What? Late for what exactly? Stoick holds out his hands to silence the jabbering crowd.
STOICK	Okay quiet down. The elder has decided. Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points
GOBBER	You've done it! You've done it, Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!
STOICK	Ha, ha! That's my boy! Hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits' shoulders and carried Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can't wait. I am so...
HICCUP	... leaving. We're leaving. Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation, forever. Toothless is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Oh..man... SHINK! Hiccup looks up to the sound of... Aggh! What the-- What are you doing here? She hops off the rock and back him down, spinning her axe
ASTRID	I want to know what's going on. No one just gets as good as you do. Especially you. Start talking! Are you training with someone?
HICCUP	Uh...training? She grabs him by his odd-looking harness.
ASTRID	It better not involve... this.
HICCUP	I know this looks really bad, but you see...this is, uh... They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the cove. You're right! You're right. I'm through with the lies. I've been making... outfits. So you got me. It's time everyone knew. Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go. He puts her hand back on his harness, getting her to 'drag AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do that?!
ASTRID	That's for the lies. Astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of Hiccup's laid-out
ASTRID (CONT'D)	And THAT'S for everything else. Hiccup's YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other Oh man. She dives onto Hiccup.
ASTRID	Get down! Run! Run! Astrid pulls her axe, ready to take on Toothless.
HICCUP	No!
HICCUP (CONT'D)	No. It's okay! It's okay... Toothless pulls up short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with She's a friend. Toothless snorts in disagreement. Astrid is frozen. Toothless You just scared him.
ASTRID	I scared him!? Hiccup makes a âbe quietâ motion. Who is him?
HICCUP.	Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid. Astrid backs away, eyeing Hiccup and Toothless together with
HICCUP	We're dead. Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away. Where do you think you're going?
ASTRID	Oh great Odin's ghost, this is it!
ASTRID (CONT'D)	Hiccup! Get me down from here!
HICCUP	You have to give me a chance to explain.
ASTRID	I'm not listening to ANYTHING you have to say!
HICCUP	Then I won't speak. Just let me show you. Hiccup extends a hand.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Please, Astrid. She eyes him and the dragon, then the ground far, far below.
ASTRID	Now get me down.
HICCUP	Toothless? Down. Gently. Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	See? Nothing to be afraid of. Toothless suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Toothless! What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon! He's not usually like this. Oh no... "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 65. Toothless rockets over the ocean waves, deliberately dipping Toothless, what are you doing?! We need her to like us! Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	And now the spinning. Thank you for nothing you useless reptile. Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.
ASTRID	Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just get me off of this thing. Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone. Satisfied, They level off and head up into the clouds. Astrid opens her Toothless rises above a blanket of clouds... Astrid tucks her arms into Hiccup's vest, burying her chin Toothless climbs past Berk's tallest peaks and heads out over
ASTRID	Alright I admit it. This is pretty cool. It's... amazing. He's amazing. Astrid carefully reaches down and pats Toothless' side.
ASTRID (CONT'D)	So what now? Hiccup groans. It's a problem without an answer.
ASTRID (CONT'D)	Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow. You know you're going to have to kill... ... kill a dragon.
HICCUP	Don't remind me. A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates Toothless! What's happening? What is it? Toothless BARKS at him. 'Quiet!' Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Get down! Hiccup and Astrid duck. The Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback
ASTRID	What's going on?
HICCUP	I don't know. Toothless. You've got to get us out of here, bud. Toothless HISSES. It looks like they're hauling in their kill. The Zippleback eyes them ravenously.
ASTRID	What does that make us? The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera, It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into
HICCUP	What my dad wouldn't give to find this. Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
ASTRID	They're not eating any of it. The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified. What is that? The monstrous beast SNIFFS the air, seemingly aware of them.
HICCUP	Alright buddy, we gotta get out of here. Now! Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of
ASTRID	No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive. They're the workers... and that's their queen. It controls them. She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.
ASTRID (CONT'D)	Let's find your dad.
HICCUP	No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill Toothless.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Astrid, we have to think this through carefully. Astrid eyes him, incredulous.
ASTRID	Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest...the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here. And you want to keep it a secret? To protect your pet dragon? Are you serious? Hiccup stands firm, resolute.
HICCUP	Yes. Astrid's taken aback.
ASTRID	Okay. Then what do we do?
HICCUP	Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.
ASTRID	Okay. Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm.
ASTRID (CONT'D)	That's for kidnapping me. Hiccup looks to Toothless for support. Toothless SNORTS, Astrid grabs him. He braces for another hit. She KISSES
ASTRID (CONT'D)	That's for, everything else. In the awkward wake of the moment, Astrid hurries off...
HICCUP	What are you looking at?
STOICK	Well, I can show my face in public again. If someone had told me that in a few short weeks, Hiccup would go from being, well... Hiccup, to placing first in dragon training... I would've tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad. Yes! And you know it! But here we are. And no one's more surprised... ON HICCUP standing at the entrance to the ring, listening,
STOICK (CONT'D)	... or more proud than I am. Today, my boy becomes a Viking. TODAY, HE CHEERS and ROARS. Astrid approaches Hiccup.
ASTRID	Be careful with that dragon.
HICCUP	It's not the dragon I'm worried about. What are you going to do?
HICCUP	Put an end to this. She eyes him, dubious.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	I have to try. Astrid. If something goes wrong... just make sure they don't find Toothless. I will. Just promise me it won't go wrong. Hiccup can't. Gobber approaches.
GOBBER	It's time, Hiccup. Knock him dead. Hiccup puts his helmet on and enters the ring. HOOTING and HOLLERING from the stands.
TUFFNUT	Show 'em how it's done, my man! Hiccup locks eyes with Stoick. Stoick nods with a smile. Hrmph. I would've gone for the hammer. Hiccup turns to face a bolted, heavy door. Takes a deep
HICCUP	I'm ready. The door bolt is raised. The crowd grows quiet... BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire. It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing The crowd grows silent, bracing for the big fight. ON STOICK, also confused.
STOICK	What is he doing? The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open It's okay. It's okay. The dragon continues to pace, focused on... HICCUP'S HELMET.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	I'm not one of them. GASPS and MURMURS race through the crowd.
STOICK	Stop the fight.
HICCUP	No. I need you all to see this. The crowd gets restless.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	They're not what we think they are. We don't have to kill them. The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden
ON TOOTHLESS	His ear plates shoot up. Panic flares in his eyes.
STOICK	Out of my way!
ASTRID	Hiccup! Astrid wedges her axe under the arena gate and squeezes
ASTRID	Hiccup! She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous
STOICK	This way! Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din.
GOBBER	Night Fury! Get down! Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry of The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and Alright, Toothless, go. Get out of here! The crowd is gob-smacked, growing livid.
VIKINGS	Night Fury!
HICCUP	Go! GO!
VIKING	Take it alive! Stoick grabs an axe and charges into the arena. Astrid calls
ASTRID	Stoick no!
HICCUP	Dad! No! He won't hurt you! The other Vikings surround and attack Toothless. He tosses
HICCUP (CONT'D)	No, don't! You're only making it worse! Stoick raises his hammer as he charges for Toothless.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Toothless! STOP! He pins Stoick and inhales. The familiar hiss of gas builds. Toothless swallows back the blast and turns to Hiccup, not
VIKING	Get him! The crowd rushes him, piling on, and taking Toothless down. No! Please...just don't hurt him. Please don't hurt him.
STOICK	Put it with the others! His burning glare turn to Hiccup.
ON HICCUP	Being shoved into the dank, dimmed hall.
STOICK	I should have known. I should have seen the signs.
HICCUP	Dad.
STOICK	We had a deal! Stoick pauses to say something, but stops short. He SNORTS I know we did... but that was before... ughh, it's all so messed up.
STOICK	So everything in the ring. A trick? A lie? He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting
HICCUP	I screwed up. I should have told you before now. Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please... just don't hurt Toothless.
STOICK	The dragon? That's what you're worried about? Not the people you almost killed?!
HICCUP	He was just protecting me! He's not dangerous.
STOICK	They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!
HICCUP	And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM! They defend themselves, that's all! They raid us because they have to! If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves. There's something else on their island dad...it's a dragon like-- Stoick HUFFS.
STOICK	--Their island? He stomps back... pointing an accusing finger.
STOICK (CONT'D)	So you've been to the nest.
HICCUP	Did I say nest? Hiccup goes silent -- he said too much.
STOICK	How did you find it?!
HICCUP	No... I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island. Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Oh no. No, Dad. No. Hiccup chases after him, panicked. Dad. It's not what you think. You don't know what you're up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen. He grabs Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Dad. Please. I promise you that you can't win this one. Nothing.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	No. Dad. No. For once in your life, He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to the floor.
STOICK	You've thrown your lot in with them. You're not a Viking. You're not my son. Stoick pushes through the door, leaving Hiccup alone, Ready the ships! Below on the docks, Vikings load the heavy artillery into the Lastly, Toothless is loaded aboard Stoick's ship, chained
STOICK	Set sail! We head for Helheim's Gate. He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side
STOICK (CONT'D)	Lead us home, Devil.
ON HICCUP	Watching. He's powerless to stop what is happening, but won't
ON HICCUP	Still standing there. The ships have cleared the horizon.
ASTRID	It's a mess. Hiccup doesn't respond. You must feel horrible. You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.
HICCUP	Thank you for summing that up.
HICCUP (CONT'D)	Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods. It would have been better for everyone.
ASTRID	Yep. The rest of us would have done it. So why didn't you? Hiccup just shakes his head - he really doesn't know.
ASTRID (CONT'D)	Why didn't you?
HICCUP	I don't know. I couldn't.
ASTRID	That's not an answer. Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?
ASTRID	Because I want to remember what you say right now.
HICCUP	Oh for the love of -- I was a coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.
ASTRID	You said 'wouldn't' that time. Whatever! I wouldn't! Three hundred years and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon!
ASTRID	First to ride one, though. Hiccup blinks. He never looked at it that way before.
ASTRID (CONT'D)	So... "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 81. ...I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was. I looked at him and I saw myself. Astrid turns to face the open sea.
ASTRID	I bet he's really frightened now. What are you going to do about it? Beat.
HICCUP	Probably something stupid.
ASTRID	Good. But you've already done that. Another beat.
HICCUP	Then something crazy. Astrid smiles.
ASTRID	That's more like it.
STOICK	Sound your positions. Stay within earshot. Shouts pour in from all directions.
VIKING #1	Here. "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 82.
VIKING #2	One length to your stern.
VIKING #3	On your starboard flank.
VIKING #4	Three widths to port.

GOBBER	Listen... Stoick... I was overhearing some of the men just now and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here -- not me of course, I know you're always the man with the plan -- but some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all, what it might be?
STOICK	Find the nest and take it.
GOBBER	Ah. Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fall-back. Nice and simple.

HICCUP	Relax. It's okay... it's okay. Hiccup turns and walks away.
SNOTLOUT	Where are you going?! Hiccup pulls a bundle of rope from a supply box.

STOICK	Gobber, go with the men.
GOBBER	I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy. Stoick grabs him. I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt. Gobber removes Stoick's hand. Clenches his forearm,
