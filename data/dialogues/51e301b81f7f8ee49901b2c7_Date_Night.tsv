CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
PHIL	Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles! he gives him a long, slow kiss.
PHIL (CONT ' D )	Minty fresh.
CLARA	That was nice.
PHIL	It was nice.
CLARA	Hey from now on when you change the toilet paper, could you just make sure it is out? Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's over!
CLARA	Oh, believe me, we're just getting started, Phil.
PHIL	Look at this one of your Mom with me. I mean that woman can't contain her 'Love! She just takes a while to warm up. You guys are gonna be best buddies. You picked a favorite of us yet? Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.
CLARA (CONT'D)	That's exactly the one I picked!
PHIL	Man, I wish I was them. Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades
CLARA	I just... when I was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this. Now they can't even acknowledge each other. Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.
CLARA (CONT'D)	Let's always remember to have some time that's just for the two of us. No matter what else comes up in our lives - if it's work or friends or when we have kids-
PHIL	We're having kids? With an "S"? OK fine. But I promise you it's never gonna happen to us.
CLARA	Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when I'm long in the tooth.
PHIL	You'll be even hotter long toothed. Right now to be honest Clara they're a little stumpy. Oh really? As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.
PHIL	wasn't the pictures.
CLARA	You know how long that took?
PHIL	We'll fix the picture piles, Clara. We've got all the time in the world. From now on everything's gonna be just about us. Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.
MOM!	The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks Mo-om! It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan
OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Mom! Mom! Mom!
CLARA	I'm coming, Ollie!
CLARA	Uh Phil? Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.
PHIL	Yep?
CLARA	I need to switch. I've got an open house. Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but
PHIL	Really?
CLARA	Yeah. Really. As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands
PHIL	OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable.
OLLIE	Yeah, well Mom says that. Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.
PHIL	Oh. Well... that's cool too!
CLARA	Ech. Mine. She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the
NT. KITCHEN	Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as
PHIL	What?
OLLIE	Breakfast? Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob today. What's it gonna be? Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign
OLLIE	How about... some Captain Crunch? Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.
OL	Captain Crunch?The cereal?
PHIL	Uh... yeah. Sure. Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
CLARA	Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a bowl yesterday.
IE	But Dad already said yeah sure. Clara glances at Phil. said it. I said it Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowl A week.
PHIL	One bowl a day a week. Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already
PHIL (CONT'D)	This is not for you today! Yeah right. Worth a try.
CLARA	Did you get his lunch together?
PHIL	Oh. Whoops. You just get his breakfast and I'll do it. As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but I'll be there as soon as I can.
PHIL	Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today. You know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that I don't
CLARA	Ollie, do you want a banana?
PHIL	Did you hear me?
CLARA	Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you don't understand. Banana Ollie? So I should probably get going. With the highway construction it takes forever to get downtown these days.
CLARA	OK. Have a good day. Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
CLL. -- (CONT ' D )	Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.
PHIL	Sorry for the milky mouth. He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1
CHAZ (O.S.)	Well, well! We're up bright and early, aren't we!
PHIL	Yes we are! ike you say to me every morning. Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
OW! OW! OW!	Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her
JANE	His name's Juan and he's some kind of Spanish, I think. He knows all these exclusive, underground places downtown. It's so exciting. And in bed... I never knew I could still get my leg back that far.
CLARA	Too much information, Jane. The divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me. Seriously. You know that great nervous feeling in your stomach? Where you don't know what's going to happen next? On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on With Larry, I lost that. Everything had just become routine, you know? Boring. Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through
JANE (CONT'D)	But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!
CLARA	Good for you, Jane. Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki
CLARA (CONT'D)	Good for you.
T. FRONT HALLWAY - A LITTLE L	Clara and Jane sit on the floor, together
JANE	There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we went to the ot__ar night that you guys would love. _"st amazing view of the city. You guys should check it out on your next date night.
CLARA	Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have those that much anymore.
JANE	't have date nights:
CLARA	You know, we're pretty tired all the time between work and Ollie. And some of the shows on TV these days are really great. Ah. I see. They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look
CLAM	I know that's really lame.
JANE	So it's Phil? No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us. I don't know. It just... happened.
JANE	So why don't you change it? All you have to do is stir things up and have one great, sexy, exciting night again.
CLARA	I guess. Maybe.
JANE	Not maybe. Tonight.
CLARA	Nah. Tonight's no good.
JANE	Why not? Seriously think about it. What's really gonna be more important tonight than that? Clara takes this in. Jane's right.
PHIL	I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on the highways is insane these days!
MR. RIVERS	Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine. Catch your breath. George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then
MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)	Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start... I've been thinking... this next quarter we need to venture into open tundra. Start really ripping the meat.
PHIL	Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a more high risk direction?
MR.	Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid. Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some higher risk options and come back tomorrow. OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want George to give me his thoughts on where we need to be hunting too.
PHIL	Oh.
MR. RIVERS	s nothing personal. So let me get this straight. You're telling me that tomorrow I'm going to have to interview for the job I already have? Against George?
MR. RIVERS	I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need our pack leader to be more like... like a momma kangaroo. Ya get me?
PHIL	Kinda. Actually, no. Not really at all.
MR. RIVERS	The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma's teat is just always there, ready to suckle. But at the same time, momma kangaroo's still a wild, dangerous creature.
PHIL	Sorry. Still not totally getting you.
MR. RIVERS	I've had a wife and a family. Three of them. It's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack, Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't have a family to worry about. He can rip the meat.
PHIL	Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to... I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still... in the jungle! What does that mean?
PHIL	I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just can't.
MR. RIVERS	Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little... well... tame. That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers! I'll see you tomorrow. Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.
SCHOOL	Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from
CLARA	So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our reservation's at 7:45. She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it. Mrs. Foster? Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned
CLARA	Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you later. Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a
CLARA (CONT'D)	I've been meaning to tell you that you can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.
MRS. CARDIGAN	I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries matter.
MRS. CARDIGAN	Can we speak a moment? Alone?
CLARA	Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car. As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.
CLARA (CONT'D)	Is everything OK?
MRS. CARDIGAN	Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately. Especially Jenny Diggs.
CLARA	Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's happening?
MRS. CARDIGAN	I'm going to leave that to you and your nd to figure out. But beyond that, ,i: overall attitude these days is just... sub par. E
MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)	His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks motivation and tries to just "get by" o assignments. You know, this is a very competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my opinion, maybe you should consider whether this is really the right environment for him.
CLARA	Uh... wow. OK. Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car,
CLARA (CONT'D)	Wow. What a bitch.
OLLIE	Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?
CLARA	No.
OL LIE	Yeah you did.
CLARA	I didn't. I really didn't. Clara quickly pulls out. Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full
PHIL	Unbelievable!
PHIL	Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta tell you it's about time. I'm going to Nana's tonight.
PHIL	On a school night? Why? Mom says you guys are going out.
PHIL	Tonight? What? No. Clara?
PHIL	Clara? Cl- He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an
PHIL (CONT'D)	Wow. Wow. Clara tns and smiles. I thought I could take you out to celebrate you finally getting that report in. A romantic dinner downtown like the old days, and teen... Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have the house all to ourselves. All night.
PHIL	Wow... It sounds... great.
CLARA	Great! She turns back and continues getting ready.
PHIL	It's just... is there any chance we coul take a rain check? A "rain check"?
PHIL	Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do a bit of work tonight. E
CLARA	I thought all the cramming was for this report today. Did something go wrong? Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just decided I could play with it a little more. Make it a little better. Clara takes him in a moment.
CLARA	Oh. OK. Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry
PHIL	Listen, I'm sorry...
CLARA	You don't need to apologize, Phil.
PHIL	Listen, if I had more warning-
E C	Then something else would have come up. You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We used to do things on the spur of the moment all the time. Even after Ollie was born. Now we never do anything together. They stare at each other, then Phil breaks
PHIL	Listen... any other night.
CLARA	OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get out of this and call my Mom then. As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her,
PHIL	That dress really wasn't playing fair, Clara. With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.
PHIL (CONT'D)	Well get a move on, girl! She zips her dress back up.
RUTH	Hey sweeties. Phil.
PHIL	Ruth.
RUTH	Nana rented us a special treat tonight before bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz!
PHIL,	Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don't you think that's a little scary for a 5 year old?
RUTH	No, Phil, I don't.
PHIL	OK... not so sure about that. Clara? What do you think?
RUTH	Yeah, Clara. What do you think?
CLARA	I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's doing us a favor tonight.
PHIL	fine. Fine. oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.
CLARA	You know, I should pee before we go. OK. Sure. As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in
PHIL (CONT'D)	I'll just wait in the car as you go back E inside to pee. Again. Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents.
PHIL	You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways to get reelected, but all everyone's going to remember when it's time to vote is all this mess.
CLARA	You're hot?
PHIL	Yeah. That's why I turned on the air. Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes AIR to You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today that Ollie's been antagonizing his daughter.
PHIL	Antagonizing? How does a five year old "antagonize?" I'm sure she wouldn't have mentioned it if it wasn't "the Mayor's daughter."
CL	She also went on that Ollie's penmanship's sloppy and he's not motivated enough.
PHIL	Got all my best traits, huh? He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,,
PHIL (CONT'D)	I think he's fine.
CLARA	She actually had the gall to suggest we should think about sending him somewhere else.
PHIL	Maybe she's right if the school has that kind of attitude. Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a
CL RA	You know what? All we ever end up talking about is Ollie or work. Let's just focus on us tonight. Great. I'm all for tha Beat. They sit in silence in the traffic.
CLARA	So what are you thinking about?
PHIL	Right now? Traffic.
CLARA	Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable story from Jane today.
PHIL	Yeah?
CLARA	She has this old classmate who went into labor with her second child the other day. She's totally healthy and everything's normal with the pregnancy. So she goes into labor and walks into the emergency room, and the second the nurses and attendants see her come in, they go
PHIL	What's AMA?
CLARA	Advanced Maternal Age! No! You've got to be joking me!
CLARA	kid you not!
PHIL	That's unbelievable!
CLARA	I know. Beat. Clara looks out the window.
CLARA (CONT'D)	The funny thing is she's my age, actually. Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible
PHIL	Huh.
E	Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's
PHIL (CONIT'B)	I thought you were cold.
CLARA	I was, but then you turned it down and I got hot.
PHIL	But I turned it down because... you see when you open and close your vents it makes my... never mind. Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping
CL AAA	What are you doing?
PHIL	I'm just gonna take a shortcut.
CLARA	Phil, please don't. You think they're shortcuts but they always take longer. And we're already-
PHIL	Clara, please just trust me, OK They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated,
PHIL	I promise you it wouldn't have been any faster. I promise! OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we're here? I'm gonna go pee.
PHIL	Now?
CLARA	What?
PHIL	Nothing. As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS	Good evening. Welcome to the Signature Room.
PHIL	Thanks. The name is Foster.
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS	Foster... Oh, I'm sorry. We just had give away your table.
PHIL	You gave away our table? We're just ten minutes late! Actually, you're 11 minutes late. OK. But don't you guys have, like, some kind of grace period or something?
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS	have an eight minute grace period.
PHIL	You have an eight minute grace period? How did you come up with an eight minute grace period? I just work here,
PHIL	So what if someone's 9 minutes late?
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS	We're allowed to give a two minute grace on the grace.
PHIL	OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're 11 minutes late. That's just one minute later than the grace on the grace.
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS	I'm sorry sir, but management specifically said no grace on the grace on the grace. After ten minutes, we send a host around calling your name and if there's no answer, we give the table away. Sorry.
PHIL	So how long's the wait for another table?
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS	Well, let's see... Phil looks on as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger
PHIL	Oh boy.
SLICK LOOKING MAN	We've gotta leave now. Whoops. Sorry.
CLARA	It's OK. The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the
CLARA	How lc= -until they seat us?
PHIL	Two hours. They gave away our reservation. Peanut?
CLARA	What?!? Did you tell them that we hit traffic?
PHIL	They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call your name at the bar and you don't answer, they give your table away. So how about a nut? A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar.
GALE PARTY?	Clara sighs, frustrated.
CLARA	I mean, did you try something like telling her it was our anniversary, or my birthday, or slipping her some money-
PHIL	Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the answer! Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST
PHIL	I'm sure if you had been there instead of peeing again you would have done it better.
PHIL	You're not even listening to me, are you?
CLARA	Yeah I am. You're sure if I had been there instead of peeing again I would have done it better. Clara, Just because you can repeat the words I say doesn't mean you're-
CLARA	Sorry! We're right here!
PHIL	Wait. What are you doing?
CLARA	Shhh! The Young Host approaches.
YOUNG HOST	Gale party of three?
CLARA	The third's running a little going to start without them.
YOUNG HOST	eat. Follow me. Phil shoots Clara a look, but she ignores it. He falls
YOUNG HOST	Enjoy your dinner. The Young, Host leaves.
CLARA	See? Was that so hard to do, Phil? bad to be the Gales, eh? Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the
CLARA (CONT'B)	Look Phil! It's white truffle season! I'm totally doing it!
PHIL	We can't do this, Clara.
CLARA	I'm taking you out.
PHIL	Not the truffles. This is stealing. Stealing? You're kidding, right.
PHIL	We're not the Gales.
CL ARA	So? You said yourself - if you don't answer at the bar they give your table away.
PHIL	Well, what if they show up now?
N CLAR 2	u get spanked'
PHIL	I'm serious! I don't know. What if they do, Phil? Clara picks up her menu and reads, shaking her head.
PHIL	What?
CLARA	It's just... I don't know. You used to be the one who would think up stuff like this all the time. This hits Phil. He takes in his wife reading the menu
PHIL	You know what? You're absolutely right. Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for
PHIL (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, Mrs. Gale. It's OK, Mr. Gale. And might I add you look very handsome tonight?
PHIL	You're not looking too shabby yours Mrs. Gale.
GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)	Mr. Gale? They turn, surprised, to see TWO BURLY MEN in suits at
OLDER BURLY MAN	We need to have a word with you both.
CLARA	What's this about?
OLDER BURLY MAN	k you know what this is about. you could please come with us.
PHIL N	Why can't we talk here? u
OLDER BURLY 'MAN	I think it would save everyone a lot of embarrassment. Please... The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara's chair to pull
WAITER	Can I help you? OLDER s _ ï¿½'LY MAN Nah. We're fine Â® Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man
PHIL	Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we going?
OLDER BURLY MAN	Get in, please. The Younger Burly Man coming up behind them crowds them
CLARA	Hey! Jesus! The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes
PHIL	Listen, this is all getting out of hand, OK? I admit we maybe did something a teeny bit wrong, but- Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS
E CLOSEUP ON PHIL'S NOSE	An AMMONIA STICK waves back and forth under Phil's nose
PHIL	Whoa. What the hell is this? Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older Phil?!? What's going on?
PHIL	I don't know. A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the table
SPEAKERPHONE	The chloroform may make you feel dizzy for a few moments, but it will go away.
U	Phil takes in what's going on, freaked.
PHIL	Listen... you can just have all our money, OK? Whatever's there, it's yours. We're not looking to cause problems or put up any kind fight. We'll just walk away and not report anything, OK? All we want is for you to let us go unharmed.
SPEAKERPHONE	We need to discuss your little stunt tonight first, Mr. and Mrs. "Gale." Or should we say... what is it Harry? HARRY, the Younger Burly Man reads Phil and Clara's IDs,
HARRY	Phil and Clara Foster. That's what this is abo
SPEAKERPHONE	else would it be about, Mr. Foster Wait. `'This a joke, right? Some funny little bald guy's gonna jump out and scare us and say, "Gotcha!" or somethi OK, where is he? Where's that guy?
SPEAKERPHONE	You think this is a joke? Phil looks at the faces of the two thugs. No one's No. Are you insane?!? You don't drug people and tie them up for that! This i I just- I hope you know this is gonna go way beyond a shitty review in Za I'm seriously pissed off!
SPEAKERPHONE	Yes. Well, I'm a little upset as well, Mr. Foster. And confused. It would help me to know why a couple like the two of you would try to pull something like this. Phil's now getting really annoyed.
PHIL	You must be kidding! Like a million people don't do it every single night of the week! This is unbelievable! I'm just in shock here! Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled.
SPEAKERPHONE	I enjoy your humor, Mr. Foster. Now why don't you start by telling me how you got into the Rainbow to set it uD-
PHIL	"Into the Rainbow?" What the hell's that? Restaurant code?
SPEAKERPHONE	-and then you can tell me where the photos are that you arranged to bring tonight.
PHIL	Photos? Clara figures out what's happened.
CLARA	Wait a minute. I think there's been a really big mistake here. We're not the Gales.
SPEAKERPHONE	know you're not the Gales.
PHIL	They know we're not the Gales. Don't you get it!
CLARA	No, Phil. I think they think we're actually "the Gales" who made the reservation tonight. Ohhhhhh. Oh. No. She's right. We're not those Gales. You've got the wrong people. Really.
SPEAKERPHONE	Then why were you two at the Gales' table, Mr. Foster?
PHIL	OK, listen, what happened is we lost our reservation and when the host came around yelling the Gales' name and no one answered, my wife said that we were them. I swear on my life to you that's what happened.
SPEAKEFP IC	You're saying you just took someone else's reservation you didn't know? That's what you want me to believe?
PHIL	I know that seems really weird. Listen, I agree, that's what I said to her.
FRANK	One problem with your story. When I came over to the table - and you guys were all alone - you were still calling each other Gale.
PHIL	That was just... we were... no, you don't understand...
SPEAKERPHONE	We'll need to move things along, Frank.
PHIL	Wait a minute. What's going on?
CLAW	I don't t don't like this. Clicking the loaded gun, Frank and Harry both come toward
SPEAKERPHONE	If in ten seconds you don't tell us where the photos are, you lose a knee, Mr. Foster. Ten more seconds, you lose another. Then we go to your wife.
PHIL	Please! You can't do this! We're not lying!
SPEAKERPHONE	One... two... three... four... Frank clicks the loaded gun at Phil's knee.
PHIL	Oh Jesus. Don't do it!
SPEAKERPHONE	Five... six... seven... eight...
PHIL	Jesus! Everyone looks over. Phil's surprised.
CLARA (CONT'D)	But we can't just tell you where they are. We have to take you to them.
FRANK	You drive with her in front. So what's your plan here? I don't have a plan Phil. You don't have a plan? No. I was just trying to keep our knees for the time being. Well, if we end up in that car with them we're as good as dead.
FRANK	Quiet! Well, any time you want to help... What's that supposed to mean?
FRANK	I said quiet! They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing
CLARA	Phil? He drops to the ground.
PHIL	Whoa.
CLARA	Phil? What is it?
PHIL	I'm... not feeling so great...
HARRY	's wrong with him? I don't know. I didn't... eat dinner and when I don't my blood sugar... Hypoglycemic...
CLARA	You're not hypoglycemic. Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OF You're diabetic! You never get the terms right, Phil! Oh no! This is bad, guys.
PHIL	I just can't... go any further. Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do.
HARRY	Should we call Mr. Stockton?
FRANK	Don't say his name, you idiot!
HARRY	Sorry! I was just-
FRANK	We'll just throw him in the back and have her show us. hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.
CLARA	Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar. If you give it to me I can find it for him. With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing Drop the gun and the keys.
PHIL	oa! Clara! No Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and Harry looks at him, confused.
HARRY	Ow! Why, man?
PHIL	Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.
HARRY	Why,
PHIL	ought that's what you do when-
CLARA	Phil! Just c'mon! Sorry. Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in
PHIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)	OK, let me just start from the very beginning...
PHIL	We got to the restaurant late because we hit all this traffic on the highway-
CL AAA	the shortcut.
PHIL	What? I just think we might have made it on time if we stayed on the highway. Your shortcuts end up being long cuts most o the time. OK, are you going to tell the Policeman or and I gonna tell him?
CLARA	You can tell him.
PHIL	Because you always interrupt me when I try to tell stories, and every time you do it disrupts my flow.
CLARA	Fine, you tell it. I won't say another word.
PHIL	Fine. See, now I've totally lost where I was.
CLARA AND YOUNG POLICEMAN	You got to the restaurant late-
PHIT	Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by the way, was a shortcut - and they gave away our reservation. So we were at the bar and the host was calling out for these other people over and over-
CLARA	Which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation anyway.
PHIL	I thought you said you weren't going to interrupt me, Clara.
C	I just want him to understand we weren't really "stealing" someone else's
RESERVATI	Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows
PHIL	Do you think he really cares, Clara? were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and almost shot! I don't think he's going turn around and book us for reservation theft! Am I right?
YOUNG POLIO OFFICER	Please. Go on.
PHIL	So all of a sudden Clara yells out that we're these other people. You just took someone else's reservation?
PHIL	Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the speakerphone couldn't believe it!
CLARA	You two kinda bonded over that, didn't you?
PHIL	We didn't "bond" over it. I'm just saying, speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do.
YC JG POLICEMAN	Guys, you lost We were in the restaurant. Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's weird to do so it's weird to do?
YOUNG POLICEMAN	Guys? You're new "buddy."
PHIL	Oh c'mon! And we found out speakerphone guy's name, Phil. It's Mr. Stockton. The Young Policeman looks up, interested.
OF FTCER	Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute. The Officer dials an extension on the phone. Lieutecant Manning? ï¿½eeird story. Havea couple '.n here who claim --o have escaped a kid- 7-ng this evening and the name Stockt came up. OK. Will do. He hangs up.
OFFICER (CONT'D)	Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified ere's anything involving Mr. n.
PHIL	Wait. So you already know about this guy? You know who he is? A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's,
LIEUTENANT MANNING	How do you do. Lieutenant Manning. The Officer offers him his note pad. Nah, as long as they're here might as well get everything from the horse's mouth, right? As the Officer heads out of the room, Lieutenant Manning Can I get you guys anything to drink? Coffee? Water? Maybe a shot or two of r whiskey?
PHIL	That sounds more like
LIEUTENANT MANNING	So why don't you tell me all about your incident with Mr. Stockton.
PHIL	You tell it, Clara.
CLARA	Oh, don't be like that, Phil. Please.
LIEUTENANT MANNING	Guys... you've obviously been through something traumatic tonight. Thankfully it's over and you're both safe and sound. Maybe you should cut each other a little bit more of a break. Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air.
PHIL	Seriously, Clara. You tell him.
CJ __	Well, we never a. t_::ally "met" Stockton.
CLARA (CONT`B)	He was in another room on a speakerphone where these guys who kidnapped us took us. But he was obviously the one pulling the strings.
PHIL	Who is this Stockton guy anyway? Let me fill you in on all that later. Now, why would he have wanted to kidnap you two?
CLARA	Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but it's because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner.
LIEUTENANT MANNING	Really? The wrong table?
CLARA	We pretended to be someone else who didn't show up for their reservations. My idea. And it turned out that these people must have something this Mr. Stockton wants.
LIEUTENANT MANNING	Do you know what? Photos. Lieutenant looks up, interested, then writes again.
LIEUTENANT MANNING	That's all you know? Phil and Clara look at each other. Nod. OK. I'm just confused about one thing. When you took this other reservation, how did you know for sure that the real Gales weren't going to show up late? Excuse me?
ENANT MANNING	How were you so sure the Gales weren going to show up if you don't know the at all? Clara looks down at the table, furrowing her brow.
PHIL	Clara?
CLARA	Sorry. I... I lost my train of thought.
PHIL	Well, I can pick things up then. Phil notices Clara giving him a LOOK.
PHIL (CONT'D)	What? Why are you looking at me like that?
CLARA	I'm not looking at you like anything. doesn't pick up on it. Shrugs.
PHIL	OK, well, I had the same question for her when we sat down, which she thought was Rubbing her forehead, Clara KICKS Phil's leg HARD under OW! Jesus! Clara stink-eyes Phil AGAIN, trying to get the message
PHIL (CONT'D)	And there's that look again!
CLARE?	look! No. Looking. At all. RINGING. Lieutenant Manning reaches into his jacket
LIEUTENANT MANNING	Can you excuse me a moment?
E	utenant Manning gets up and exits the room. Clara
PHIL	OK, I'm not dense, Clara. That was not an accident and if those weren't looks-
CLARA	Phil, we're in trou
PHIL	What are you talking about?
CLARA	He's in on this. He's got something to do with it.
PHIL	The police guy? Clara, that's tota
CLARA	never told him about the Gale
PHIL	What do you mean?
CLARA	He said, "How did you know the Gales weren't coming." I never told him that was the name of the reservation we
PHIL	be I said it to the other
CLARA	He didn't take the other notes, Phil. Remember? s hil as well.
PHIL	Oh God.
CLARA	How do we get out of here?
LIEUTENANT MANNING	Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be contained. Right now. Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through .it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside Where'd they go?
OFFICER	They said you were done with them. Manning walks quickly back to his office.
CLARA	We can't just go to another police station, Phil! We don't know how big this is! It might not just be Manning!
PHIL	Well then we're screwed! Who do we go to? The FBI? The CIA? They're not going to believe us over a Police Lieutenant! Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta lose it too. Searching the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE.
PHIL	You've got it, Clara. Spin it back now!
CLARA	just let me do it, She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb.
CLARA (CONT'D)	Dammit! I hate this!
PHIL	It's all right. You just should have spun it when I told you to. Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again.
PHIL (CONT'D)	rn! Quick!
CLARA	Would you stop it? You're stressing me out! Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING Hearing the alarm, a LARGE MAN rushes out of a restaurant
LARGE MAN	Hey! You just hit my The Large Man stomps toward them.
PHIL	Run! Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on
L	Assholes!
EY INS LAT	They catch their breath in the alley. OK. So we've got no car. They know where we live. So where can we- shit. Clara's eyes go wide as it hits her as well.
CLARA	Ollie. Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening Hello? Suddenly, GUNSHOTS RING OUT over the phone.
PHIL	Oh God! Ruth! Is everything OK?
RUTH (PHONE)	No it's not, Phil!
PHIL	What's wrong? It's CSI night! Call after 11! Ruth hangs up the phone, shaking her head, and takes Phil looks at the phone, incredulous.
CLARA	What's wrong?
CLARA	What? Just call her again and tell her what's happened! Phil dials the number again. Ruth picks up.
PHIL	Ruth, I need you to listen. We've
RUTH	We sure do Phil! We sure do! Ruth slams the phone down and pulls out the phone cord so
CLARA	Great, Phil. Now she's not picking up at all!
PHIL	You think this is my fault, don't you? T - ft No. I just don't know why you two can't get along is all.
PHIL	You know, your Mom shows me no respect, 0 Clara. And you just pretend like it isn't happening.
CLARA	So you think it's j1y fault. Listen, Phil. Every single other boyfriend I ever dated got along with her just- Wait a minute! Holbrooke Peterson!
PHIL	What? Clara starts looking through her purse for her phone.
CLARK	Holbrooke Peterson does something hush hush with the FBI! I think he even lives down here.
PHIL	Holbrooke Peterson? You mean the tongue guy?
CLARA	What?
PHIL	Holbrooke was your prom date who you said had the really long tongue, right? Oh yeah. Uh, yeah... something like that... She finds her phone and dials.
PHIL	Since when have you been in touch with Holbrooke Peterson? We found each other on FacebookÂ®
PHIL	Facebook? I didn't know you were on Facebook!
CLARA	It's a networking thing for work. Everyone's on Facebook.
PHIL	0 yeah? Who else are you "in touch" h on Facebook? Hello? Holbrooke? Thank God you're there. It's Clara Foster...
HOLBROOKE	Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same
CLARA	So do you! He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little.
HOLBROOKE	You feel exactly the same too. Phil double-takes. Did he hear him right?
CLARA	This is my husband, Phil.
HOLBROOKE	Ah! The man who actually landed Clara. Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile
HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)	Philly Cheese Steak. Nice to meet you.

PHIL	Whoa. You carry that around at home?
HOLBROOKE	Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her under my pillow. Wish I didn't have to, but I just see it as... I carry the weight so citizens like yourselves don't have to.
CLARA	It's so funny. I always knew you'd end up doing something in public service. I don't know. That's lust how I Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but
HOLBROOKE (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is not a man you want to get on the wrong side of.
HOLBROOKE	He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his head deep in his shell unless he absolutely has to stick it out. Those photos must be really important to him. More jicama, Clara? And sure no Margari-La to calm your nerves?
CLARA	No thanks, I'm Holbrooke picks up the plate and Margarita glass, then What does Stockton do?
HOLBROOKE	Officially, he runs a bunch of these exclusive private clubs downtown where his high powered friends go to let their hair down. Has one place called Le Passage, another called The Rainbow-
CLARA	e Rainbow! Stockton asked how we there to set things up! Interesting. I've had some of my guys looking into Stockton for years, but nothing ever sticks to him. He's very careful - ties up his loose ends and covers his tracks. But with this... he might have accidentally left himself open. two safe. I'm going to call the office, put you under some protection until we figure out the best game

CLARA	And she of you. As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily
HOLBROOKE	I'll just need your full names and your socials so I can get the paperwork started at the bureau. Not yours, Clara. Know that by heart. Both Phil and Clara are taken aback. Just kidding. But I'm sure Phil-a-buster knows 'em both, right? Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands
PHIL	Uh... there's already writing all over this. Does another tree really need to die for me to get your socials, Phil? Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing
HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)	So just one kid, guys? What's keeping you? Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock tuck. Yeah, well, that's a topic for another-
HOLBROOKE	It's just that by now, you and I woulda had a whole brood.
PHIL	That's... charming. Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and

HOLBROOKE	We'll have you stay at the bureau for the night. Safer for you.
CLARA	Thank you so much, Holbrooke. I feel like we're in good hands for the E first time tonight. As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets

PHIL	Well, tell them to stand down.
HOLBROOKE	Uh.. .
PHIL	Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke.

AGENT #3	Our badass I.T. guy! The laughter builds.

AGENT #1	It's your booking, Peterson. We're Just here to back you up. Holbrooke... Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and

AGENT #3	You just gonna take that, Peterson? All right. Didn't want to have to- Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun...
PHIL	All right! Nobody move or he gets it! Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but
AGENT #1	Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even â¢ have a gun? Listen, man. I'm not that important. I'm really not. I'm not the IT guy but I'm just one step above him! No reason to do something rash, all right?

CLARA	Wow, Phil! Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.
PHIL	Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke. When we're about to drive off we'll let you go.
HOLBROOKE	Uh, they were on the keychain.
PHIL	What? HOLB'?n`_ The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard inside. The keys were on that. And so the hero falls...

CLARA	gotta get going! Quick!
PHIL	Where? They both look around, unsure.
HOLBROOKE	Across the bridge a few blocks down that street there's an entrance to the Green Line subway. Get on it and you can get anywhere in this city. Phil and Clara look at him, confused.
PHIL	Aren't you supposed to be our hostage? Whatever. I don't know. Sure. What's the difference? I'm never gonna get behind that desk now anyway. my gun! I dropped it in front of everybody!
PHIL	It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more of a... bobble.
CLARA	Yeah, a bobble's bad...
HOLBROOKE	Listen, if you just leave me here I can tell them you ran the other way. It'll buy you time to get there. And maybe I can work on clearing all this up for you. Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run
CLARA	What?
PHIL	Let me have the gun. As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and Here. Tell them you got it back from us. Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.
HOLBROOKE	Thanks, Phil. As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass
PHIL	it's just on the other side of that bridge. I think we're going to make it. He notices Clara looking at him.
PHIL (COND	What?
CLARA	Nothing. That was just nice of you, back there. This is crazy, but you know what I'm, reminded of right now?
PHIL	Bourne identity?
CLARA	I'm talking about right now. When we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler Planetarium to watch the sunrise.
PHIL	Where I held your hand for the first time.
CLARA	I can't believe we used to stay up all night like that.
PHIL	It's because we could sleep 'til noon. If I remember correctly, we weren't always "sleeping." Beat as they share the moment together, walking.
PHIL	I just don't understand when we got so... I don't know...
CLARA	Old.
PHIL	No, I was thinking numb. When did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad?
CLARA	We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we haven't been that honest with each other recently. Phil doesn't understa
CLARA (CONT'D)	Not big things. Just little things keep adding up and putting this thing between us. Like the fact I know you never want to talk about us having this other baby.
PHIL	It's not that I don't want another kid, Clara. It's just... I used to be the whole pie with you. And now with Ollie and your work, I'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of me's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan I have left of your attention going into some new baby's mouth!
CLARA	But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there! It's all about your work. Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive
CLARA (CONT'D)	Shit!
PHIL	I think we're OK. Just play cool and keep walking. The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1ï¿½1

PHIL	Ow! I think I broke my butt.
CLARA	OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule about tickling?
PHIL	I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure! What is our rule? "It's only funny if it's funny for the both of us."
CLARA	Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny for me, Phil! Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking B i g mistake! They look at her, stunned.
PHIL	T ' s your elbow? 's OK, How`s your butt?
PHIL	Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a moving boat, not so bad. I can't even fucking believe this is happening to us.
CLARA	You know, we're kind of running ou ons.
PHIL	Maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over.
CLARA	What makes you think it ever wil
PHIL	iaybe we should just turn ourselves Imagine what it's going to be like for Ollie when everyone hears about this tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going to be all over the papers. Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to
PHIL	Wait. What if we found the pictures?
CLARA	What do you mean?
PHIL	These pictures that everyone's after. we could get them we'd have some kind o bargaining chip to get out of this.
CLARA	But then we'd have to find the Gales. don't know anything about them. Except... the Rainbow. The pictures have something to do with that place!
PHIL	Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in- Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone,
CLARA	What?
PHIL	You're not listening to me again!
CLARA	"You have to know where they are and h to get in-"
PHIL	That's great. Clara wanna cracker?
C LARA	I'm calling because of what you said, Phil. I know who can help us. Clara dials the number.
CLARA_ (CONT'D)	Hey Jane, it's Clara. Where am I? I'm... I'm on a party cruise around Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into quite a night. Listen, we need to go to this club called the Rainbow later. Do you know how we can get in? Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her

PHIL (CONT'D)	Now if we wanted to do a little cardio, on the other hand. Who knew that many people worked out at 1 in the morning? Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks

RAY	Who are you?
PHIL	Who are we? Good question! Well, everybody thinks we're "the Gales" because we were lucky enough to take your reservation tonight! What? Why would you take our reservation? Phil shoots Clara a look.

E	Frank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS
CLARA	Huh?
CLARA	Phil, this is- Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their
BLACK DUDE	Just let me out, OK? You can have it! 1ï¿½1 You can have it!
PHIL	I'm not yelling! I'm just talking in an very animated voice! Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.
PHIL (CONT'D)	OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel! On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply to t1-
PHIL (CONT'D)	Ahhhh! Other way! Other way! Flustered, Clara WHIPS her wheel in the other direction, Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots
CLARA	What? You just said spin the wheel, Phil! You didn't say which way.
PHIL	Yes I did!
CLARA	No you didn't!
BLACK DUDE	She's right! You di God! Thank you! Can we take him home? I need him! Both Phil and the Black Dude sees that the Towncar's
BLACK DUD	Aw man! I say our best chance is to reverse again, then use both engines to floor as fast as we can all the way down Michigan.
CLARA	Why stay on Michigan?
PHIL	Why stay on Michigan? Because it's a wider street.
LARA	It's also a busier street! I think it would be better to try to branch off. Why do you have a problem with every route I take? Flustered, Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to She does this wherever we go! Every time! Phil doesn't notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude look over Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go SIDEWAYS,
The conjoined cars sail across the	grass and SMASH THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK. Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings,
PHIL	Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight put your foot to the floor. Give it everything! Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors
BLACK	Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that.
CLARA	Doing what? What are you doing?!? Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai
CL. (CONT'D)	Oh God.
PHIL	Just trust me! The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE
STAIRWAY!	The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine
BLACK DUDE	Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man. Wicked. They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil,
PHIL	â¢ Sorry.
BLACK DUDE	s cool. They're back. They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's
BLACK DUDE	Jesus! What the hell are you guys in trouble for? f i ght... you name it.
PHIL	Can we just try to work together at this?
PHIL	I'm not blaming you. Please? Clara nods. Now whatever direction I give you, take your normal version of it and tone it down like 85 percent, OK?
CLARA	35 percent. Fine.
PHIL	OK. Small left. Now!
E	Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara! Now give me a medium right. Do it! She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another
CLAA	Yes!
BLACK DUDE	Now we're cooking with fire! Now tiny le You act it! They make the slightest turn.
PHIL	Yes! No.
BLACK DUDE	Oh no.
CLARA	What? Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in.
BLACK DUDE	say we can pop you guys up and over.
CLARA	Excuse me? What are you talking about, "pop you guys up and over?"
BLACK DUDE	You climb over, then we both reverse it and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you flying over the top.
CLARA	What? Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back
CLARA (CONT'D)	Phil, don't even think of it.
PHIL	can do it. Clara.
CLARA	No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!
BLACK DUDE	Here we go now... One... two... THREE! But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse, The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in opposite The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank
BLACK DUDE	Hope you all got insurance. Hitting a button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on We did it! We did it! A DOOR SLAM. Phil moves an air bag aside to see Clara
CLARA	I want to make sure that at least one our son's parents survives tonight!
PHIL	What?
CLARA	You almost just got us killed!
PHIL	I see. I almost got us killed. Forget about the people chasing and shooting at us all night long because of the reservation you stole.
CLARA	There's a difference between fleeing from people shooting at you and knowingly driving a car in reverse over an open drawbridge!
PHIL	Unbelievable! You know, all you complain about is that I don't take risks anymore. Then the second I do, you get mad at me for doing it! I can't win with you!
CLARA	Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't you!
PHIL	Oh, you have no idea! Every single day from the moment we wake up you're bossy, â¢ disapproving, inconsiderate-
CLARA	I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!? Have you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after Tsunami Phil's blown through? The floor! The sink! You use my toothbrush.
PHIL	What's the difference? Afraid you're gonna get my cooties?
CLARA	I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me! And how many years have I asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet paper in right?
PHIL	Listen to yourself! You have problems with how I pqt in the toilet paper!
C	Because under makes no sense, Phil! Under makes no sense! When it's under it doesn't pull off right! It just keeps spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade properly! After ten years of asking you to have roll the right way, you still can't do it!
PHIL	Yeah, how about the fact that I have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears! You steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself.
CLARA	What? Phil, I do not "steal" the comforter. It just happens when we're-
PHIL	Bulls Bull-shit.
CLARA	Don't you point that at me!
PHIL	I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't think I don't! You wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then reeeeel it in so I can't pull it at all.
CLARA	I do not leg lock the comforter!
PHIL	Oh yes you do!
CLARA	u think I don't know your little icks? Where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in the fridge so you don't have to be the one to "finish" it and replace it?
PHIL	You're right. I do that. You know why do that, Clara?
CLARA	Because you don't want to haul your ass to the market to buy it yourself!
PHIL	Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I the wrong kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath! You're like the Nutrition Nazi.
PHIL (CONT' D )	And I've got to be your little Nutrition Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this "united front" with Ollie! What's wrong if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar instead of one? Or if his handwriting isn't perfect? Or if he goes to school for one day not dressed like Finneas J. Nerdo!
CLARA	Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I must be hard having to be the cool fun parent while I get to be the one who makes sure our child's fed, clothed and
PHIL	How would you even know? You don't give me or anyone else a chance! You're so goddamn controlling! You've got to be Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line, looking down on them from her fancy Wonder Woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder superpowers! You paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady!
CLARA	Urgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay attention to you, Phil? Because you give me a headache! Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a
PHIL	What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse? How could it be? Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks
CLARA	Screw you, Phil!
PHIL	Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I survive tonight I'm screwed all around anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with my job!
CLARA	What are you talking about, screwed with your job? was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so George wouldn't take it over tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen!
CLARA	Why didn't you tell me?
PHIL	I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I didn't want you chiming in on how Mr. Rivers was right. He wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me! Someone who doesn't "play it safe." Someone who'll "take a risk."
CLARA	I can't believe that's what you think do.
PHI	Yeah, well... You know, when you set up this whole "magical" night, in that dress... I got this glimmer that it was going to be like it used to be with us. But... I don't know. I guess we're just not those people anymore. I guess we're not. Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath.
PHIL	I think we said all needs to be said right now, Clara. Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.
CLARA	This... this... this...
PHIL	What? Side cramp... Wow. She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying
PHIL	What is it? Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS
PHIL (CONT'D)	Oh jeez. It's... it's...
C	It's the Mayor. Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in.
PHIL (V.0.)	I bet this didn't have anything to do with Stockton at first.
PHIL	The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's club one night. He saw Dora working there and obviously gave some sign that he was interested.
CLARA	So much for "Mr. Squeaky Clea
PHIL	Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and blackmail him.
CLARA	They knew it was an election year and he would have to pay them whatever they asked.
PHIL	But somehow Stockton found out about the photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself.
CLARA	So he sent his guys to the restaurant to intercept the Gales and get the photos.
PHIL	But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed before the Mayor even had a chance to show up. Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.
CLARA	What?
PHIL	If we could find some way to get in touch with the mayor directly, without anyone else knowing, there actually might be a way out of this for us. Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.
CLARA	can. Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman
DOORMAN	Whoa whoa whoa. Where do you you're going?
CLARA	Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605 The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen
DOORMAN	And you are? looks at him in shock.
CLARA	Are you crazy? It's 4 in the morning! We were lust out for dinner. Trust me
DOORMAN	I'm not really allowed to just let you up there.
CLARA	Please. Just look at us! The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well
DOORMAN	OK. Yeah. Go ahead. The elevator door opens and they get inside.
PHIL	Have a nice night.
DOORMAN	You too.
ELEVATOR	As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each
MRS. CARDIGAN	All right. All- As Mrs. Cardigan opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their Clara grabs her from behind, bringing her down. rubs his paper bag head. Jesus!
PHIL	I can't find any rope. Only yarn.
CLARA	Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I'll start looking. Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying
MRS. CARDIGAN	You two weren't very prepared.
PHIL	Excuse me?
E	You should have been more prepared. Thought ahead and brought the rope you.
PHIL	OK, why don't you lay off the critiqu
MRS. CARD---'--'	's not a critique. It's a fact.
PHIL	Oh is it a fact?
MRS. CARDIGA?	Yes. ng word choice.
PHIL	Wrong word choice? Unbelievable! Well, let me throw a little word choice "correction" your way.
CLARA	Partner!
PHIL	Five year old kids can't be "antagonistic." Phil looks over. Clara makes the "Cut it out" gesture
CLARA (CONT'D)	If you're done tying her up, come over and help. Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks
MRS. CARDIGAN	The name's Cardigan, not Rockefeller, if you haven't figured it out yet! What idiots!
PHIL	You must be such a positive influence on our youth. You're one to talk!
CLARA	Partner! 1ï¿½1 Listen, lady, just sit tight and we'll be out of here before you know it. Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook, when Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens.
CLARA (CONT'D)	Got it! She notices Phil's expression.
CLARA (CONT ' D )	What? hands the book to Clara to read. She does and
CLARA (CONT'D)	Oliver told her he's being mean to Je y Briggs because... he says he wants to marry her? And that's what married people do. As this hits them, Phil and Clara look at each other, What's wrong over there? No "crown jewels" yet?
CLARA	Let's make the call, Lucy? Is everything OK?
PHIL	Lucy? Who's Lucy?
MRS. CARDIGAN	I'm Lucy.
CLARA	You and the Mayor are on a first name basis?
MRS. CARDIGAN	You're calling our Mayor in the middle of the night? I had nothing to do with this Charlie!
CLARA	Charlie?!? Lucy!?!? _ appened to "Â°boundaries matter?â =_.h? What happened to that, bitch?
PHIL	Hey "partner." How about you put a sock in it now. Who is this ? r1
PHIL	You don't know me, Mr. Mayor, but I've recently come into possession of something that you were supposed to get from the Gales tonight. Silence on the line.
PHIL (CONT'D)	Hello? And?
PHIL	And whether you realize it or not, we ended up doing you a favor. You see, this man named Mr. Stockton - I know if you know him-
MAYOR DIGGS (PH(	I know who he is.
PHIL	Well, he tried to steal the photos from the Gales. He's even got cops on his payroll helping him out. We think he was planning to sabotage your re-election. So what do you want for them?
PHIL	What do we want? Phil looks at Clara.
PHIL (CONT'D)	We just want our lives back. We want to go home, Mr. Mayor.
PHIL (PHONE)	That's it. Mayor Diggs breathes out and rubs his forehead. If you really can get me... what I was supposed to receive earlier without this getting out, I promise you I'll take care of your safety. But now the police think that-
MAYOR DIGGS	Trust me. Get me the photos and he won't be bothering you again.
CLARA	is it? Phil's concentrating hard on something. Thinking.
PHIL	Uh... yeah. We'll meet you at the Adler Planetarium in 1 hour. Come alone. E
MAYOR DIGGS	Of course. And... thank you. Click. The Mayor hangs up the phone and quietly leaves
MAYOR DIGGS (PHOII )	We dodged a bullet. They calac _e .
STOCKTON	interesting. ON STOCKTON'S MONITOR in front of him we see that Frank
MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)	They thought you were stealing the photos from the Gales to try to blackmail me yourself.
MR. STOCKTON	Did they, now? That's great.
MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)	They're going to meet me in an hour with them. Alone.
MR. STOCKTON	st keeps getting better. Phil and Clara sit silently on the steps of the
CLARA	Man, I love this city. Always have.
PHIL	When was the last time we watched the sunrise together?
CLARA	Probably the last time we were here. Nope. it wasn't. It was the morning that Ollie was born. You're The morning Ollie was born. They look at each other, remembering.
CLARA (CONT'D)	Man, I'm starving!
PHIL	Me too. Sorry you never got your truffles.
E	Clara reaches into her purse. Who needs white truffles when you've got a lemon zest Luna bar. Clara breaks it in two and hands half to Phil. They
CLARA (CONT'D)	What? OK, what happened to us tonight? the hell are we doing here? Clara starts laughing too.
CLAIRA	It's not funny.
PHIL	No, I know it's not funny. It's not funny at all.
CLARA	en why are you laughing?
PHIL	Why are you laughing? They're both cracking up... then Phil notices a moment Wha e gonna be OK, Cla
CLP--P, A	No. It's not that. just... this is nice. Right now. You don't understand... I really don't want to be Wonder Woman, Phil! I don't At all! You don't see that this whole time I'm flying in a glass plane! In a glass Mane! Uh, OK, but I think Wonder Woman actua flies an invisible plane, not a glass plane. This makes Clara break into a bigger round of sobs.
CLARA	You see! It isn't even there at all! I don't even have a plane! No plane! I'm running on fumes!
PHIL	You're not running on fumes, Clara.
CLARA	I'm not trying to be uptight, or controlling! Or a nutrition...
PHIL	Nazi.
CLARA	Nazi! I'm just trying the only way I know how to keep everything from fall apart!
PHIL	It won't fall apart. And I really can help whenever you feel like it is. With Ollie. Whatever. You just never act like you need me to.
CLARA	That's because as it is you see us as a distraction from your work!
PHIL	You think I see you guys as a distraction? God no, Clara. You don't understand... I have this wife who does everything better than anyone I've ever known. And the greatest son. You want to know why I obsess so much about my stupid job? Because I want to feel like... like I can do something good enough to deserve someone like you. I mean, I look at you and I jest don't stack up.
CLARA	That's crazy, Phil. You do. You're a god man. You're the best man I know.
PHIL	I'll never be the guy who remembers always put toilet paper on the right way.
CLARA	I don't think I would really want to be with that guy, Phil. I just... want us to be on the same team again. As Clara sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat. He
PHIL	Listen, you know what I said before, about not being the people we used to be?
CLARA	Phil, we were angry-
PHIL	No, Clara. It's true. We're not. And I know I'm going to drive you crazy again, and you're definitely going to drive me crazy. But I wouldn't want to do it with anybody else. He hugs her tight.
PHIL (CONT'D)	We had a good fight tonight, didn't we?
CLARA	Yeah, we did. You know the worst part about not talking about all this recently?
PHIL	What?
CLARA	We missed out on a lot of make up sex. And our make up sex woulda rocked!
PHIL	You think?
CLARA	Oh yeah. Phil s when he spots something behind Clara.
PHIL	Here we go. Tell me now. Do you need to pee?
CLARA	1 hold it. They get up and start walking down the steps to meet him.
PHIL	This is what you're looking for. I've tten down our information inside.
MAYOR DIGGS	And that's it?
PHIL	That's it. We're going home now. The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him
PHIL (CONT'D)	Oh God. Run, Clara! Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the
LIEUTENANT MANNING	The next one won't be a warning shot. They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and
MR. STOCKTON	Let's do it over there. y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on
MAYOR DIGGS	I'm going to wait in the c r don't mind.
MR. STOCKTON	Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.
E	As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he
PHIL	Please. Please don't do
LIEUTENANT MANNING	Over there.
PHIL	Please! We have a child!
'VT MINING	said over there! Just me then, OK? I promise you she's not going to say anything! Please! We have a child!
LIEUTENANT MANNING	Last time I'm going to say it. Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then On your knees. Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his
WHAT THE	Mr. Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn. Mayor Diggs
PHIL	-eally were planning to give you the pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you -.sre so casual about is not needing to worry about the cop who was after us. That made me a little suspicious because I never told you which cop it was.
CLARA	Then we got to talking and realized how dumb we were. E If you came on to some waitress at the Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn comfortable there.
PHIL	Which meant Stockton was probably your buddy.
MR. STOCKTON	Where are the pictures?
PHIL	But we were still confused, because if you guys are buddies, how do you explain the Falconwood Corporation? Mr. Stockton's face blanches.
MR. STOCKTON	They're obviously not going to tell us! Just shoot them!
MAYOR DIGGS	Wait. I've heard that name. What's the Falconwood Corporation?
PHIL	Runs the hiring of inspectors for the Department of Highways in Chicago. You know, the ones who have been finding all those violations?
MR. STOCKTON	Manning! I said shoot them!
LIEUTENANT MANNING	I work for the Mayor, Terrence.
MAYOR DIGGS	Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence?
PHIL	Maybe because according to the paperwork you've got there, he owns Falconwood.
CLARA	Not only that, you'll see those other pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called Eurostruct - which rents the city all of its construction equipment.
MR. STOCKTON	Frank, Harry! Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns
PHIL	The more violations Falconwood finds, the That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor. I'm sure that's not a moral problem for you, but he's kind of screwing you in an election year, isn't he? Some of us are pretty pissed off about the roads. Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all
MAYOR DIGGS	You did this to me? I don't get it, Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I have the Lieutenant here watch your back on all of your gambling clubs-
MR. STOCKTON	Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble at? Where I cover your debts? Those clubs?
MAYOR DIGGS	I slipped your company 5 no-bid foreclosed buildings for a dollar each downtown.
MR. STOCKTON â¢	You think that pays for what I do for you? The girls I have to pay off? The jet charters? And let's not even get into your "re-election fund"! Let's not even go there! Listen to them. Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket
MR. STOCKTON	How did you get this? How?
HOLBROOKE (O.S.)	Tha be from me. Mr. Stockton and others turn around to see HOLBROOKE
HOLEROOK E (CONT ' D )	FBI! Drop it! Manning tried to object, pulling out his bad
HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)	Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy. With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the
MAYOR DIGGS	Aw fuck. Makes you feel any better, I wasn't gonna vote for you anyway.
CLARA	either.
Â¢ CLARA	Everything OK?
HOLBROOKE	Yeah. They just need me downtown in half an hour for a news conference with the Deputy Mayor. Want it for the morning shows.
PHIL	Don't think they're going to be calling you the IT guy any-more.
HOLBROOKE	Listen guys, I feel weird about not even acknowledging you two.
CLARA	Don't.
HOLBROOKE	But you should be up there with me. You handed this whole case to me.
PHIL	Yeah, well-, that's how we roll. They get out of the car and start up the driveway.
CHAZ (O.S.)	Hey hey! Up bright and early, aren Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in
PHIL	Yep. We sure are. As he joins Clara on the doorstep, they take each other
CLARA	You have your presentation in a few hours. Yeah. You know, I think I'm gonna be OK. I had a good time tonight.
PHIL	Yeah. Me too. It was fun.
CLARA	It was.
PHIL	So... let's do this again sometime? like that. For the first time the whole night, THEY KISS.
