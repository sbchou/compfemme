CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
LATER	Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
JOE (V.O.)	Time travel has not yet been invented. But twenty five years from now it will be. Once the technology exists, it will be relatively cheap and available to the public at large. And so. It will be instantly outlawed, used only in secret by the largest criminal organizations. And then only for a very specific purpose. Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	It's nearly impossible to dispose of a body in the future. I'm told. Tagging techniques, whatnot. So when these future criminal organizations in the future need someone gone, they use specialized assassins in our present, called loopers.
JOE (V.O.)	And so. Thirty years from now. My employers in the future nab the target, they zap him back to me, their looper. And I do the necessaries. So the target has vanished from the future, and I've just disposed of a body that technically does not exist. Clean. The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.
BEATRIX	Bon jour, Joe.
JOE	Bon jour, Beatrix.
BEATRIX	How's the French?
JOE	Slow. How's the coffee?
BEATRIX	Burnt. Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down. Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
JOE	Two, Jedd. Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
DALE	Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?
JOE	Yup. Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
DALE	Four, Jedd. Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.
LATER	On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.
JOE	Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!
JOE	Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok. A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
SETH	Walk around! Around, I'm not kidding. Wide around, ya shit. The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.
JOE	Seth.
SETH	Hi Joe.
JOE	That's new. Seth kicks the bike.
SETH	Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going to the Belle?
JOE	Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick with rubber on the road.
SETH	Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them, they get respect.
JOE	They get respect cause they run the town. How much did that thing set you back? How much? Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.
SETH	I was gonna pull up in it. Tonight. Heads or tails, call it in the air. The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.
JOE	Congratulations. You're pulling up with me instead. Joe notices the floating quarter.
JOE (CONT'D)	And don't, if we're going in, don't do that.
SETH	Chicks dig TKs.
JOE	It's tacky, don't do it. Seth catches the quarter, sullen.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	When the TK mutation started appearing in the general populace it was on every magazine - âNext Step in Evolution, what's next.â Everyone got tested. But turns out this was it, and now it's just a bunch of assholes thinking they're blowing your mind by floating quarters.
JOE (V.O.)	Big heads. Small potatoes. Drives past, revving the engine.
BIG CRAIG	No loopers in the club on Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only. Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.
JOE	We'll stick backstage, just meeting up. In and out.
BIG CRAIG	Packing your blunderbusses?
JOE	Hardly. Right Seth?
SETH	Hardly. I'm with Joe. Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.
SETH	So are we - hey - Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.
MADAME	No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat Men only.
JOE	So I've read. He ducks out.
SETH	Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what- Joe? And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.
JOE	What?
DALE	Zach. In there right now, with Abe. Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
JOE	For what?
DALE	He closed his loop. This lands heavily on Joe.
JOE	No shit? The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another The loopers watch him in awe.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	There's a reason we're called loopers.
JOE (V.O.)	Time travel in the future is so illegal, that when we sign up for this job we agree to a very specific proviso. Zach raises his gun.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	If our employers in the future get busted up by the law, their first priority is going to be erasing any trace of their relationship with us ever existing. A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	So. If they're busted, and if we're still alive 30 years from now, they'll find our older self and zap him back to us, like any other job. Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	This is called closing your loop. Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And you get paid out a mythic amount of money, and you get a handshake and get released from your contract. Enjoy the next 30 years.
JOE (V.O.)	This job doesn't tend to attract the most forward thinking people.
ZACH	So are we celebrating? At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty
KID BLUE	No loopers on fucking Wednesdays! The loopers collectively flip him off.
ZACH	Suck one, kid!
IN THE CAR	Jammed with Seth and Loopers, Joe at the wheel. Still so
IN THE CAR	Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
JOE	Sell that goddamn slat bike back. That's a lot of stupid money.
SETH	I got stupid money. Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's
JOE	Alright. Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.
SETH	I think I did something. You know what? TKs are special. Fuck you.
JOE	Hey Seth. Seth slumps against the car. Alright, Zach. What's his payout, 30? 40? If that? That's not going to last you 30 years. And it won't get you overseas.
SETH	Overseas...
JOE	So in five, ten years you're back to riding the rails, or worse you're like Kid Blue, working as a gat man, wagging your dick at loopers and roughing up shop clerks for payoff money.
SETH	Fuckin Kid Blue.
JOE	Save a little something. Alright? Cause that'll be yours, and then you've got yours and that's all that matters, your life is your own.
SETH	I gots mine you gots yours. I wish I was smart like you. Saint Joe. Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.
BEATRIX	Bon jour Joe.
JOE	Ravi de te voir, Beatrix.
BEATRIX	Ooh la la.
JOE (OVER SPEAKER)	Two, Jedd. Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number â2'.
DALE	What's that, fourth loop closed this month? Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his
JOE	Fourth. On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can
SUZIE	Hey.
JOE	You working a shift tonight?
SUZIE	Yeah. Yeah, but one of the gat men bought me out already. For the night.
JOE	Oh.
SUZIE	Sweetie. I gotta work. She leaves him watching her go. He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs. Then wakes with a jump, Goes to the door. A screen shows nobody in the hall outside.
JOE	Jesus, Seth.
SETH	They're gonna be here any minute, are they here?
JOE	No, they're not here. Who?
SETH	Christ. Joe. Christ. Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns What are you doing? Right. Smart.
JOE	Seth, sit down here. CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens
SETH	Late to my own funeral. Mom always said...
JOE	Tell me now.
SETH	Christ, Joe. Late to my own goddamn funeral. Can you help me?
JOE	Seth, what did you do?
SETH	You can protect me a little, right? Just so they don't... jeez. Oh jeez. This is like a nightmare. This is a nightmare. I knew then what he did so I don't know why I asked. What did you do? Seth lifts his eyes to Joe.
SETH	He was singing. Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates.
SETH (V.O.)	Through the gag and mask, but I could hear the tune. Deep memories, my mom in a dark room, singing. Back warm and safe, when I coulda still been good. And once I knew it was him... Joe I couldn't. I couldn't. I had to see. Seth pulls the sack off the man's head.
SETH	Joe I can't even tell you. Looking in his eyes. I had to let him talk, then. I don't even remember the words, but I remember believing every one of them, or not even believing, but submitting. I've never felt that small before. I've never felt that happy. He told me. I remember, there's a new holy terror boss-man in the future, and he's closing all the loops. The Rainmaker, they call him. He told me.
SETH (CONT'D)	Then he wanted a cigarette and I untied him, and he gives me this look. And he just starts running.
SETH (V.O.)	And I had my blunderbuss so I know he's got about fifteen strides till he's out of my range. And they come and go, and I just watch him till he's gone.
JOE (V.O.)	This is called letting your loop run. It's not a good thing.
SETH	What do I do? You're the only friend I got Joe you gotta help me
JOE	You fucking idiot coming here. Seth, sucker punched. You can't be here, I'll give you a little money but you gotta
SETH	Joe? A little - where am I gonna -
JOE	You hop a freight train, you beat it the hell out POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound
JOE (CONT'D)	Shut up. Don't move. Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside.
KID BLUE	Open up Joe! Watch the window. Joe spins from the door. Considers briefly.
JOE	I can't do anything for you Seth. Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.
SETH	No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide me, please Christ please Joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and I'll leave please-
JOE	Hold on! Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face, POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door. One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's
KID BLUE	That took awhile.
JOE	You think it's easy looking this good?
KID BLUE	Tye's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe. Joe grabs a jacket.
JOE	There's coffee in the tin.
TYE	Thank you. Two minutes.
LATER	Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid
KID BLUE	You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's impossible to hit anything farther than 15 feet, and impossible to miss anything closer. A gun for fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat. A gat has range. Accuracy. His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
JOE	Alright, cut it out Kid. You're gonna blow your foot off again. The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.
KID BLUE	You're right, it'd be real easy for it to accidentally go off. He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.
JOE	C'mon.
KID BLUE	Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper. Joe stifles a chuckle. In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the What the hell is going on out there- The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
KID BLUE	S'alright, s'alright. Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
ABE	Alright. Joe. Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.
ABE (CONT'D)	You didn't shoot your other foot off, didja kid? The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.
ABE	My great grandfather always told my grandfather, men's like spiders. It's the little ones you gotta be careful of.
JOE	Dunno I agree with that.
ABE	Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did my great grandfather know. This man is from the future. He was sent back here by the mob, a one way ticket, to run the Loopers. That's low effort even for Abe, so to pass the time he recruited some real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he runs the city. Any other city, that'd be impressive. Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe.
ABE	How can you kids stand those chokers? This, the cravats.
JOE	Ties.
ABE	Ridiculous. You're aware we don't have a dress code. Fashion.
ABE	You know, you don't know, the movies you're dressing like were copying other movies. Goddamn 20th century affectations, do something new. Put a glowing thing around your neck or use... rubberized.. Be new.
JOE	Okay. A beat of silence.
JOE (CONT'D)	Well it was nice chatting with you Abe.
ABE	I do like you, Joe. But we're sure enough Seth paid you a visit we're gonna hafta do something about this.
JOE	Seth?
ABE	You're expecting we're gonna break your fingers with a hammer or something awful, and I'm going to diffuse that tension right now, that isn't going to happen. What's going to happen is, I'm going to talk for a little, not even that long, then you're gonna give up your friend.
JOE	My friend Seth? I'm confused.
ABE	Well then I'll talk a little. You know you were the youngest looper I ever hired? You looked goddamn ridiculous they said, the blunderbuss up to here on you. But I remember they brought you in, I forget what it was for,
JOE	Watch shop.
ABE	That's yeah, you had rolled one of our fronts, a watch shop. And they had you, your arms pinned, this kid. Like an animal. But you looked at me, your hair stuck to half your face so just this one eye looking at me. And I thought what's this kid lived through, what he had taken away from him. What's he lost. And I could see, like seeing it happen clear as seeing it, the bad path in front of you, the bad version of your life. Like a vision I saw it happen, you turning bad. So I cleaned you up and put a gun in your hand. I gave you something that was yours.
JOE	You know I'm grateful, Abe. Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.
ABE	I gave you something that was yours. And I remember that kid, and I think when you ask yourself you ask who would I sacrifice for what's mine, I think Seth is deep and cozy inside that circle. Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.
ABE (CONT'D)	That hammer's there for something else later, that's not, it's a bad coincidence.
JOE	Okay.
ABE	Show you how much I know you, I'm not even gonna break you, just set you back a ways.
ABE (CONT'D)	We know you've been stashing half your bars. Which is smart. You give up Seth, or you give us half your stash. For Seth. Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and
JOE	Will you kill him?
ABE	No. Would be too cataclysmic a change to the future. What we'll do is dangerous in that regard, but not as dangerous as killing him, and not by twice as having him run free. Joe I let him run more than a few days, the boys in the future get nervous, then bing! my replacement shows up. With a gun. So we'll do what we have to do. Silence.
JOE	Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742. One of the gat men quietly exits.
ABE	It's the little ones that get you.
ABE	Why don't you kill an hour, Joe. On the house. After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.
ABE (CONT'D)	Call the doc.
MADAME	Suzie's just getting off. Doubt she's up for it. He pushes through the velvet curtained door.
JOE	I can't remember my mother's face. I remember her touching my hair. Like this. He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles Do you want to go overseas?
SUZIE	Do I want to go overseas? With you? Now?
JOE	Soon, maybe.
SUZIE	Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet boy. You gotta be careful, it's easy to think you know someone once you been like this. What's in here is services rendered.
JOE	Is that how it aughta be?
SUZIE	What, in nature? You know I get this a lot. Especially young guys. I must have wife eyes or something. His face clouds. He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and But stops. On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly Then his face changes. Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
MINUTESÂ	Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well. He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face... He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
OLD SETH	No no no no no! A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
The car hits a pole.	Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45. Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the 1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers 2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man. 5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair. 7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire. 2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong. But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face 57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe. It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER. In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
JOE	Oh god. Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no
JOE (CONT'D)	Late to my own funeral.
KID BLUE (O.S.)	That's twenty four there. I'm keeping count.
TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)	Uh huh. Two more trips should do it. Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches. A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
JOE	Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell him keep my bars safe cause I swear to god I'm going to fix this, I'm going to find my loop and I'm gonna kill him. Tell Abe- CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling - When he hits the ground the world goes away. This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He Joe ignores them, walks out. LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray. Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
âSORTIE.â	Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss. His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the A long moment. With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch. A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The Flash and crack and he is sent. At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls
OLD JOE	And your jacket.
OLD JOE	Shit. Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it. After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the
KID BLUE	Two more trips. They enter the building. Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse. Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
OLD JOE	Stupid little shit. He lifts him in his arms. Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
ABE (PRE-LAP)	He ain't dumb like the last, we gotta get lucky now. Cover the roads out of town. Sweep the streets, pull in his social circle, pound the pavement.
GAT MAN 3	He'll hop a train. Fast and untraceable.
ABE	Maybe. Sweep the train yard. Every second that passes is bad, go.
ABE	Stupid little shit.
KID BLUE	I can't hear you Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts
ABE	Well that's what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit.
KID BLUE	I can fix this. I can find him.
ABE	Go home and let the grown ups work. Kid Blue. Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely
JOE	Where would I go if I were me. He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the Goes back the way he came, turns a corner. A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer. Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve, Then âA then âTâ... He bares his arm, reading the entire Empty. He deflates. Thinks. Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up. Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something. Kid Blue stops the screen. He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared. Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
The same from the previous flashback.	Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE. Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in
âBEATRIX.â	Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.
BEATRIX	Coffee?
OLD JOE	Please. Black. And water.
BEATRIX	Anything else? Are we eating?
JOE	I ordered something.
OLD JOE	Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled.
BEATRIX	Two steak & eggs coming up. She goes. Another pause.
OLD JOE	We're not going to talk about time travel.
JOE	...ok.
OLD JOE	Must hurt. His arm.
JOE	Yeah. Didn't know if you'd
OLD JOE	I put it together. Clever. Do I get the scar when you're cut, or when the knife is on its way down and it's inevitable that you're going to be cut?
JOE	I'm not cutting myself again to-
OLD JOE	I'm not asking you to.
JOE	It's an interesting question, I've just lost a lot of blood today.
OLD JOE	You know there's another girl here on weekends. Sue.
OLD JOE	Well. Have fun explaining who âBeatrix' is for the next thirty years. Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	How's the French coming?
JOE	Good.
OLD JOE	I know you have a gun between your legs. Joe's face registers obvious incomprehension.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	No? Well you'll get there eventually. Obviously.
JOE	I don't care what you're here for, whatever you think you're going to get from me. More time or whatever you want. I can't let you walk away from this diner alive. Because the next 30 years of my
OLD JOE JOE	I'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours been practicing all night, can say anything you want but
OLD JOE	You know what the voice of god sounds like? See now good you're confused now but you're listening. I hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking French. Old men speaking French sound like primeval trees in a strong wind, just irrefutable. Wise, strong, gentle, all these things in harmony, complimentary. At once. Old men speaking French. Young men speaking French sound, without exception, like weenies. Fact. You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening? It's hilarious. English is a tight t- shirt, flatters the young. Rat a tat tat. French is a double breasted suit. Young man can put it on, but it always feels like he's putting something on. Some things, you just need the years. It's my favorite language.
JOE	I've got a life ahead of me that's mine and I'm not giving it up for you or anybody
OLD JOE	Well you know what you have to do then why don't you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it. One in the head, two in the heart. Boy. It's all âanybodyâ and âneverâ and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying. Well bullshit we both know you're not going to kill me. Christ you ordered eggs. Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	I know why you couldn't pull that trigger. When you're tasked to do the unthinkable, your mind, it'll do anything it can to stop you. Only way is you gotta know why you're doing it, in your bones, so you can say it out loud to someone without apologizing. Or you gotta cut yourself off, go numb. But that'll kill you, down the line. It's hard to make eye contact with you. It's too strange.
JOE	Your face looks backwards.
OLD JOE	Yeah, that helps actually. That little twist of unfamiliar. You're not winning some pissing contest by looking me in the eye, you didn't know what I looked like until yesterday, it makes sense that it's easier for you.
JOE	I wasn't trying to. Do you know what's going to happen? Have you already done all this, right now, as me?
OLD JOE	No not - exactly - I don't want to talk about time travel shit, because we'll start talking about it and then we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws. It doesn't matter.
JOE	When I hurt myself now, it changes your body. Do my actions change your memories?
OLD JOE	It doesn't matter because I don't know how it works. Nobody knows how it works. Time travel was an accident, thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you don't: they know to be scared to death of it. My memory is cloudy, there's a cloud. It's a, it starts clear then gets cloudy as it goes back.. Goddammit hand me those. Straws. Joe passes him two.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	And the salt. No, the pepper. The pepper. Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	Ok, the span between the straws is a timeline of the next 30 years.
THIS	is the present moment, right now.
AND THIS	is the moment thirty years from now when I was sent back. The machine is tuned to a fixed time, you know that, 30 some years, it's not adjustable.
JOE	What's the pepper?
OLD JOE	The pepper is a sort of fog. See my memories start clear here, but as they go back they get cloudier, until they're totally obscured. It's like a fog. Because my memories aren't really memories, they're one possible eventuality now, and they grow clearer or cloudier as they become more or less likely. But then they get to the present moment And they're instantly clear again. Like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment. I can remember what you do after you do it. He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
JOE	So you can
OLD JOE	And it hurts.
JOE	So when we're apart you can remember what I do. After I do it.
OLD JOE	Uh huh. But Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	This is a precise description of a fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks everything, my brain and body try to catch up. It's messy. That's why it's dangerous. And it hurts. All I know I know two things for sure. I know what's happening in my head. And I know that you're still going to meet her.
JOE	Who? Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his This is a woman, what? I'm going to fall in love with?
OLD JOE	She's gonna save your life. Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time, The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	For a long time at the beginning she thought we'd have a baby. She would have been a good mother. She wanted that so much. And now I'm saying sorry to a picture.
JOE	She's. How is she, you said save my life.
OLD JOE	Your life. Let's look. At your life. You're a killer and a junkie. And a fucking child mentality, âMy life,â âwhat's mine.â Save your life, you're asking how? The question is why. Why would someone waste themselves on you, give up the good life they had, sacrifice a good life to love you.
JOE	My life is my own, I don't need it
OLD JOE	Shut your fucking child mouth. She's going to clean you up and you're going to take her love like a sponge and you're both going to pretend that she's saved you, you're so self absorbed and stupid. Yesterday. Thirty years from now is yesterday. And I can remember it, it's going to happen. Let me tell you what's going to happen to this woman who saved your worthless life. A GREEN DOOR - Kicked in with all the violence in the world. Old Joe screams, struggles, but cannot stop them from doing
OLD JOE	Have you heard of the Rainmaker?
JOE	Seth said, that night. A new boss in the future, he said.
OLD JOE	The Rainmaker came out of nowhere and in the span of six months took total control of the five major syndicates.
JOE	That would take an army.
OLD JOE	But he didn't have an army. Legend is he did it alone. Alone alone. Don't know I believe the legend but he didn't have an army.
JOE	How did he do it?
OLD JOE	That's the question. And no one knows. Not only that, there's no pictures of him. It's insane. There's stories he has a synthetic jaw. Things like that. But word spread quick about him through the ex-looper grapevine, even before his mass executions and vagrant purges and reign of terror, because the first thing he did was start closing loops. All of them. Exterminating the whole program. Cleaning house. Old Joe pulls the folded papers he printed at the library out
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	Do you know what this is? This number. This number. On the back of his papers he scrawls the number: 07153902935. The wall with the door in it EXPLODES inward. This is a piece of identifying information on the Rainmaker. I can use it to find him, now, and stop him from killing my wife.
JOE	None of this concerns me. We're done we're gonna walk outside now.
OLD JOE	This is going to happen
JOE	It happened to you, it doesn't have to happen to me. You got her picture in there? Show it to me. Show me her picture. And when I see her for the first time I'll walk away, and she won't be with me.
JOE (CONT'D)	I guarantee the instant I look at her picture that fog in your brain will swallow up the memories of her and she'll be gone.
OLD JOE	Gone.
JOE	She'll be safe. And then we can all do what we have to do. A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.
OLD JOE	No you don't understand. We don't have to give her up. I'm going to tell you why I'm here now. He puts his hand on the folded papers.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	I'm gonna save her. A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	The Rainmaker is alive right now. Living here, somewhere in this county. And I can find him with this. I need you to lay low, stay out of my way and not get caught. I know how to fix this, I won't stop till I finish it. I'm going to find him and kill him. Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.
JOE	It's been awhile since we've gotten a warm-up. Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
OLD JOE	It's been thirty years for me, so it's hard to remember. When you stole Seth's bike you stripped out the security tracker. Right? Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	Make it to the field, you can lose them in the field. Go east and hop
A TRAIN	Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His
JOE	I've got him! He's here! A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks. Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
OLD JOE	Shit. Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
DINER GAT MAN	The back, he's running!
JOE	Around back! They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
KID BLUE	Alive! No, alive! Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.
JOE	No fuck no fucking piece of shit CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the
KID BLUE	The tracker! Get the tracker! Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK. A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
SARA	C'mon baby. Time to get up. Then freezes. Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front She watches right back for a long moment. Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields. Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
SARA	Listen up fucker. I have shot and buried three vagrants in the past year. If you want to know the Christ's honest truth I'm starting to get a taste for it. So I don't care what hobo sob story you've got, I get a dozen a week and it cuts no cash with me. It's me and my husband here, we're broke and angry at our lot in this world and heavily armed. So take some corn and move on, but if you show your face again I will cut you the fuck in half. Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
LATER	Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a His gun on his knee. JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces. The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.
JOE	C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.
ABE	Well. You found him. And you russeled up a posse and went to git âem. Like a good little cowboy from one of your movie movies. Without telling me.
KID BLUE	I can do it again.
ABE	You can fuck up again? Really. You know what happens to me if I don't get that old bastard? I got too much riding, Kid, I can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy. Put your gat on the table. Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he
KID BLUE	I wanted you to say I did good, that's all I wanted. This is all I have. Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the
KID BLUE (CONT'D)	Please just give me one more chance, I'll bring him here alive and hold him and you can put a bullet in his brain yourself- Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls
KID BLUE	I'm gonna make this good again. I will. I'm gonna be back. But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
KID BLUE	Oh no. Oh no no no no He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps, The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.
KID BLUE (CONT'D)	No! No! No no no no! Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
KID BLUE (CONT'D)	Oh. Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
SARA	Hey. Who's there. Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.
SARA (CONT'D)	Stop right there. Stop! His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he
SARA	You stop right there, you stop! She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK And the Dark Man STOPS. It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A
BLESS YOUÂ	Joe lowers his gun, face melting.
SARA	Jee sus. Hey, hey. I'm going to get you But the man scampers off, leaving his sign. ...great.
SARA	Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn hobo sign oh for godssakes. Alright, what are you? Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck- ehh. Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes.
SARA	Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey. My head... splitting apart... time eventualities, he said-
SARA	How long since you dropped?
DROPPED	Sara mimes an eye dropper.
SARA	Dropped, or what the kids call it.
JOE	A day.
SARA	One day. Wow. She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in
JOE	Thirsty. I can't feel my legs
SARA	You're withdrawing from a synthetic barbiturate. It's a quick punch but it's this bad a day in, without care you might not make it through the night. Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house.
JOE	Thirsty. Thirsty. Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he Cid. C'mere monkey. Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe.
CID	Who's that man?
SARA	Just a vagrant babe.
CID	No he's not.
SARA	Oh yeah?
CID	His shoes are too shiny.
SARA	Well aren't you a smart monkey.
CID	Is he sick?
SARA	Yup.
CID	Will he get better?
SARA	Yup.
CID	Promise?
SARA	Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby boy. Kisses him.
CID	Night Sara. Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.
SARA	Ssssshhit.
SARA	Water. Drink it, all night, more than you think you want. Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.
SARA (CONT'D)	Aim for the bucket. And don't chew your tongue off. In the morning we're gonna talk. The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and
SARA	Hey.
OLD JOE	The first time I saw her face.
SARA	Hey.
OLD JOE	No. No no. His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.
OLD JOE	No. The first time I saw her face. Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink.
SARA	Morning monkey.
CID	The man's up. Sara stiffens, looks out the window.
CID (CONT'D)	Is he staying here now?
SARA	No.
A WALL OF LEAVES	Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
SARA	Toss it. Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed
JOE	I just finished cleaning - alright. Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.
SARA	How do you feel?
JOE	I'm at thirty percent.
SARA	Take it slow and by the end of the week you'll be at fifty. Good. She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.
SARA (CONT'D)	I took you in so you wouldn't die, and now you're not going to die. So take the morning to rest, then you need to get off my farm.
JOE	I can't do that.
SARA	I'm sorry?
JOE	I need to stay here for a little while longer.
SARA	I am not cool with that.
JOE	Well I'm sorry.
SARA	Well I'm sorry too, you just lost your take the morning to rest privileges, get off my farm.
JOE	No. Sara raises the shotgun.
SARA	Get off my farm.
JOE	No. You couldn't scare a retarded hobo with that thing. Literally.
SARA	This is a Remington 870, one blast could cut you the fuck in half.
JOE	And that's, that's telling. You're holding a gun. I say I'm not afraid, so you describe the gun to me. But it's not the gun I'm not afraid of. What are you gonna shoot in the air? Blow a hole in your barn? To scare me? Go ahead. But you couldn't let me die, you won't kill me.
SARA	So now I saved your life that makes me weak?
JOE	Look I'm not a threat to you or your boy. I need to be on your property but I'd prefer to not have any contact with you at all, I'll stay in the fields. There's just one thing you need to do for me, and you won't have to deal with me again. He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
JOE (CONT'D)	Just, verify for me that's your house on the map. So I know I'm in the right place.
SARA	What is this?
JOE	A map.
SARA	That's my house. Why is it marked?
JOE	Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out of the barn in an hour, if you can spare it I'll take the water jug with me. Does that well have water? I'll fill it from there. Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote And everything changes.
SARA	What is this. She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
SARA (CONT'D)	What is this.
JOE	Does that mean something to you? For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her Joe scoots back And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM.
SARA	Who are you? She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury
SARA (CONT'D)	You're right I'm not a killer but I am fine with how a blast of rock salt to your face won't kill you. Who are you and what are you here for? Who are you? Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his
JOE	Time travel hasn't been invented yet. But in thirty years it will be. Old Joe approaches him.
OLD JOE	Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's father. Aren't you going to come over? We're doing cake.
DANIEL	It's ice cream cake and I can't eat ice cream. Cause of the milk.
OLD JOE	Well you should join the party even if you don't have cake. You have a birthday coming up?
DANIEL	In July. We were gonna go to the lake but I don't think we are now.
OLD JOE	I'm sorry. Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble
JOE	I can't go back to the city and find him cause Abe, the boss, all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or... him. All I have is this map. And that he's coming here. Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.
SARA	A Looper.
JOE	Yeah. Did you know about Loopers, what we do
SARA	I've heard stories. So he's coming here to murder me and my son because he thinks we might be this Rainmaker. And once he kills the Rainmaker, what happens?
JOE	I think... he thinks, the instant the rainmaker dies, he'll never have been sent back, so he'll just vanish, and be back with his wife.
SARA	Who is he? The guy you let run? Just some random guy from the future?
JOE	Yeah. Someone. You know what these numbers mean. Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door She draws lines with the pen, thus:
SARA	This is my son Cid's birthday. And this is the hospital he was born in. Joe's face, taking this in. He draws his gun in one fluid motion and FIRES. And we just see Old Joe's face. Struggling now to remain Numb he puts his gun away and exits. The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass, She unsnaps her GREEN DRESS and it falls, leaving her naked
LATER	On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby. Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the
SARA	Would he do this?
JOE	Think about what doing this would fix. What he thinks it would fix. Sara caught that, and she did not like it. He'll kill the other kids on that map and then come here last. Put off facing me.
SARA	If he comes here, can you stop him? She turns the paper over in her hands.
SARA (CONT'D)	Given this, if I erred on the side of caution and believed all of this, I'm asking. If I trusted you. Will you stop him before he gets to my son?
JOE	I've lost my life. I kill this man, I get it back. You can trust me.
JOE	We're surrounded by the corn, that leaves us blind. He can get within fifty yards of the house without a hawk spotting him. What makes sense is, we burn the fields, level them. Sara realizes he's seriously asking.
SARA	No you cannot burn down my corn fields.
JOE	What kind of equipment's in the barn?
SARA	Farm equipment.
JOE	Nothing that shoots.
SARA	No farm equipment that shoots. No. Joe finishes assembling his gun. Sara's eyes flick to it. You use what you need, set up anywhere. But one thing, I don't want you talking to Cid. I watch my son, you watch the corn. That's the deal.
JOE	Good by me. He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.
SARA	Hold still. Easy for things to get infected on a farm, start falling off. Pussy. Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles. Then grimaces.
JOE	If I'm out here and you're in the house we're gonna need some way to communicate.
SARA	There's a dinner bell down by the barn, ring that if someone's coming, I'll hear it.
JOE	Dinner bell. We need walkies, or buzzers.
SARA	Dunno what we've got but I'll look. She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.
SARA (CONT'D)	Cid. She goes to take him inside.
JOE	Got any ammo for that shotgun? That isn't a seasoning?
SARA	How's the maths coming?
CID	I wanna help the man.
SARA	Help him what?
CID	I could help him with my toys.
SARA	Baby. Listen. I need you to stay away from that man. Okay? Let him-
HEY	Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but
SARA (CONT'D)	Let him do his thing, but you stay with me.
CID	Is he not good?
SARA	Well we're gonna see what he is. But you stick with me. Yeah? Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face. In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining. CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep. Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
CID	Hand me that Phillips. Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.
CID (CONT'D)	Tell me if you hear her coming.
JOE	What are we doing here?
CID	Commundication. He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and But I need to make it stronger.
JOE	How do you do that?
CID	Bigger battery. Joe idly fingers a toy.
JOE	Smart.
CID	Do you kill people? Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.
JOE	Let's say I kill people.
CID	With your gun?
JOE	Uh huh. Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he A long beat, Joe thinking. Broken by a PIERCING NOISE. They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off, And look up at the ceiling. Silence in the house. With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
JOE (CONT'D)	How long have you and your mom been on the farm?
CID	She's not my mom. My mom got killed when I was a baby. Someone bad, bad men killed her. Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.
JOE	I'm sorry.
CID	Sara doesn't think I remember cause I was a baby. But I remember my mom. I couldn't stop her getting killed. I don't remember it all but I remember. I was a baby. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't stop it. Cause I was a baby. Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.
JOE	I'm sorry Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating. You should talk to your mom about this.
CID	She's not my mom. She's a liar. With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits. Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car.
GAT MAN 1	-spotted him coming out of a sewer tunnel on the west end, he's on the
ABE	Every fucking car, every gat, every cop - get âem down there! Flood that fucker! Take him down! And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs. After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go-
JOE	Can't you pull that out with a plow?
SARA	Uh huh. She keeps chopping.
JOE	I found a, in the barn I found some parts, and I made a, thing. Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now
JOE (CONT'D)	If you see anything, just push that, and, Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and
JOE (CONT'D)	It's important.
SARA	When?
JOE	Last night. He woke me up. Don't tell him I told you though, he... Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe
SARA	What?
JOE	You said you were his mom.
SARA	Uh huh.
JOE	He told me you're not. This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.
SARA	He said that?
JOE	If he's not your son who is he? He's my son. I had Cid when I was twenty two. But I didn't want to give up my life. In the city. The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes.
SARA (CONT'D)	So I dropped Cid with my mom, here. And my sister. And they saw how I was living and they took him. My sister raised him here, she loved him. He called her mom.
JOE	How'd she get killed? When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.
JOE (CONT'D)	Cid told me. You have to talk to him about it. Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare.
SARA	I told you one thing, I told you to stay away from my son.
JOE	He asked about my gun. You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow
SARA	Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away from my son. She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette. And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by. Jesus it can't be. Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes, She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
SUZIE	Sorry, I know I promised five, you know how it gets.
GIRL NEIGHBOR	Don't worry sugar. She was no problem. Gat men searched through here, lookin for god knows... Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
SARA	Where does 56 go? Good. 21.
CID	How long can you not sleep?
SARA	I don't know, awhile. That's a good question. Where's it go. Good, there. 32.
CID	We should help Joe watch.
SARA	Joe?
CID	Cause he can't stay awake all the time.
SARA	He isn't our business.
CID	He's keeping us safe
SARA	Baby. Let's do this now. You have 32 there, I know you know this one.
CID	I want to help him. Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.
SARA	Cid. 32. She goes to the window, looks out, nervous. Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.
SARA (CONT'D)	No. Eight times three is what?
CID	Thirty two.
SARA	Eight times three is what?
CID	Thirty two.
SARA	I want you to count three eights.
CID	Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.
SARA	Are you telling me you want alone time?
CID	No.
SARA	Okay. Why don't you put that where it belongs? Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back
SARA (CONT'D)	Alone time. Then like a knife in a fist fight:
CID	He's protecting us cause you can't do it.
SARA	Ok. I told you to stay away from
CID	I never did anything
SARA	Do you think I'm stupid?
CID	So?
SARA	I told you already Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.
CID	So?
SARA	You do what I tell you
CID	You can't tell me what to do you're not my mom. You're not my mom! You're a liar and you're gonna get killed and you won't stop lying! Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back. Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.
CID	You're a liar! Liar! I hate you because you're lying! I hate you! Liar! You're lying to me! Sara scoots back.
CID	You're lying! Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens. The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the
KID BLUE	Hey Can. Can. Canady sees him, jumps and yelps. The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car.
CANADY	Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the
KID BLUE	Pull into that alley.
CANADY	You get the fuck outta
KID BLUE	You don't wanna be seen with me Canady, pull in the alley. Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley,
CANADY	The fuck are you still doing in town, Abe wants you dead man
KID BLUE	All Abe wants right now is the looper. Unless he got him last night?
CANADY	Jssshhh. No we didn't get him. Spotted and lost him. West End, near Whore's Alley.
KID BLUE	Whore's Alley?
CANADY	That area, Mott & Talbott, little working girl colony.
KID BLUE	Whore's Alley..
CANADY	You shoulda left town man.
KID BLUE	I'm gonna bring him in, get right with Abe.
CANADY	Yeah, maybe you bring him the looper, but short of that Abe don't get right with priced men.
KID BLUE	I got a price?
CANADY	Big one. Canady locks the car doors. And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his
CANADY (CONT'D)	Course I'd never turn a friend for The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake
JESSE	Evenin ma'am.
SARA	Evenin. How can I help you? Joe is nowhere in sight.
JESSE	You can start by accepting my apologies re the hour, I hope I didn't catch you in supper.
SARA	No, that's fine.
JESSE	Yours was the last house on my list today, been walking between empty farms all day in the hot sun. Thought I'd tick this off my list, not have to come back tomorrow.
SARA	What's this about? Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.
JESSE	You alone here, ma'am?
SARA	My husband should be back from the city, any time now.
JESSE	Happy to hear. Could I trouble you for some water?
SARA	Course. I'll get some, you can take the glass with you.
JESSE	Actually ma'am, my business tonight, this ticking off the list business, it's gonna require me coming in. If that's alright. Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is
SARA	Will you tell me what this is about?
JESSE	I will, yes. Can I come in? Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun. Ma'am? Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter.
JESSE (O.S.)	I'm a deputized police officer, we're looking for an escaped criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen anyone through here the past two days, vagrants?
SARA (O.S.)	No, vagrants are always passing but nobody near the house. Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell This man, here. He's young. No. Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
JESSE	We're looking for his father too, similar look and build but late 50s. May or may not be travelling together. This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
SARA	No. She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take
JESSE	Keep em. Kids with your husband?
SARA	Yeah. Just one.
JESSE	How old?
SARA	Eight. Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe
JESSE	Thank you.
SARA	I'll show you round the grounds, then the house, then you can be on your way. Sara holds the screen door open for him.
JESSE	We'll start with the house. Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.
JESSE	Eight, you said? Boy? And your husband. Just gotta, check in. With the home office. This goddamn thing.
SARA	This man dangerous?
JESSE	Tween you me and a lamppost? No. Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My boss has half the city's looking for him. Half the city and me. So. And if you find him, there's a helluva price. Think on that if he comes by, acting sweet. Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day. Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.
JESSE (CONT'D)	Alright, show me upstairs. The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks
SARA	Drafts, in the house. Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant
JESSE (O.S.)	This door doesn't latch?
SARA (O.S.)	It used to, it's busted. Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.
JESSE	Drafty house.
SARA	Farm house. Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.
JESSE	What's down there?
SARA	Laundry room. Door must've blown open. Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.
JESSE	Two things. First, I have a family of my own back in the city, and I want to see them again. Second if anything happens to me, and I don't report back to my boss people in fifteen minutes, they're gonna know I disappeared searching this house, and inside of another fifteen you'll have an army of more me's kicking down your door. Ok?
SARA	It's a laundry room. Jesse motions - her first.
JESSE	You want to call out whoever's hiding in that hamper?
SARA	If someone was hiding in the house, that's what I'd do. But nobody is in the house. Open it up.
JESSE	No I think I'm gonna put a shot through it just to be safe. He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.
JESSE (CONT'D)	You wanna call him out? Sara stays silent. A long beat. Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
SARA	Now if you promise not to wag your gun at my shoe rack I'll show you upstairs then show you the fuck out. She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the
CID	My granddad built it, but he didn't tell anyone of us why. Nanna said cuz he was nuts.
JOE	Thank you granddad.
CID	That wasn't the man.
JOE	No. I know him, that's what's funny. His name's Jesse. I like him. He'll go away when he doesn't find me, he won't hurt her. They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse
JOE (CONT'D)	My mom gave me up. I was younger than you. We were vagrants, and she was alone, for a long time I thought she was stupid for getting on the drug she was on, it was bad stuff, it probably ended up killing her. But now I see, she was so alone. And it was what she had. She sold me. To a panhandle gang. QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into
JOE (CONT'D)	But I got away. And I ran and I ended on a train, sitting in the dark in an empty freight, going to the city, and I saw myself over and over killing those men who bought me and who got my mom on what she was on. Finding them and tearing them apart. Saving my mom.
CID	But you didn't.
JOE	A man in the city found me, put a gun in my hand, and gave me some things. I didn't have my mom anymore. I had my work, my money. My plans. For my life. That's what I'd kill for. Not something I don't have, and can't ever get back. There's just men figuring out what they'd do to keep what's theirs, what they got. That's the only kind of man there is.
CID	I'm not gonna let Sara get killed. Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but
JOE	I think we're clear. He opens the trap door, climbs out. He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out. Sara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,
KID BLUE	All working girls, yeah?
SUPER	Uh huh. This whole block. You wanna check those too, I can arrange.
KID BLUE	I do. On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from âLo Joe. Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.
SUPER	I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha. But you don't see what you wanna see, no refunds. Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.
OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)	But I will. You want to, I know that. But you won't. I'd do anything for you.
WIFE (IN FRENCH)	You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd take life for me. But I don't want that. You kill for what you love, but someone loves the person you kill, and it starts again. I don't want that. I can't love a killer. What would you give up for me? That's yours?
OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)	Anything. She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds
OLD JOE	Anything. He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door
JOE	What? Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head
SARA	Don't wake Cid. She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain
LATER	Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.
JOE	That's pretty good.
SARA	In the city, young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters, I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but I'd keep their quarters down. One guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up. He's you. Your loop. You lied to me. She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up.
SARA (CONT'D)	But you protected Cid. And I know you're not lying that you're gonna kill this guy, your own self. Even though he's protecting your future.
JOE	He's protecting his future. Not mine. A beat.
SARA	When I came back, after my sister died. Cid was sitting on the porch, I remember seeing him for the first time, in two years.
SARA (CONT'D)	Saw him on the porch. I drove up crying and I had been at a party in the city when I got the call, I was wearing this ridiculous party dress. All my ridiculous shit. I don't know if he remembered me, but he looked at me. I abandoned him. I abandoned my baby. Maybe I can't be a mother to him, is that something I can't get back. When he looked at me then, on the porch, he was mine again, he was my son. I seen so many men in the city, who I look in their eyes and they're lost. Whether he loves me back or not I'm gonna love my son I said. And he's never gonna get lost. Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying.
OLD JOE	Don't. Don't wake up your daughter. Old Joe trains the gun on her. She goes silent.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)	Sit down. At the kitchen table. Quivering, she does. He keeps the gun Do you know me?
SUZIE	No. I don't know you. Who are you?
OLD JOE	I need to tell you why I'm doing this. I gotta say it out loud to someone so I know.
SUZIE	Why you're doing what?
SARA (O.S.)	Joe. Joe. He wakes. She is calling him from downstairs.
JESSE	Lo' Joe.
JOE	Jesse.
OLD JOE	I threw my gun away once. To get her love. And I was going to do it again, now. Because I know she'd want me to. I was going to do it. And I saw then, I saw her vanishing, like how life probably goes when you die. That's what she was asking me to give up this time.
SUZIE	...who are you?
OLD JOE	And if I picked up the gun. If I made this sacrifice. Life, my life. Absolution. Given back to me. My love. Given back, just like we were, and she wouldn't know what I did to get it back.
JOE	I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her go. Sara, Jesse here's the best shot with a gat I've ever seen, when he lets you go you sit on the couch and don't do anything stupid. Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe. He's coming here Jess. My Looper, is gonna come here.
JESSE	I gotta take you in man.
JOE	I got eighty large in pure gold, I take my looper back in and get right with Abe, whatever he gives me back I'll split it with you.
JESSE	Was that your plan?
JOE	Ok. It's yours, all of it
JESSE	Are you delusional?
OLD JOE	Everything set right. Everything fixed. Through this sacrifice.
SUZIE	What are you gonna do? Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall. Suzie screams
SUZIE (CONT'D)	No! And runs at him but he shoves her back hard.
JESSE	I know you got no options you take the one you got but Joe, you aint gettin right with no one. Looper or no, you're beyond saving. As long as Abe's got one Gat Man standing, he'll be hunting you till his dying day. Joe's face falling.
JESSE	We're going now. We're gonna go to my truck, you're gonna CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel Everything slows down. Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with Bigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND. Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and
OLD JOE	The Rainmaker. A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on. Kid Blue kicks him in the face.
GAT MAN 1	He's there. Lost his signal five minutes ago, right after he sent word he had him. Joe. Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank.
ABE	Call everyone, every Gat Man in the city, call âem here. Gather em all up here first. No mistakes this time. We're gonna take an army to that farm, all at once, and sweep it like hellfire. Now. Joe stirs first. Stands shakily. The front door jam is
SARA	Cid! Cid!
JOE (O.S.)	Cid! Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn.
SARA	What are you doing with those guns? What are you going to do? She lunges for him, wild. Wrenches his arm and he spins,
JOE	How did your sister die? Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and
JOE (CONT'D)	That happened to her. Cid. Jesus. Jesus he killed her This breaks Sara out of her sobs
SARA	No! No he was climbing a bookshelf, it fell back on him. He has no control, he gets scared, it explodes.
JOE	What is it a TK mutation?
SARA	Joe someday he'll learn to control it.
JOE	Yeah I know he will. Imagine what he could do.
SARA	If he did good with it! If he grew up good!
JOE	He doesn't. Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on
SARA	You stay away from him! Cid! Cid! She runs into the corn.
SARA	Cid! Make a noise baby, call to me! Cid! WITH JOE through the corn, following traces of blood on the
SARA (O.S.) (CONT'D)	You stay away from Joe, you come to me! Cid! Tries cocking the GAT but it's broken. Tosses it, wields the Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and
JOE	Right now two things have happened. My looper knows Cid's the kid he's looking for, and my gang knows I'm here. So in fifteen minutes one or both is coming down that highway. You pack up the Gat Man's truck, whatever you can fit in ten minutes, and you drive North away from the city.
SARA	Where are you going? Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it.
JOE	One buzz means come and get me. Two or nothing, don't. He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway.
GAT MAN 1	We got everyone here. All our men.
ABE	Arm âem up, let's go. BUZZZZ. Abe turns, annoyed, and sees the security monitor.
KID BLUE (ON SPEAKER)	I got him Abe. I got him.
ABE	Well. Shhhhhit. Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the
BIG CRAIG	Hoh. So both we got?
KID BLUE	Just the Looper. I got him. Knew he went for whores, so I checked every building.
BIG CRAIG	They found Joe too though, in a farm on the east side. That's why all the Gats are here, the whole crew's arming up to make a sweep.
KID BLUE	Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I got the Looper. Not such a fuck up huh? I'm taking him up to This happens very fast: Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down. And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door
ABE	Joe. Guess I put the gun in that kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess everything comes back around. Like your goddamn ties. Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.
SARA	Ok baby, we're going. Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
OLD JOE	Bon jour. You take this truck, you take your money, and you go live your life. No one's coming after you. I fixed it.
JOE	And you go kill the boy. That's how you fix it.
OLD JOE	That's how. You got your life back, you better think right now about what that's worth to you.
JOE	My life? Your life. Becoming you. Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
OLD JOE	Stupid little shit! You let him live, he's gonna take away everything that's yours, everything that's mine! You seen what the boy's gonna become.
JOE	I haven't seen that yet. Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss. Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe. Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud. In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him. A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head. Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue. Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:
SARA	Here we go. Give it a wave goodbye.
SARA	Duck down baby
CID	Stop please he can shoot us
SARA	Just stay down Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot
CID	Stop! The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.
SARA	Are you ok?
CID	I'm sorry In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.
SARA	You're ok. C'mon baby we have to run now. She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets
SARA (CONT'D)	We're going into the fields. I want you to run, I'll be right behind you, don't look back. Okay? Old Joe lowers his gun and runs towards them.
SARA (CONT'D)	Go! They both sprint off the road.
NO!	Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.
SARA (CONT'D)	No Cid no! The topsoil of the earth around them RISES in a fine dust. Cid raises his head. The bullet grazed his jawline. Not Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe. Blood soaks his shirt.
SARA	No! With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a Sara lifts into the air. Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word
MOM	And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes Joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for Too far.
SARA	You did good, baby. You did so good. I love you. Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.
SARA (CONT'D)	Into the fields. Run now baby. Go.
CID	No no mom no
SARA	You go! She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing
OLD JOE	Move! No time to move around Sara. Now or never.
JOE	No!
OLD JOE	I'm sorry He pulls the trigger. We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision. And Old Joe DISAPPEARS. Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.
CID	Where's Joe?
SARA	He had to go away, baby.
CID	He took the bad man with him? She kisses him. She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.
