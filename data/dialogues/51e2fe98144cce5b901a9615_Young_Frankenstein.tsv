CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
FIRST VILLAGER (WALTER)	Fumbling fool! For two kronen I'd rip that box fight out of his hands.
ILSE (HIS WIFE)	Shhh!
NINETY-YEAR-OLD VILLAGER (HENRICH)	Hurry. Idiot, hurry!
AGATHA (HIS WIFE)	Quiet, Henrich! We've waited seventy years... another three or four seconds won't hurt.
NINETY-YEAR-OLD VILLAGER	Another three of four more seconds? I could be dead by then.
AGATHA	Shhh!
FIFTH VILLAGER (A MAN)	What if he's left you out?
HELENE (HIS GIRL FRIEND)	Just let him try -- I'll take care of him.
ANASTASIA (A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)	Oh, Mommy...I hardly remember. Did the Baron really like me when I was a child?
MARLENE (HER MOTHER)	Like a father!
NINTH VILLAGER (WOLFGANG)	Wenn dieser Bloder kerl sich nicht beeilt verde ich verruckt. Was zum Teufel machte?
MARLENE	Shhh!
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	'I, Beaufort Frankenstein, in this my eighty third year of life, do hereby make, publish and declare the following statements as and for my last will and testament, and I direct my executor, Cornelius Waldman, to inform and assemble those persons previously divulged to him, that they may hear -- in my own voice -- the final disposition of my property.'
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	'Such disposition to commerce at the hour of twelve o'clock of my one hundredth birthday. If all the conditions heretofore set forth have been met, now then -- hear once more, and for the last time...the authenticity of my own voice!'
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	How do you do this thing? Where? In here? Just talk right into it? All right. Am I close enough? All right, all right -- get the hell out of the way. The once proud name of Frankenstein has been dragged, by my only son, Victor, into an abyss of shame. There was a time when the name 'Frankenstein' conjured dreams of virtue, of honor and devotion. Now, no guilt, no malignity, no misery can be found to equal mine. And the catalogue of sins of my once devoted son will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever -- so supremely frightful is the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. Did you get all that? Are you sure you got 'rankle in my wounds'? I'll kill you if you screw this up. All right, all right. Now as to the disposition of my estate.
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	To my cousins, Henrich and Agatha...
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	...and to my cousin Walter and his wife Ilse...
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	...and to my niece Helene...
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	...and my dear nephew Wolfgang...
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	...and lastly, to my cherished old friend, Marlene, and her charming daughter, Anastasia...
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	...to all of you, in equal shares, I hereby give, devise and bequeath, absolutely and without any restrictions whatsoever, all property of every sort and description, whether real, personal or mixed, to which my estate shall be entitled.
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	Unless...!
HERR FALKSTEIN	It's a seventy eight.
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	...Unless... my only male heir, my great-grandson, Frederick -- whom I have never seen but who is, at the time of this recording, ten years of age and residing in America with my granddaughter, Katherine -- has, by his own free will, embraced Medicine as his career and acquitted himself with some measure of esteem. Then, to him I leave... everything!
VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN	My castle, together with its laboratory, its public and private library, and all notes and journals contained therein, all acreage surrounding my estate, plus all income and principle thereof... in the fond hope that yet another Frankenstein shall lift our family name to an eminence of dignity, and sanity, that it once enjoyed. As for my dear friends and relations, should this latter improbability come to be... I know that I have your complete understanding. For the road to salvation and repentance must be paved up the avenue of my soul, and not up yours, up yours, up yours, up yours, up yours...
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein! Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
HERR FALKSTEIN	I did, sir.
HERR FALKSTEIN	But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
HERR FALKSTEIN	'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
ANASTASIA	Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting. But is Frederick, then... a medical doctor?
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Yes, my dear, he is.
ANASTASIA	And has he achieved... any special degree of eminence?
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
ANASTASIA	Oh, shit.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance. The estate will provide for your journey.
HELENE	I object, Herr Waldman! This is a travesty. If the beloved great- grandson cared anything at all for the House of Frankenstein, he would have shown it by being here with those of us who still have some respect. I think we should completely disregard the afterthoughts of a very old man.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Madam -- the foundation of civilization rests upon adherence to the law. And the Law is the Law. Das Gesetz ist das Gesetz!
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed... and by God, it shall be done!
LECTURER'S VOICE	If we look at the base of a brain which has just been removed from a skull, there's very little of the midbrain that we can actually see.
LECTURER'S VOICE	Yet, as I demonstrated in my lecture last week, if the under aspects of the temporal lobes are gently pulled apart, the upper portion of the stem of the brain can be seen.
LECTURER'S VOICE	This so called 'brain stem' consists of the midbrain, a rounded protrusion called the pons, and a stalk tapering downwards called the medulla oblongata which passes out of the skull through the foramen magnum and becomes, of course... the spinal cord.
LECTURER'S VOICE	Which brings us directly to the demonstration prepared for today. Are there any questions before we proceed?
MEDICAL STUDENT	I have one question, Dr. Frankenstein.
FREDDY	That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
MEDICAL STUDENT	I beg your pardon?
FREDDY	My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
MEDICAL STUDENT	Oh! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
FREDDY	No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
MEDICAL STUDENT	But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
FREDDY	That's true! But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
FREDDY	I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science. Now if we can proceed to your questions.
MEDICAL STUDENT	Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
FREDDY	Very good! Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
FREDDY	What are we actually talking about when we use the term, 'Brain'? We are talking about... a cauliflower!
FREDDY	May I have the cauliflower, please!
FREDDY	If we make a small slit, down the center of this cauliflower...
FREDDY	...and then, ever so gently, gently, gently... pull it apart...
FREDDY	...we should find, with any luck at all... a stalk of... celery!
FREDDY	Where did you get this cauliflower?
CARLSON	From your office, sir.
FREDDY	Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
CARLSON	Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
FREDDY	Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
CARLSON	No, sir. It will never happen again.
FREDDY	Here! This cauliflower is useless to me.
FREDDY	With any normal cauliflower, we would have found a stalk of celery, or... 'Brain Stem' which brings us to the practical application of our study.
FREDDY	Mr. Hilltop here -- with whom I have never worked of given any prior instructions to -- has graciously offered his services for this afternoon's demonstration. Mr. Hilltop!
HILLTOP	Yes, sir?
FREDDY	Have we ever seen each other before this afternoon?
HILLTOP	No, sir.
FREDDY	Tell them!
HILLTOP	No, sir -- we haven't.
FREDDY	Do I lie? Would you be so kind enough to hop up on your feet and stand beside this table.
FREDDY	Mr. Hilltop! Would you raise your left knee, please!
FREDDY	You have just witnessed a 'Voluntary' nerve impulse. It begins as a stimulus from the cerebral cortex, passes through the brain stem and then to the particular muscle involved. Mr. Hilltop, you may lower your knee.
FREDDY	Reflex movements are those which are made independently of the will, but are carried out along pathways which pass between the periphery and the central nervous system. You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a BITCH!
FREDDY	We are not aware of the impulses, neither do we intend them to contract our muscles. Yet -- as you can see -- they work by themselves.
FREDDY	Now then! Modern research has shown us that by simply applying local pressure of 'blocking' the nerve impulse... which can be done with any ordinary metal clamp...
FREDDY	...Just at the swelling on the posterior nerve root -- for, oh say five or six seconds...
FREDDY	Why you mother-grabbing BASTARD!
FREDDY	All communication is shut off.
FREDDY	...or group of muscles, with some loss of skin sensation on the area supplied by that nerve. In spite of our mechanical magnificence, if there is not this continuous stream of impulses... we would collapse like... a bunch of broccoli.
FREDDY	Give him an extra dollar.
CARLSON	Yes, sir.
FREDDY	In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fiber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it. Are there any more questions before we leave?
MEDICAL STUDENT	Dr. Fronkonsteen!
FREDDY	Yes?
MEDICAL STUDENT	Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
FREDDY	A piece of what?
MEDICAL STUDENT	Vermicelli.
FREDDY	Are you speaking of the worm, or... the spaghetti.
FREDDY	Why the worm, Sir.
FREDDY	Ah! In science you must be very precise -- it can spell the difference between life and death. I don't want that fellow in class next semester.
CARLSON	Yes, sir.
FREDDY	He has a big mouth. Yes! It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student. But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
MEDICAL STUDENT	But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
FREDDY	My father was a sick man.
MEDICAL STUDENT	But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
FREDDY	You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
MEDICAL STUDENT	Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
FREDDY	How old are you, young man?
MEDICAL STUDENT	Nineteen, sir.
FREDDY	Nineteen! My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
MEDICAL STUDENT	But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
FREDDY	Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
MEDICAL STUDENT	But, sir...
FREDDY	I am a scientist...! Not a philosopher.
FREDDY	You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
MEDICAL STUDENT	But your grandfather's work, sir...
FREDDY	My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead! There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
FREDDY	Class... is... dismissed!
FREDDY	Carlson!
CARLSON	Yes, sir?
FREDDY	Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
CARLSON	Yes, sir. Do you want the other cauliflower?
FREDDY	...No!
HERR FALKSTEIN	Dr. Frankenstein?
FREDDY	Fron kon steen!
HERR FALKSTEIN	My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
FREDDY	One hundred thousand dollars???
HERR FALKSTEIN	Oh, at least, sir. The land alone is worth a small fortune.
FREDDY	But I can't just drop everything and leave. I have responsibilities and obligations.
HERR FALKSTEIN	Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
FREDDY	How long will this whole thing take?
HERR FALKSTEIN	A week. Ten days at most.
FREDDY	I'll have to think it over. It's not so easy just to pick up and...
FREDDY	Curious melody! Haunting, isn't it?
FREDDY	What's that tune that you're playing
OLD VIOLINIST	Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
FREDDY	How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.
FREDDY	May I see your violin?
OLD VIOLINIST	It's an honor for me, sir. You play the violin?
FREDDY	Oh, just a little.
FREDDY	Nice! Nice little balance to it.
OLD VIOLINIST	Ja, ja.
FREDDY	Thank you very much.
FREDDY	Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
HERR FALKSTEIN	Why did you do that?
FREDDY	What?
HERR FALKSTEIN	Break that old man's violin.
FREDDY	I didn't do that.
HERR FALKSTEIN	The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
FREDDY	I did not do that. Why would I do a thing like that...? Are you insane?
FREDDY	All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much. You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir.
FREDDY	One week at the most!?
HERR FALKSTEIN	One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
FREDDY	Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
HERR FALKSTEIN	Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
FREDDY	Saturday night then! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
HERR FALKSTEIN	Saturday night, yes, sir. Have a pleasant journey!
ELIZABETH	Darling!... you will be careful!?
FREDDY	Of course.
ELIZABETH	You have your tickets?
FREDDY	Yes.
ELIZABETH	And your passport?
FREDDY	Yes, don't worry.
ELIZABETH	Call me from New York before you leave??
FREDDY	Yes.
ELIZABETH	Promise??
FREDDY	I promise.
ELIZABETH	Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
FREDDY	Oh, darling -- so will I.
CONDUCTOR	Board! All aboard!
FREDDY	I'd better leave.
ELIZABETH	Will you miss me?
FREDDY	Very.... very!
ELIZABETH	Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
FREDDY	Oh, nice.
ELIZABETH	I hope you like large weddings.
FREDDY	Whatever makes you happy.
ELIZABETH	I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends... but it still comes to three thousand.
FREDDY	You're incorrigible!
ELIZABETH	Does that mean you love me?
FREDDY	You bet your boots it does.
CONDUCTOR	All aboard!
ELIZABETH	Hurry now -- before I make a fool of myself.
FREDDY	Goodbye, darling.
ELIZABETH	Goodbye, Freddy! Hurry back to me!
FREDDY	I will! Goodbye, darling!
ELIZABETH	Goodbye, darling.
ELIZABETH	Goodbye, darling.
FREDDY	Goodbye, darling!
CONDUCTOR	New York next! Everyone out for New York!
CONDUCTOR	Transylvania nachste! Jeder austeigen fur TRANSYLVANIA!
FREDDY	Pardon me, boy! Is that the Transylvania Station?
GERMAN BOY	Ja, this is track twenty-nine.
GERMAN BOY	Oh, can I give you a shine?
FREDDY	Thank you, no.
IGOR	Frederick Frankenstein?
FREDDY	Fron kon steen!
IGOR	Are you putting me on?
FREDDY	No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
IGOR	And do you also say Fro dereck?
FREDDY	No, Fred ereck.
IGOR	Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
FREDDY	It's not. It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
IGOR	I see.
FREDDY	You must be Igor.
IGOR	No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
FREDDY	But they told me it was Ee gor.
IGOR	Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
FREDDY	You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
IGOR	Yes, that's right. My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together. You and I should have a lot of laughs.
FREDDY	I'm sure we will.
IGOR	This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
FREDDY	How do you do?
INGA	Extremely well.
FREDDY	How nice.
IGOR	Are these your bags?
FREDDY	Yes, just the two.
INGA	Did you have a pleasant trip?
FREDDY	Yes, thank you. It wasn't bad.
IGOR	Sun -- rise... Sun -- set! Dee -- dum... Dee -- dum.
FREDDY	Good evening.
DRACULA	Good evening.
WOLFMAN	Good evening.
INGA	Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
FREDDY	I'm not sure I... get your drift.
INGA	You should try it -- it's fun.
FREDDY	Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
IGOR	What hump?
FREDDY	Well... perhaps we can talk about it later.
INGA	Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
FREDDY	Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
FREDDY	Werewolf.
IGOR	There.
FREDDY	I beg your pardon?
IGOR	There wolf! There castle!
FREDDY	Why are you talking like that?
IGOR	I thought you wanted to.
FREDDY	No.
IGOR	Suit yourself... I'm easy. Better watch out for the wockers.
FREDDY	What wockers?
IGOR	The wockers with the knockers.
FREDDY	Wockers with the knockers???
IGOR	Go ahead, play dumb! You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
IGOR	Well, there it is...
IGOR	Home!
FREDDY	Home.
FRAU BLUCHER	Welcome! I am Frau Blucher.
IGOR	Down! Down! Steady!!
FREDDY	How do you do? I am Dr. Fronkonsteen.
IGOR	Down! Get down, you beasts!
FREDDY	I wonder what's got into them?
FRAU BLUCHER	Your rooms are ready, Herr Doctor. If you will follow me, please.
FREDDY	Aye-gor! We'll wait for you inside. Hurry, please!
FREDDY	After you Frau Blucher.
IGOR	Easy. Easy! What's very sticky and rhymes with shoe?
IGOR	That's better.
IGOR	I'll be back shortly. Just think of model airplanes.
FRAU BLUCHER	Shall we proceed?
FRAU BLUCHER	I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
FREDDY	It seems fine.
FRAU BLUCHER	You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring. I'll leave it on the table here.
FREDDY	Does that include the key to the laboratory?
FRAU BLUCHER	You mean... the laboratory??
FREDDY	Yes!... the laboratory.
FRAU BLUCHER	No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
FREDDY	May I have it, please?
FRAU BLUCHER	Of course.
FREDDY	There seem to be quite a few books.
FRAU BLUCHER	Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
FREDDY	I see. And where is my grandfather's private library?
FRAU BLUCHER	I don't know what you mean, sir.
FREDDY	Well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will. These books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
FRAU BLUCHER	This is the only library I know of.
FREDDY	Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
FRAU BLUCHER	I think you must be mistaken, sir.
FREDDY	Well... we'll see.
FRAU BLUCHER	Will there be anything else?
FREDDY	I don't think so. Is my assistant taken care of?
FRAU BLUCHER	I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
FREDDY	Good.
INGA	Are you busy?
FREDDY	That's quite all right. What is it, dear?
INGA	Could I lie down in your bed for a little while? I just can't sleep.
FREDDY	We only arrived a few minutes ago.
INGA	I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away. It must be the strange room.
FREDDY	Well...
INGA	Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
FREDDY	Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
FREDDY	Would you like a sandwich?
INGA	No, thanks! I want to get right to sleep.
FREDDY	Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
FREDDY	Stop it. Stop it, I tell you I don't want to be perfect. Can't you understand that? I don't want to be perfect!
FREDDY	Inga!
INGA	Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
FREDDY	Inga, wake up!
INGA	What is it? Is something wrong, Doctor?
FREDDY	Listen! Don't you hear that strange music?
INGA	Yes! What could it be at this hour?
FREDDY	I don't know. It just woke me up.
FREDDY	It seem to be coming from behind this bookcase.
FREDDY	Hand me one of those candles!
INGA	Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
FREDDY	Whatever it is, it's coming from down there. I'm going down to see.
INGA	Let me come with you, Doctor, please! I don't want to stay up here alone.
FREDDY	All right then, quietly! Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound! BY ORDER OF: FIRE DEPT.
FREDDY	Aye-gor!
IGOR	Fro-derick!
FREDDY	What are you doing here?
IGOR	I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
FREDDY	But what you were doing?
IGOR	Just putting up some tea.
FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music??
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music?
IGOR	No, not sound.
INGA	There must have been someone else down here then.
FREDDY	It seems that way. You didn't hear any music at all?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
IGOR	Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
IGOR	Well, it's all right for atmosphere.
INGA	Ooh!
FREDDY	What a filthy mess.
IGOR	I don't know... a little paint, some flowers...
FREDDY	Did you see anyone else down here?
IGOR	No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
INGA	Look, Doctor!
FREDDY	Well, this explains the music.
INGA	But who was playing it?
FREDDY	I don't know, but whoever it was barely finished putting out his cigar. It's still smoldering. Let me smell your breath.
FREDDY	Well, it wasn't you.
FREDDY	What is this place?
IGOR	Must be the music room.
INGA	There's nothing but books and papers.
FREDDY	I wonder...
FREDDY	It is! This was my grandfather's private library. Look at this!
IGOR	'How I Did It.' Good title!
FREDDY	Funny it should just be lying out here on the table. I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
FREDDY	'Whence, I often asked myself, did the principles of life proceed? To examine the causes of life... we must first have recourse to death.' God, what a looney bin!
INGA	Oh, doctor!
FREDDY	Perhaps we'd better leave.
IGOR	Taking the book along?
FREDDY	Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
FREDDY	This guy is too much.
FREDDY	'...and as soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak tree had disappeared. I knew then that electricity and galvanism had changed my life.'
FREDDY	This guy is bonkers! Did you ever hear anything like this??
FREDDY'S VOICE	'When I look back now, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous event obliterated any last effort by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars.'
FREDDY'S VOICE	He kills me! This guy kills me.
FREDDY'S VOICE	'Until, from the midst of this darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me -- a light so brilliant and wondrous, and yet so simple!'
FREDDY	'Change the poles from plus to minus and from minus to plus!'
FREDDY	'I alone succeeded in discovering the cause of generation of life.'
FREDDY	'Nay, even more -- I, myself became capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.'
FREDDY	It could work!! DESTINY OF ALL THOSE WHO BEAR THE NAME OF 'FRANKENSTEIN'
FREDDY	'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course! That would simplify everything.
INGA	And look at this, Doctor!
FREDDY	'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
IGOR	His what??
INGA	His schwanzstucker.
IGOR	Whew! A nineteen-inch drill.
FREDDY	Now then! What we're aiming for, is a being about eight feet in height, and all features proportionably large.
IGOR	Something like this?
FREDDY'S VOICE	You've caught something there. Yes! As a matter of fact -- I think -- that this -- might -- be -- our -- man!
EXECUTIONER	Have anything to say?
THE BODY	MMmmmgrrrrrrrrr!
EXECUTIONER	Anything else?
THE BODY	Go shove it up your --
FATHER	He was a good man.
MOTHER	He was an angel.
FATHER	He was a saint!
MOTHER	She had to marry this rotten pig instead.
FATHER	Hanging was too good -- they should have soaked him in lye.
FIRST GRAVE DIGGER	What a filthy job!
SECOND GRAVE DIGGER	Could be worse!
FREDDY	What a filthy job!
IGOR	Could be worse!
FREDDY	How?
IGOR	Could be raining!
FREDDY	Wait! Let's tip the coffin over, then just lift it off. It'll be much easier.
FREDDY	Now...
FREDDY	Set it down!
FREDDY	Magnificent!
FREDDY	Very little decay. With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain. You know what to do!
IGOR	I have a pretty good idea.
FREDDY	Do you have the name I wrote down?
IGOR	Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
FREDDY	I want that brain.
IGOR	Was he any good?
FREDDY	Was he any good??? He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
IGOR	Hmm!
FREDDY	And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
IGOR	That's not bad.
FREDDY	Can you imagine that brain in this body?
IGOR	I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
FREDDY	He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now. I'll prepare the body.
IGOR	Oh! May I call you 'Master'?
FREDDY	Why?
IGOR	It's always been one of my favorite names.
FREDDY	If you like -- just hurry!
IGOR	Thank you, Master.
FREDDY	Look at this hand! Look at these fingers! AFTER 5:00 P.M. SHOVE BRAIN THROUGH SLOT IN DOOR
LAWRENCE TALBOT	
HANS DELBRUCK	
IGOR	Funny thing is... I tried!
IGOR	Freud would have a heyday with this. Well...
FREDDY	Finished!
INGA	What a beautiful job!
FREDDY	Ready?? 'Looking back now, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous event obliterated any last effort by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars.'
IGOR	You're sure you know what you're doing?
FREDDY	Yes! It's all written down in the notes. Tie off the kites and come down!
IGOR	Yes, master. Just don't turn on any radios.
FREDDY	Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
INGA	Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
FREDDY	A god?
INGA	Yes!
FREDDY	I know.
IGOR	You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
FREDDY	All right... elevate me!
INGA	Right here?
FREDDY	Raise the platform, hurry!
INGA	Oh! Yes, Doctor.
FREDDY	The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing. We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature. We shall ascend into the Heavens. We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
IGOR	Tonight?
FREDDY	Yes! When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
IGOR	You've got it, master.
FREDDY	Get ready!
FREDDY	Get set!
FREDDY	Go!!
FREDDY	Throw the second switch!
IGOR	This guy means business.
FREDDY	It's not enough. More! More, do you hear me?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	More, do you hear me?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	Throw the third switch!
IGOR	Wait till he sees the bill.
FREDDY	All right -- turn everything off and bring me down!
FREDDY	Nothing!
FREDDY	Reputation. Reputation!
INGA	I thought it was wonderful.
FREDDY	I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
IGOR	You can't win 'em all.
FREDDY	But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
INGA	Pass the Wildschweinbraten mit Gewurzgurkensosse, please.
FREDDY	Let's look once more. I can't stand just sitting here doing nothing. Maybe we left to soon.
FREDDY	Cold! Cold and dead!
IGOR	You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
FREDDY	Don't try to cheer me up that way.
IGOR	Well, I don't like to see you mope.
IGOR	You'll be getting me sad next.
FREDDY	I'm sorry. I don't mean to take out my frustration on you. You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
IGOR	I'm not that sort you know. I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
FREDDY	You're right! Self-pity never got anyone anywhere. Let's go back and finish our dinner.
IGOR	What is this?
FREDDY	Schwartzwalder Kirschtorte.
FREDDY	Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
IGOR	Who are you talking to?
FREDDY	To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
IGOR	I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
FREDDY	But you did -- I just heard it.
IGOR	It wasn't me.
INGA	It wasn't me.
FREDDY	Look here -- if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
FREDDY	It's alive!
INGA	Oh, Doctor!
IGOR	I think you've done it, master.
FREDDY	Alive! Look at it. I have defeated death!
IGOR	Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
FREDDY	I suppose you're right. Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
FREDDY	It's trying to talk. It wants us to take off the straps.
IGOR	Don't fall for that one.
FREDDY	But don't you see... the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us. I've got to untie it.
IGOR	Careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
FREDDY	All right... stand back!
FREDDY	Hello there.
MONSTER	MMMMMmmmmmmm.
FREDDY	How's everything?
MONSTER	MMMmmmmmmmm.
FREDDY	I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MONSTER	MMMmmmm! MMMmmmm!
FREDDY	Yes, I'm going to set you free. Is the sedative ready?
INGA	Yes, Doctor.
MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm.
FREDDY	It's alive. It's -- moving! It's -- breathing! It's -- standing! What is your name?
MONSTER	...It's.
IGOR	Original.
FREDDY	Give -- me -- your -- hand!
FREDDY	Whew! I'm glad that's over with.
IGOR	You can say that again.
FREDDY	Yes.
IGOR	You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
FREDDY	Why?
IGOR	What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
FREDDY	I'm not trying to be funny.
IGOR	Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
FREDDY	...I'm glad that's...
IGOR	No, no! That whole thing!
FREDDY	...Whew! I'm glad that's over with.
MONSTER	MMMMmmmmmmmmm!
IGOR	See what I mean?
MONSTER	MMMmmm! MMMmmm!
INGA	I think 'It' wants to do it again Doctor.
FREDDY	It looks that way.
INGA	What do you think we should do?
MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
FREDDY	Oh... let's do it a little more.
MONSTER	MMMmmm!
MONSTER	MMMMmmmmm! MMMMmmmmm!
FREDDY	Stop that! Now just stop that this instant and listen to me!
FREDDY	I have given you one of the finest minds of this century. You are a brilliant endocrinologist. You are a superb scientist. And you are making naughty! Now that's enough. Finished! From now on, you will behave like a man, and not a spoiled, snot-nosed, sniveling brat who thinks he can get anything he wants by bullying people with sheer brute force.
IGOR	This fellow's got great timing.
INGA	Oh, Doctor -- be careful!
MONSTER	Mmmmmm! Mmmmmm!
INGA	Doctor! There's that strange music again. What could it be?
IGOR	It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
FREDDY	Ayegor! Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
IGOR	Yes, Master!
FREDDY	Act casual!
IGOR	Care for a jujubee?
FREDDY	Clever ploy!
IGOR	NO movies together for us -- that's for sure.
INGA	It's almost as if he were afraid. He loves that music.
INGA	I think he wants you to carry him, Doctor.
INGA	What are you going to do?
FREDDY	I think I'll... carry him.
MONSTER	MMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
INGA	Doctor! The music has stopped.
FREDDY	Do you think you can sing it?
INGA	Me? Sing?
FREDDY	Yes -- quickly, dear!
INGA	I'd be so nervous.
FREDDY	This is not the finals -- just sing!
INGA	It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti- nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub- tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
INGA	Be-cause it does what you want it to do.
MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
INGA	It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen- tal...'
FREDDY	Stop -- singing!!!
IGOR	How's it going?
FREDDY	What did you find out?
IGOR	Someone was playing this in the music room.
FREDDY	Where is he?
IGOR	How do you know it was a 'he'?
FREDDY	All right -- where is she?
IGOR	How do you know it was a 'she'?
FREDDY	Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
IGOR	Can you play it?
FREDDY	Maybe... if you get here on time.
INGA	It's working! Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
IGOR	Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
FREDDY	Get the sedative ready!
MONSTER	MMmmm! Mmmmm!
INGA	I think he wants to be tucked in.
FREDDY	Get a blanket from under that shelf!
FREDDY	All right -- give it to him!
INGA	Are you serious??
FREDDY	Give him the sedative!
INGA	Oh! Yes, Doctor.
IGOR	He's got quite a tush.
FREDDY	Did you do it?
INGA	I think so.
FREDDY	Good! It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
MONSTER	MMMMmmmmmmmm!
INGA	I'm getting tired.
IGOR	Why don't we all turn in? It's been a long day.
FREDDY	Wait -- I'm sure he's out by now. That shot was strong enough to stop a horse.
IGOR	See you at breakfast, then!
INGA	Good night, Doctor.
FREDDY	Good night!
FREDDY	Thanks... for all your help.
IGOR	That's what we're paid for.
FREDDY	This song. This haunting melody. This ancient, quaintly atonal folk tune... is driving -- me -- crackers! I can't go on -- do you understand?? Can NOT go on playing this pathogenically rotten song. If you're not asleep yet, then kill me if you have to, but at the count of three... I stop! One!... Incidentally, I was thinking of making a big breakfast tomorrow -- blueberry waffles and crisp bacon. Two!... By the way, I'm sorry I yelled at you before -- I must have been over-tired. Anyway, I meant to apologize and just forgot. Two!... Maybe tomorrow would be a good day just to relax -- go for a swim, maybe do a little water skiing. Well... we'll see after we finish a nice breakfast. Three!
FREDDY	Spoiled Sissy!
FREDDY	The song is over!
FREDDY	Das lied ist aus!
FREDDY	Oh! Oh my! What a strange feeling that was. My head -- I felt such a pressure, splitting my head apart. I feel so relieved and lightheaded. That horrible pressure... like voices... all calling to me, imploring me... swearing at me. Well, it's over now, thank goodness. Oh... my poor Doctor Delbruck. Doctor, Doctor... what have I done to you? Was habe ich von Dir gamacht? Your magnificent brain, locked in this... pile of... Forgive me, Doctor. I thought -- for science only. I couldn't stand the thought to mankind. I was a fool! How dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier is that man who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. Can you ever forgive me?
FREDDY	That's a knockout tune! That tune is a winner. You can't call it 'wishy- washy'... like some people I know. That song is going places. And so are we -- Blubber Boy. With your body, and the brain of that kraut -- we'll be 'Number One' in no time.
FREDDY	Right, voices?? I hear you skipping away in there. 'Do better than your father!' You're telling me I will. 'Do better than my grandfather!?' I'll make my famous grandfather look like a part-time nurse.
FREDDY	There's no stopping now. Destiny is too potent. I -- want -- perfection!
FREDDY	I want a lot of it... and the best there is.
FREDDY	Because from now on...
FREDDY	...the only act we follow is the creation of fire. I'm going to explore unknown powers... I'm going to unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation... and I'm going to make -- my -- mommy -- proud!
FREDDY	And one and two and three and four and lift -- lift, three and four and don't look sad for sympathy; you know we only stop to pee. And lift -- lift, three and four and try and not to break the floor.
FREDDY	And one and two and point your toes and two and two and stretch you thighs and three and two and lift your knees and watch that nasty temper, please.
FREDDY	And one and two and point your toes...
IGOR	And Oh-oh, Oh-oh... there he goes.
FREDDY	And oopy, not so hasty, please, and stretch your legs and lift your knees.
FREDDY	And even though we're nose to nose, Always, always point your toes! Don't knot your fists like monsters do, but light-ly, gently, pas de deux. A grateful bot who has a chance would never kill if he could dance. So take your fingers off my throat and two -- remove them from my chest and three and two, continue please; I didn't say 'It's time to rest.' Don't stand flat footed; point your toes! Don't hang your hands like some dumb clod; Always lift them gracefully, like little chil-dren praying to God. That's the way an angel grows but first he learns to POINT his TOES!
FREDDY	And one and two and stretch your thighs and two and two and lift your knees... IN "THE GREATEST DISCOVERY SINCE FIRE" Presented in Cooperation With T N S
FREDDY	And now, my fellow scientists and neurosurgeon...I must ask you to... suspend belief. For up until now, you have seen the Creature perform the simple mechanics of motor activity. That this Creature was an inanimate blob, which I endowed with the secret of life -- yes!...in all honesty -- that showed some measure of skill on my part. But for what you are about to see next... we must enter -- quietly -- into the realm of genius. I say this modestly, only because I am, myself, as in awe of the gifts I possess as if I were observing them in some other person. I think of them, only, as a loan. Grateful, of course... that my credit is good. Thus, with the accumulated knowledge of Chemistry, Electricity, Neurosurgery... and art... I now present what was once an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues. Ladies and gentlemen... Mesdames et Messieurs... Damen und Herren...The Creature!
FREDDY	If you're blue and you don't know where to go to, why don't you...
FREDDY	...go where fashion sits...
MONSTER	Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
FREDDY	Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits...
MONSTER	Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
FREDDY	Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
MONSTER	Soo -- pah doo -- per.
FREDDY	Come let's mix where Rock-e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber-el-las' in their mitts...
MONSTER	Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
FREDDY	Dressed up like a million dollar trouper. Trying hard to look like Gary Coo -- per.
FREDDY	That's your cue. Go on!
MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
FREDDY	...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock-e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber-el-las' in their mitts...
MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
FREDDY	For God's sake -- go on! Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur! Sing!!
AUDIENCE	Booooo! Get him off! Fake! What else can your toy do?
FREDDY	Fake?? You stupid idiots... you call my creation a fake??? What do you know about truth? You're the fakes! All of you! I wouldn't come to you with a hang-nail.
MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
FREDDY	Wait! Stop! Don't give them the satisfaction. I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
MONSTER	MMMmmmmmm.
FREDDY	Don't you think I know that? But what are you judging by? Bucharest??? This was always a hick town. They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here. Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you?... Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
FREDDY	I chose the wrong song.
FREDDY	I'm a failure.
IGOR	Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
INGA	Look how far we've come.
IGOR	You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
INGA	I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
IGOR	Why certainly. Don't you, Frau Blucher?
FRAU BLUCHER	He's a failure.
FREDDY	What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
FRAU BLUCHER	This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
FREDDY	Elizabeth!?! 'Can't waits any longer. Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God! Not tonight.
INGA	Why, doctor... how wonderful for you.
FREDDY	Wonderful? It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
IGOR	She sounds fascinating.
SIX-YEAR-OLD-GIRL	Mit kommen, mit kommen. Du bist immer eine schlafmutzigem blindschleiche.
ELIZABETH	Darling!
FREDDY	Darling!
ELIZABETH	Surprised?
FREDDY	Surprised!
ELIZABETH	Love me?
FREDDY	Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
ELIZABETH	Darling!?!
FREDDY	I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am. Oh! These are my assistants: Inga and Ayegor.
ELIZABETH	How do you do?
INGA	Very well. So nice to meet you at last.
IGOR	Darling!
ELIZABETH	Hello...?
IGOR	Surprised?
ELIZABETH	Well... yes.
IGOR	Miss me?
ELIZABETH	I...
FREDDY	Ready, darling?
ELIZABETH	Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.
FREDDY	Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
IGOR	Certainly, master.
ELIZABETH	What a strange fellow.
FREDDY	Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
ELIZABETH	Why does he call you 'master'?
FREDDY	Are you suggesting I call him master???
ELIZABETH	No, of course not. I just meant...
FREDDY	All right then!
MAITRE D'	Yes, sir, name, please?
MONSTER	Food!
MAITRE D'	Do you have a reservation?
MONSTER	Food!!
MAITRE D'	I'm sorry, sir. We only seat by reservation.
MONSTER	Drink!
MAITRE D'	Oh, no sir-ee. If you don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
MONSTER	Foooooood!
MAITRE D'	Now just one moment. There's no need for roughhousing. Have you ever tried a tip?
MONSTER	GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
MAITRE D'	Franz! Help! Lunatic!
FREDDY	Poor Delbruck! There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
ELIZABETH	Darling, you mustn't worry so.
FREDDY	But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships. I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
ELIZABETH	But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.
FREDDY	Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
ELIZABETH	You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
FREDDY	I suppose you're right.
ELIZABETH	Of course I am. Now come along like a good boy.
FREDDY	What would I do without you?
ELIZABETH	Is your room just down the hall? ...in case I get frightened during the night?
FREDDY	Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
ELIZABETH	Oh, darling! Don't let's spoil everything.
FREDDY	I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
ELIZABETH	Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding?... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
FREDDY	That's a tough choice.
ELIZABETH	Is it worth taking a chance?
FREDDY	I suppose you're right.
ELIZABETH	Of course I am. Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
FREDDY	Good night.
ELIZABETH	That's my good boy.
INGA	Why, Doctor... is anything the matter?
FREDDY	Just passing through the night.
INGA	What's wrong, Doctor? You seem... lonely.
FREDDY	Oh, a little. But it's not just physical loneliness. It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
INGA	I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
FREDDY	It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
INGA	Not fooling around.
FREDDY	I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
INGA	I see what you mean.
FREDDY	There can never... ever... be anything physical between us.
INGA	I know Frederick.
FREDDY	It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
INGA	Of course not.
FREDDY	For that matter, it wouldn't be fair to you, or to me.
INGA	What?
FREDDY	I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
INGA	Nor to Elizabeth.
FREDDY	No. Nor to Elizabeth.
INGA	We all have our feelings. I know that I have mine. And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
FREDDY	Yes, I do have my feelings. And, of course, you have yours.
INGA	And Elizabeth has hers.
FREDDY	Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
INGA	But, after all, you have yours.
FREDDY	Yes, I have mine.
INGA	And I have mine.
FREDDY	Yes... yes, you have yours.
INGA	Why don't we talk inside?
FREDDY	Well... ...perhaps for a few minutes.
FIRST VILLAGER	Burgomeister Krempen.
SECOND VILLAGER	Burgomeister Krempen!
THIRD VILLAGER	Burgomeister Krempen!
FOURTH VILLAGER	Mayor Krempen!
BURGOMEISTER	What is it? What's going on?
FIRST VILLAGER	The monster, sir. The Monster is loose.
BURGOMEISTER	Do you realize it's after eight o'clock???
SECOND VILLAGER	Yes, sir, but the monster. He's escaped!
THIRD VILLAGER	He's running through the countryside, terrorizing the villagers. No one is safe.
BURGOMEISTER	What do you mean 'the' monster -- as if this happened every Sunday. You mean 'a' monster.
FOURTH VILLAGER	No, sir, it's 'the' monster. The Frankenstein monster.
BURGOMEISTER	Oh, Tommy Rot!
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	Yes! Frankenstein! The Frankenstein monster!
BURGOMEISTER	Now wait a minute! Just wait a minute!
BURGOMEISTER	Now see here! There'll be no more wild accusations bandied about while I'm still Burgomeister of this village. If there is mischief afoot, the way to find out is to confront the man with the charges brought against him.It's the only decent thing to do. And as long as I'm Burgomeister of your village -- a man's name is still his honor.
FIRST VILLAGER	But it's true, sir. Young Master Freddy -- he's come from America and read all of his grandfather's secret notes. They've started the whole business all over again, sir.
BURGOMEISTER	That swine!
SECOND VILLAGER	It's in the blood, sir. The whole family is insane.
THIRD VILLAGER	He's got to be put away.
FOURTH VILLAGER	And the monster destroyed!
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	Yes! The monster! Kill the monster! The monster must be destroyed!
BURGOMEISTER	Now see here! Before we go running about, killing people, we'd better make damned sure of our facts. A riot is an ugly thing... and once you get one started -- there's little chance of stopping it short of bloodshed.
BURGOMEISTER	So the first thing we'll do, is march calmly up to the Frankenstein castle and have a nice little chat with our good doctor. Now then! Who doesn't have a torch and a dog? All right -- follow me!
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	Yay! Down with Frankenstein! Kill the monster!
FREDDY	It wouldn't be right... you know that.
INGA	Yes, I know.
FREDDY	It wouldn't be fair to her.
INGA	Yes, I know.
FREDDY	You've got to help me to remain faithful.
INGA	Yes, I will.
FREDDY	...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted. Three times a day -- anything!
BURGOMEISTER	Frederick Frankenstein?
FREDDY	You have the wrong house.
BURGOMEISTER	And who might you be?
FREDDY	Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
BURGOMEISTER	The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
FREDDY	No!
BURGOMEISTER	What was your grandfather's name?
FREDDY	Victor Frankenstein.
BURGOMEISTER	Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron. But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle. These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears. How say you?
FREDDY	Ugly, vicious rumous.
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	What was that? Listen! Did you hear that?
BURGOMEISTER	They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village. What say you to that?
FREDDY	Poppycock!
IGOR	He's back! He's back! The monster's back!
FREDDY	What monster?
IGOR	What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we made in the basement. I think we all need a good night's sleep. Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
BURGOMEISTER	Now wait a minute!
IGOR	You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
FREDDY	What???
IGOR	He's carrying her off now through the woods.
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	There he is! That's the monster! After him! Kill him!
IGOR	What now, boss? A little something to eat and then join the chase?
FREDDY	No! The only hope now is to get him back here. If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
IGOR	That sound good, boss.
FREDDY	...and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
IGOR	I like your style, master. How do we get him here?
FREDDY	There's only one way.
IGOR	I'll bet it's a doozy.
BURGOMEISTER	There he is!
1ST VILLAGER	What?
BURGOMEISTER	There he is!!
1ST VILLAGER	What?
BURGOMEUSTER	I said -- there he is!
TALL VILLAGER	Don't shoot! Don't shoot! It's ME!
MONSTER	MMmmm.
MONSTER	MMmmm!
MONSTER	MMMmmmm!
ELIZABETH	What...?
MONSTER	MMMmmmm!
ELIZABETH	What in God's name are you doing?
MONSTER	Baack!
ELIZABETH	What?
MONSTER	Baack!
MONSTER	Morrr!
ELIZABETH	Oh my goodness! Nineteen if it's an inch.
ELIZABETH	Penny for your thoughts.
ELIZABETH	You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MONSTER	MMMmmmm.
ELIZABETH	All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
ELIZABETH	What, dear? What is it?
MONSTER	MMMmm!
ELIZABETH	Is it that music?
MONSTER	MMMMM! MMMMM!
ELIZABETH	Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
ELIZABETH	Where are you going? They've left their F-M station on, that's all.
FREDDY	You can do it.
FREDDY	You can do it.
IGOR	Come on, big fellow!
FREDDY	Is everything ready?
IGOR	Yes, master. Are you sure you want to go through with it?
FREDDY	It's the only way.
IGOR	Okay, boss! But I hope you know what you're doing.
1ST VILLAGER	Wait a minute! Maybe he went back to the castle.
2ND VILLAGER	That's right!
3RD VILLAGER	He's probably right.
2ND VILLAGER	It was all a trick by that lunatic doctor.
3RD VILLAGER	Let's go back there and tear them both to pieces!
4TH VILLAGER	Now see here. Let's not lose our heads. We've always listened to our Burgomeister in the past. We should have the decency to hear him now.
1ST VILLAGER	Well -- what do you say, Burgomeister?
BURGOMEISTER	Let's go back there and tear them to pieces!
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	Yay! Back to the castle! Kill them both!
IGOR	It's the waiting I can't stand.
IGOR	How do you know they're done?
INGA	The doctor said to allow seven minutes: no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
IGOR	How long is it so far?
INGA	Four
IGOR	Three minutes to go!
INGA	Yes.
IGOR	What d'ya want to do to kill time?
INGA	Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid! I just hope this all ends well.
FRAU BLUCHER	Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes!
INGA	Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain? Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
IGOR	Absolutely! May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
INGA	What's that noise?
IGOR	Sounds like visitors. It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
FRAU BLUCHER	Victor. Victor! I'm coming. I'm coming, Victor!
FIRST VILLAGER	There they are!
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	Kill them! Kill that doctor! Kill the monster! Tear them both to pieces!
INGA	Igor -- what time is it?
IGOR	Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
INGA	Igor -- the clock! Hurry!
IGOR	Another fifteen seconds to go.
INGA	Do something! Stall them!
IGOR	Now see here! What is the meaning of this?
BURGOMEISTER	We want the doctor!
IGOR	What?
BURGOMEISTER	We want the doctor!
IGOR	What??
FIRST VILLAGER	...Come on, men!
SECOND VILLAGER	Here's that crackpot doctor. Let's get him first!
INGA	No! Please!
A GIANT VOICE	Put that man down!
AN OLD WOMAN	Why... it's the monster!
BURGOMEISTER	No, it couldn't be.
THIRD VILLAGER	Yes it is. It must be.
MONSTER	I said: Put that man down!
BURGOMEISTER	And who are you, sir, that you order these people about?
MONSTER	I am a relative of the doctor's. I came to visit him a few weeks ago, in hopes that this distinguished member of my family might be able to help me with a problem that I've had since birth... and which has caused more sorrow in my heart than I wish on any man.
ASSORTED VILLAGERS	What'd he say? Relative??
MONSTER	You see, because of my great size and the somewhat unusual features of my head -- when women look at me, their first impulse is to scream; children often cry, or vomit; and men are inclined to beat me over the head.
MONSTER	I lived in hopes of meeting people who would... overlook my outward appearance and respect me for whatever good qualities I had to offer. If anyone had ever shown a little kindness, I would have returned it, I think, at least one hundred times over. And for that one person's sake... I would have made piece with the whole world. Do you understand what it means -- never to see a kind or happy face? You could imagine then, perhaps, how such bitterness led me, at last, to the brink of another kind or life. I decided that if I couldn't inspire love...which was my deepest hope... I would, instead... cause fear.
MONSTER	But all of that happened to me a lifetime ago. And I paid for my crimes... severely. It was just then that fate, or chance, brought me to our famous doctor. I found this man to be vain; I found him to be driven with ambitions of personal glory, and consumed with an unquenchable thirst for power. But even at the height of his quest -- this ego- driven, brilliant and half-crazed scientist... always... always... held an image of me as something beautiful. And then, at the moment of truth, when it would have been easy enough to run and stay out of danger... he used himself as a guinea pig, in order to give me a calmer brain... and a slightly more eloquent way of speaking. Yes! I am 'The Monster"... sometimes known as 'Him,' or occasionally, 'The Creature.' But they're one and the same. I am that tall, peculiarly attractive stranger, with the winning smile. Would you all get the hell out of here! Oh, 'It's'...you were wonderful. But I'm so worried about the doctor.
ELIZABETH	Darling! I hope you didn't find Daddy's little party too boring. He did it just for you, and he meant well. Tell me you liked it.
A VOICE	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH'S VOICE	I know Mummy's just a scatterbrain without a serious thought in her head, but... you lover her just a little bit, don't you?
A VOICE	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH'S VOICE	I'm ready for bed, sweetheart. Almost done??
MONSTER	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH	Did you see?... I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts. The other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
MONSTER	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH	Still happy you married me?
MONSTER	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH	Love me oodles and oodles?
MONSTER	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH	So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
MONSTER	MMmmm.
INGA'S VOICE	Did you have a nice day today?
FREDDY	Oh, just the usual: sore throats, a few colds. Someone who thought he was a werewolf, and two bladder transplants.
INGA'S VOICE	Did you notice the new drapes I put up in the bedroom?
FREDDY	Yes!... They're very nice.
INGA'S VOICE	Oh, I'm glad.
INGA'S VOICE	I was hoping you'd like them.
INGA	All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
FREDDY	MMmmm.
INGA	Shall I set the alarm?
FREDDY	MMMmmm.
FREDDY	MMMMmmmmm!
INGA	Yes, sweetie... I heard you. So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
INGA	Are you ready for me?
FREDDY	MMMMmmmmm!
INGA	Ready for Fuchsmachen???
FREDDY	MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
INGA	I love it when you're excited. Come then, my Apfelstrudel! Come into my arms and let me hold you.
INGA	Sweetheart... Is this really you???
FREDDY	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
