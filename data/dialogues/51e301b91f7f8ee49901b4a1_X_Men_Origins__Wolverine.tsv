MASON	That's him.
GILMAN	What's the matter, you about to piss your pants? Answer me. The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully. You a tough guy like your daddy? Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The You want to play tough guy with me? Huh? Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his

GILMAN	What's the matter? You want some more? The boy doesn't look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy Let's get out of here. Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder.

SHERRLENE	You always hold out for gin. You could have knocked a while ago.
BEAK	Yeah, well, I'm an eternal. optimist. Sherrlene tallies the points.
SHERRLENE	All right, I'm gonna hit it. You want to come look for shells with me on the beach tomorrow?

LOGAN	How'd you find me?
STRYKER	We never lost you, my friend. I believe you know my colleague? Logan and Agent Zero stare at each other. There is a history We're with the Department of Agriculture now.
LOGAN	Agriculture? You working with farmers? Agent Zero grins. There is nothing pleasant about his grin,.

STRYKER	Boys, please. Could we take a minute of your time?
LOGAN	You're taking it.
STRYKER	We want you back. Logan turns away from them. He tosses aside the axe, picks up You're a born warrior. You can hide up here as long as you want, that's never gonna change.
LOGAN	Not interested.
STRYKER	It's... creative work, I can assure you of that. And it pays well.
LOGAN	Already got a job.
AGENT ZERO	Lumberjack. Eighteen grand a.year.
LOGAN	Eighteen five.
AGENT ZERO	You content chopping down trees?
LOGAN	Yeah, I am. It's good work. And I haven't killed anybody in three years.
AGENT ZERO	Starting to miss it?
LOGAN	Right about now I am. Agent Zero grins, enjoying the game. Stryker, seeing that
STRYKER	We're putting together a team. Best men in the business. Men with... special qualities. Men like you.
LOGAN	Forget it. Logan walks around to the front of the cabin. Stryker and
STRYKER	It's a team of hunters. We're going after some very bad people. Logan climbs into the driver's seat. You read the papers, Logan? They're killing mutants. Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to Listen to me. They have names. They have addresses.
LOGAN	I can take care of myself.
STRYKER	All right, forget about yourself. Your country needs you.

LOGAN	They started it.
LOGAN	Stryker came by the house today.
KAYLA	Stryker? Colonel Stryker? The one you told me about? What did he want?
LOGAN	Wants me back.
KAYLA	And?
LOGAN	Told him no.
KAYLA	So why can't they get someone else? Logan thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a
LOGAN	I'm the best there is at what I do. And what I do best isn't very nice. Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment. Maybe he's right. Maybe it's the only thing I'm good for. Kayla watches him. Logan shakes his head as if ridding Son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a minute. He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer. I'm not going anywhere. First time in my life, I don't feel like a freak.
KAYLA	Hey. You're not a freak.
LOGAN	Most guys don't have to worry about gutting their girlfriend when they have a bad dream.
KAYLA	You're not a freak. You've got a gift.
LOGAN	A gift? Logan shakes his head, staring at the black ribbon of road. You can return a gift..
KAYLA	The kids made cornhusk dolls today in Arts and Crafts. She reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll. I made one for you. Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight.

KAYLA	You know why the moon's so lonely? Logan shakes his head. Kayla lies back, resting her head on She used to have a lover. Kuekuatsheu. They lived in the Spirit World and every night they'd wander the skies together. But one of the other spirits was jealous. Trickster wanted the Moon for himself. So he told Kuekuatsheu the Moon asked for flowers. He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses.
LOGAN	Never trust a guy named Trickster.
KAYLA	Yeah, well, you do some stupid things when you're in love. Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the Spirit World, you can never go back. Now he's trapped here. Every night the Moon searches for him and every night he sees her in the sky and howls her name... but he can never touch her again. For a moment they're both quiet, contemplating the sad myth.
LOGAN	Koo-koo-choo got screwed.
KAYLA	Kuekuatsheu. The Wolverine. Logan comes around to the driver's side window, holding his

LOGAN	Where is he?
STRYKER (O.S.)	His name is Victor Creed. Logan turns and sees Stryker standing at the entrance to the I can help you find him.
STRYKER	He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in Nevada last year. Started murdering mutants. Shape- changer in New Mexico, pair of telekinetic twins in California-- Logan turns on Stryker, grabbing the colonel by the throat

STRYKER	I came to warn you--
LOGAN	You knew he was coming. f CONTTNfJRD 1 Stryker shakes his head as well as he can with Logan's hand How did you know?
STRYKER	He got the List.
LOGAN	What list? Stryker chokes, gasping for air. Logan eases up on his grip
STRYKER	The List. Every known mutant in North America. Government's been keeping it for years. Names, addresses, everything.
LOGAN	How did he get it?
STRYKER	There are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed. Logan releases Stryker. The ex-colonel straightens his jacket
LOGAN	Creed's a mutant, too.
STRYKER	Apparently he doesn't have much tribal loyalty. Logan turns and walks away. He looks like a homeless man, his Do you have a plan, Captain?

STRYKER	Do you have a plan? CnNTTNT TF.Tf 1 Logan turns and stares at Stryker.
LOGAN	I'm gonna track him down and I'm gonna end him. That's the plan.
STRYKER	You already tried that. He's a hundred miles away and you're walking out of the hospital. Logan's fists are clenched. He's ready to hammer Stryker into You can't beat him. Not the way you are right now. You've probably gone your whole life without losing a fight, but I'm telling you now, you can't beat him. Unless I give you the tools.

LOGAN	Never wanted to put these on again.
STRYKER	Held on to them for years. Figured you'd be back one day. Logan slips the steel chain over his head. Now you'll always know your name.

STRYKER	He can handle the pain.

HINES (O.S.)	He might not, either. There's a significant chance the procedure will kill him.
STRYKER (O.S.)	Correct. Some experiments succeed, some fail. That's why we call them "experiments."

GENERAL MUNSON I	We tried to use that stuff for tank armor. Too damn expensive.
STRYKER	It took us three years to prepare enough alloy for the skeleton.
GENERAL MUNSON	So if this works, I guess Weapon X won't be walking through any metal detectors.

STRYKER	We need the Eleven. Our victory in the war to come depends on it.
GENERAL MUNSON	Not everyone in the Pentagon thinks there's gonna be a war. Stryker turns and fixes his gaze on the general.

HEATHER HUDSON	Jimmy. Let the boy eat. Logan piles eggs onto a slice of buttered toast.

FRANCIS	Nothing very fancy. They tell me when they're scared. When they're angry. When they're hungry.
VICTOR CREED	You ever talk to a panther, Francis? Francis shakes his head. CONTTNi7Ff)1 Every now and then a white panther comes along. Albino. The mama panther won't even look at it.

LOGAN	You tryin' to insult me?
WRAITH	Can't be too careful, brother. I've been retired five years I still check under the car every time I drive.

WRAITH	Why don't you two get a manicure or something and meet me back here in the morning. Want a beer?
LOGAN	Always. Wraith leads Logan toward an office in the back, draping an
WRAITH	I love you like a brother. So I'm giving you thirty minutes. After that, you're too dangerous to know.
WRAITH	What I hear, our friend the Colonel's got eyes all over the country looking for you. He ain't about to let Weapon X go rogue on him. Wraith pops the caps off the beer bottles and hands one to

WRAITH	I keep my ear to the ground. People like us, we never really quit the game.
LOGAN	I did. Woke up one day and knew I was done. Logan peels the label from his bottle of beer. Stryker used to give me a new name every Monday. And by the end of the week, I'd draw a line through it. I .put a whole lot of people under the ground. And one day I realized... Stryker was never gonna run out of names. Wraith nods, meditative.
WRAITH	Our friend the Colonel has big plans.
LOGAN	What kind of plans?
WRAITH	Hear a lot of chatter about something called the Eleven. My boys in Arlington say it's the biggest covert weapons project since FDR built himself an atom bomb. Other than that, no one knows a goddamn thing. Wraith places his bottle on his desk and sits up straight in Look, I... I heard about what happened to your woman. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. Logan nods. He doesn't want to talk about it. I did a little contract work with Creed back in the day. I've known some seriously foul people, but that cat... They say he took out a whole village in Nicaragua one time, every man, woman, and child, killed 'em all, just 'cause he was bored. I been screwed, sued, and tattooed, but I never killed no kids.
LOGAN	Creed did government work?
WRAITH	Till they got wise to him. Wherever he went there was a trail of bodies. And not always the right bodies, you know what I'm saying? There is murder in Logan's eyes.
LOGAN	Help me find him.
WRAITH	He's a hard cat to track.
LOGAN	Just tell me where to start looking. I'll do the rest. Wraith taps the bottleneck, considering.
WRAITH	Might want to talk to his friends from the ultramax.
LOGAN	The prison he busted out of? Feds built it to hold the baddest of the bad mutants. Worked pretty well. Only problem-- now they all know each other. You ever hear of a guy named Fred J. Dukes?
LOGAN	Nope.
WRAITH	People call him the Blob. You find him, you'll know why. Got out of the hoosegow a few months ago. Went home to Iowa. Town called Elgin.

STRYKER	Weapon X is a prototype. Nothing more. He's the walking proof that enhanced skeletons are viable.

LOGAN	You're not innocent, Doc. He leans forward, forearms on the tabletop. What does Victor Creed have to do with the Weapon X program?
HINES	It's not the Weapon X program, it's the Weapon Ultra program. Started sixty-five years ago. They've been trying to make the perfect soldier for a long time. First to fight the Nazis. Then the Communists. Now it's mutants.
LOGAN	So where does Weapon X fit in? Hines closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.
HINES	You don't understand. X is a letter but it's also a Roman numeral. Weapon "Ex" is a nickname. Officially, you're Weapon Ten. Victor Creed is Weapon Nine.

CORNELIUS	According to the computer models we ran, there's a 30 percent chance his healing factor will reconstitute the gray matter. But those synaptic bridges that form our memories? Gone. If he survives, his brain will come back fresh.

LOGAN	Prison... Kayla finally raises her head-and looks directly at Logan.
KAYLA	Shot my Daddy when I was eighteen. Big mistake. Should have shot him when I was seventeen.
LOGAN	You told me he died of a heart attack.
KAYLA	Maybe he had a heart attack after I shot him. Sat there and watched him bleed. After what that man did to me, I wish he died slower. Logan stares at her for a long time. That sweet little girl you lived with in the cabin? That was all make-believe.

KAYLA	I'm a good actress.
LOGAN	No one's that good.

VICTOR CREED	You mean I don't get to potty train him?
CORNELIUS	But every memory you've ever had will evaporate. Just like it never happened. Logan never takes his eyes off Kayla, his personal Judas.

LOGAN	That story you told me... about the guy who goes to get flowers for the Moon. I can't get it out of my head. Except I had it all backwards. I thought you were the moon and I was your Wolverine. But you're the Trickster, aren't you? And I'm just a schmuck who got played. Kayla is silent for a moment.

LOGAN	You didn't trick me into loving you.
KAYLA	What?
LOGAN	The last two months, you weren't playing around in my skull. You weren't using. your powers on me. I thought you were dead and I loved you more than ever. Maybe it makes you feel better to think it was all fake. But it was never fake for me. Kayla lowers her eyes.

LOGAN	I know exactly what is was like. I come from there too.

CORNELIUS	This could take a while. Raise the amperage by forty percent.

ATTACK! ATTACK!	The Eleven charge. From above we can see the full-scale of Logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it. Creaks Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle He reaches a third pillar and chops through it. Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling. Dust and rocks An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety, Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater A few dazed survivors, SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS, have escaped
KAYLA	One of them could have survived. Logan glances at her. The clones. They've got your healing factor. Logan looks back at the devastation.
LOGAN	Unless someone comes along who can move a few million tons of steel, they ain't going anywhere.
LOGAN	Almost looks peaceful from here.
KAYLA	There's something I want you to know. He looks at her. Maybe nothing I say matters anymore. But I'm going to say it anyway. I... A blossom of blood opens up on her chest. She stares down at No... Stryker fires again. The adamantium bullet rips through Stryker turns the gun on Kayla. You don't need to waste another bullet. I'm already dead. Stryker blinks and hesitates. Kayla coughs, her strength Maybe you should turn that gun on yourself, Colonel. Stryker nods, pointing the gun at his own head. It would be good for the mutants if I made you pull the trigger.. Why do you hate us so much? Stryker's finger trembles on the trigger. Is it because your son is one of us? For the first time, perhaps, we see something human in the Enough killing, Colonel. Throw your gun in the lake. Stryker does as he's told. The revolver sinks into the water. Leave us. Keep walking till your feet start to bleed. Stryker turns and walks away. Kayla crawls over to Logan. She lifts his head onto her lap. She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it, If you ever remember what I did to you, try to forgive me. I was a fool. And you were right... I always loved you. She turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back, He sits up, looking around. The woods are empty. He stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and He takes a deep breath of cold air and walks west, toward the He doesn't know who he is. He doesn't know where he's going. He walks toward his destiny..
