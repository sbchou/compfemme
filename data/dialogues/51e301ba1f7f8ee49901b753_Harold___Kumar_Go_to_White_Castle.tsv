CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg	BILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting
MAN (O.S.)	Billy Boy! J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
J.D.	Get your ass ready! It's almost five o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his drink on! J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.
J.D.	Oh God. Give me that. I'm burning it once and for all. J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as
BILLY	Don't!
J.D.	Dude, it's been six months. You have to move on. BILLY nods knowingly.
J.D.	You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot chick riding your jock all night long.
BILLY	You're such a romantic, J.D.
J.D.	It would help get your mind off of Sarah. BILLY ponders this for a moment.
BILLY	Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other women, I wouldn't even know what to do. I've been out of the game so long.
J.D.	Billy, you come out with me tonight, and I promise you'll get laid.
BILLY	Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors.
J.D.	So what? It's Friday! You have all weekend to do that.
BILLY	No I don't. The Germans are taking an earlier flight back, so the meeting's been moved to tomorrow. J.D. thinks for a moment.
J.D.	Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then?
BILLY	Who? J.D. gets a big smile on his face. He has an idea.
BILLY	Harold, listen, I need you to update these models for me.
HAROLD	But aren't you supposed to...
BILLY	I know, but something came up. I have to meet with some clients tonight, so I won't be able to get to it. It's your responsibility now. Okay? Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to
J.D.	And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine o'clock sharp. With all the downsizing going on around here, we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson that you've been slacking. He's just dying to figure out who he should fire next.
HAROLD	Uh...okay...no problem... BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.
BILLY	Wow! I can't believe how easy that was!
J.D.	Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done? I'm telling you -- those Asian guys love crunching numbers. You probably just made his weekend. The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE. Now get ready. It's time we embark on...Operation Get Some! And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes Intercut:
HAROLD	Fuck.
KUMAR	Mononucleosis or mono is an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite.
DR. WOODRUFF	Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're one of the best applicants I've ever interviewed. Not that it's a surprise. Your father is very respected in his field. You know he and I had some pretty wild times when we were in med school.
KUMAR	Really?
DR. WOODRUFF	Yeah. We started our own basketball team-- the Hemoglobin Trotters... Yeah, we were crazy. Kumar nods and smiles. Woodruff finally stops laughing...
DR. WOODRUFF	Anyway-- just one more question. What are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis?
KUMAR	Let's see. There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness... Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
KUMAR	I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second? Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.
KUMAR	Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking. Oh, hey. Nothing important. I can talk. What's up? Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of
HAROLD	I'm not gonna be able to partake in our usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta stay late at the office.
KUMAR	Fuck that shit! We had plans! Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.
HAROLD	I know, but I gotta get this work done.
KUMAR	Oh come on! When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work? Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply
HAROLD (O.S.)	Listen, I'd love to go home, but...
KUMAR	No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and I'm not smoking it alone. So you're just gonna have to chill the fuck out, bring your work home, and prepare to get blazed, because in a couple of hours I expect both of us to be blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay good. See you later. Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down. Dr. Woodruff is
KUMAR	Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock.
DR. WOODRUFF	Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a proper interview. Do you actually believe after the way you've behaved that I would ever even consider recommending you for admission?
KUMAR	No. I'd actually be pretty surprised. Dr. Woodruff is flustered. He doesn't know how to react.
KUMAR	Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I'm not really planning on going to med school.
DR. WOODRUFF	But...you have perfect MCAT scores!
KUMAR	Well, I'm not an idiot. Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words. Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr.
KUMAR	Wow! Is this your daughter? A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's
HAROLD	Yes! Right in front... Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he
HAROLD	Those assholes. The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK
COLE	This is America, dude! Learn how to drive!
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1	Better ruck tomorrow! Frustrated, Harold turns around and continues driving...
HAROLD	Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous.
HAROLD	So Maria, what's been going on?
MARIA	Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week. How about you?
HAROLD	My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change.
MARIA	Really?
HAROLD	Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like crap. But a man can dream, right?
HAROLD	So what are you up to tonight?
MARIA	Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a little bit, clean up the apartment, and then go over to my boyfriend's place. He's cooking me a really nice dinner.
HAROLD	Really?
MARIA	Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. I'll actually probably just sit on my ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch Blind Date.
HAROLD	That sounds awful. Harold laughs, as does Maria. They smile at each other...
HAROLD	Well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place.
MARIA	Maybe.
MARIA	Bye. DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 10.
HAROLD	Bye.
HAROLD	Kumar?
KUMAR (O.C.)	Yeah, I'm in here! Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's
HAROLD	Kumar? In here... Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA
HAROLD	Kumar, what the hell are you doing!
KUMAR	I'm trimming my pubes. Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple
HAROLD	Why aren't you doing this in your room!
KUMAR	The mirror's in here. Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai tree!
HAROLD	I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on.
KUMAR	Chill out. It makes my Johnson look bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll end up with pubes like my dad. You've seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right? HAROLD notices something...
HAROLD	Are those my scissors? Oh my God! I trim my nose hair with those!
KUMAR	Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months. Kumar puts the scissors down and EXITS THE ROOM. Harold
KUMAR	So what the hell is your problem, anyway?
HAROLD (O.C.)	Other than my roommate's boney ass?
HAROLD	One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight. Kumar walks back into Harold's room...
KUMAR	I assume you gave him the appropriate "go fuck yourself."
HAROLD	If by "go fuck yourself" you mean "no problem sir" then yes, he got the message loud and clear. KUMAR shakes his head in disgust...
KUMAR	Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say "no" once in a while. Now lets get high.
HAROLD	No. I got a lot of work to finish. Kumar shuts Harold's laptop.
KUMAR	Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later. Come on, let's smoke a couple joints. Harold thinks for a moment and then caves...
HAROLD	One joint.
KUMAR	One and a half. Now let's do this... Kumar exits the room... HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see
MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT	Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your interview today was good. I'm calling to remind you that you have another one tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from Cornell at 10:00 a.m. Do not be late! Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the M.C.A.T.
MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT	It is very important you show up on time! Mommy and I will be very upset if you do not go. Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the meeting is at ten o'clock. Bye bye.
HAROLD	Don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously? At some point your dad's gonna get really pissed.
KUMAR	So what? It's not like there's a shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor. Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean I have to.
HAROLD	Well, then what are you going to do?
KUMAR	I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat.
HAROLD	Sounds like a plan. It's an episode of "The Router Workshop."
KUMAR	I think we've already seen this one. Harold changes the channel... It's an anti-marijuana commercial. Two teenagers are
BLONDE HAIRED KID	Come on, dude. Just take one hit. Don't you want to be cool? Nervously, Brown Haired Kid takes a hit of the joint. Right
BLONDE HAIRED KID	Hey man, what are you doing?
BROWN HAIRED KID	I'm so high! Nothing can hurt me! The Brown Haired Kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)	Marijuana kills. They're laughing their asses off at the commercial.
KUMAR	I love that shit! Harold continues flipping channels...
ANGLE- TV	We see a News report
NEWSCASTER	Tonight...a Cheetah escaped from the Morristown Zoo... ANGLE - Harold and Kumar Harold's not interested. He continues flipping...
HAROLD	Nice. Sixteen Candles is on.
KUMAR	And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... ...Harold Lee! Come on down! Take a bow!
HAROLD	Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie! It's a classic! It's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved...
KUMAR	Hey look! It's you! Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he
KUMAR	chores around here? Harold gives Kumar a "don't even joke" look. He then
HAROLD	We're so high right now.
KUMAR	We're not low.
HAROLD	I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as balls.
KUMAR	No shit! Let's eat! HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that
KUMAR	Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight.
HAROLD	What about KFC?
KUMAR	Nah, we've been there too many times. I want something we haven't had in awhile. Something different. Something that'll really hit the spot. I want the perfect food...
VOICE ON TV	Are you hungry? HAROLD and KUMAR turn their attention to the TV, where they
VOICE ON TV	Then come to White Castle and try our Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and a soft drink for only 2.99. HAROLD and KUMAR start salivating, as they see THE STEAM RISE
VOICE ON TV	Imagine all those burgers in your stomach right now. Mmmmmh.... HAROLD and KUMAR move closer to the TV to smell the burgers.
VOICE ON TV	Don't you like food that's tasty and delicious? Almost in a trance, HAROLD and KUMAR nod agreeingly.
VOICE ON TV	Then what are you waiting for? Head over to White Castle. It's what you crave. The commercial ends. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other--
HAROLD	You're sure you know how to get there? I haven't been to White Castle in ages.
KUMAR	I'm telling you, there's one right around the corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick. They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment.
KUMAR	Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up. We're going to White Castle. Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV...
ROSENBERG	Wait-- we're watching The Gift on HBO.
KUMAR	No waiting. We're starving... Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing
KUMAR	...Put that down! We're not eating `til we get to White Castle. Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as
KUMAR	Now come on guys, let's go.
GOLDSTEIN	Sorry man! We're not going anywhere. Supposedly, Katie Holmes shows her milk paps in this movie!
HAROLD	Is that all you Jews ever think about? Tits?
ROSENBERG	We're talking about Katie Holmes here. You would never think a sweet, innocent girl like her would ever take her top off. Which is precisely why we have to watch her do it.
GOLDSTEIN	Dude, the things I'd eat out of her ass, you have no idea. Bacon, shellfish, milk with meat, you name it... DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 18.
ROSENBERG	That's a very vulgar statement.
GOLDSTEIN	So is "I want to pound Britney Spears in the pussy." But it's true.
ROSENBERG	Touché. Anyway, if you guys want to wait till the movie's over... HAROLD and KUMAR have already shut the door.
KUMAR	What the hell are you bringing that for? Harold hands Kumar his keys.
HAROLD	You're driving. I'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car. Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty.
KUMAR	Shit, I forgot my cell phone.
HAROLD	Why don't you just run back and get it?
KUMAR	Nah, we've gone too far. Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door.
KUMAR	Hey, there's your girlfriend. You actually gonna talk to her this time?
KUMAR	What the hell are you doing? That was a perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle.
KUMAR	You're worthless.
HAROLD	I'm not worthwhile.
KUMAR	Dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy. Just talk to her once and I promise you it won't be weird anymore...
HAROLD	It doesn't matter. The only girls interested in me are girls I have no interest in. Like Cindy Kim.
KUMAR	Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier. One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.
HAROLD	God, she invites me to everything.
KUMAR	So what? She's fucking cute. Let her touch your penis. They exit the front door of the building...
COLE	Hey look, it's the Brother's McFag! Let me guess, the yellow one's the catcher!
COLE	Come on, guys! Let's get ourselves some fucking Mountain Dew!
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1	Extreme! They take off, driving by Harold and Kumar. Harold gives
HAROLD	Why do I have to be the catcher?
KUMAR	Dude, forget about those pricks. Let's just go. They continue walking...
KUMAR	Jesus, that took forever. You know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking. And what kind of parking job is this? You're like a mile away from the curb.
HAROLD	Don't even start.
KUMAR	Just fucking with you. Now let's go out and get those burgers. I'm fucking starving! They get in the car and slam the door. The engine starts and
KUMAR	Hey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay?
HAROLD	Of course he's gay! You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like... "Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel soooo good!" Kumar laughs.
KUMAR	Dude, give me thirty-five cents. HAROLD sorts through some change in his hand and gives Kumar
KUMAR	What's going on? It didn't register. Dude, give me thirty-five more cents.
HAROLD	I don't have anymore change.
KUMAR	Should I just go through?
HAROLD	No. I don't like breaking the law. Harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on.
KUMAR	I can see that. A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a
BIG BURLY GUY	Hey! Move your ass!
KUMAR	I'm going through.
HAROLD	Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened. The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door...
BIG BURLY GUY	Move, you fucking twat! Kumar can't take it anymore. Just as Harold is about to get
HAROLD	Are you crazy?
HAROLD	Oh shit, we're dead! Harold throws the joint out the window.
KUMAR	What the fuck is wrong with you?!
HAROLD	You just tore out of there! The cops are gonna catch us!
KUMAR	No they're not!
HAROLD	Take this exit!
KUMAR	What? We see Harold's Infiniti swerve onto the Newark EXIT...
KUMAR	That was the last of our weed.
HAROLD	Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes.
KUMAR	Now we're in Newark of all places. You know we're gonna get shot.
HAROLD	Maybe it's not as bad as they say. It's probably just a bunch of hype. They look out the window and see another ASIAN and INDIAN guy Kumar gives Harold a dirty look.
HAROLD	Let's get the hell out of here. KUMAR continues driving. He makes a turn. All of a sudden, he
HAROLD	What the...
HAROLD	Dude, we are NOT driving through that basketball game!
KUMAR	We have to if we want to get out of here. Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead.
HAROLD	Forget about it. No way.
KUMAR	Come on. How do you know they're not peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys? With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS
HAROLD	Turn the car around.
KUMAR	Why? Are cars not allowed to go through when a game's going on? When we were kids, we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street. The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.
HAROLD	For some reason, I don't think this is the same thing.
KUMAR	I'm going through. KUMAR begins inching forward.
HAROLD	Don't! The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside.
KUMAR	Look. They're moving. I told you. Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar,
HAROLD	Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us.
KUMAR	How do you know?
HAROLD	Look at him! The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN has an ESPECIALLY ANGRY FACE.
KUMAR	Oh fuck. KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM.
RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER	Man, you scared the shit out of them! Make that face again!
HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN	Okay, okay, okay... THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN suppresses his laughter and
HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN	Shit. I can't do it. His friends laugh harder. He tries to regain his composure.
HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN	Hold up. Hold up... He manages to make his angriest face for two seconds, before
HAROLD	That was close, dude.
KUMAR	Rold, check it out! We're almost there!
HAROLD	Yes! Thank God! I'm starving!
KUMAR	Well, prepare to gorge yourself.
HAROLD	Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like twenty of those burgers.
KUMAR	I'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries.
HAROLD	God, where the hell is this place?
KUMAR	Don't worry, we'll find it. HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead...
HAROLD	There's the multiplex!
KUMAR	That means the White Castle should be just around the corner...
HAROLD	What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That doesn't look like a White Castle to me!
KUMAR	We gotta get to the bottom of this!
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	I'm sorry. You have to order at the drive thru menu...
KUMAR	What happened to the White Castle?
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	Excuse me?
KUMAR	There used to be a White Castle right in this spot. Where is it?
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here. Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Burger Shack bought this location four years ago. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated.
KUMAR	Please tell me there's another White Castle in town.
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	Nope.
HAROLD	Are you sure?
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	Do I look like the type of guy who would be unsure about something like this? HAROLD and KUMAR are freaking out.
KUMAR	Shit. What are we gonna do?
HAROLD	I don't know. Should we just eat here?
KUMAR	Do you really think that'll satisfy us? The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation.
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	There's a 24 hour White Castle in Cherry Hill, about forty-five minutes away.
KUMAR	I can make the trip if you're willing to.
HAROLD	Kumar, I have a shitload of work to finish. And you have that med school interview in the morning.
KUMAR	Forget about the med school interview. It's a non-issue.
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	If I may interject for a moment... I've been an employee here for three years now, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that when you're craving White Castle, the burgers here simply won't cut it. In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me want to burn this place to the ground and re-build a White Castle in its place. If I were you, I'd suck it up and make the trip. KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.
KUMAR	You can always do your work in the car. HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.
HAROLD	Let's do it.
KUMAR	Then it's settled. No matter what, we're not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed? KUMAR puts his hand out. HAROLD shakes it.
HAROLD	Agreed.
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	Wise choice. Besides, you wouldn't want to go near our special sauce tonight. Some of the guys and I added an extra ingredient, if you know what I mean. HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE	I'll give you a hint... It's semen. We hear Harold and Kumar scream in disgust as Harold's
KUMAR	White Castle, here we come. I just wish we had some more pot. I'm almost completely sober right now. HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP--
KUMAR	Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here. Kumar takes the exit.
HAROLD	Why?
KUMAR	We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into finding us some weed.
HAROLD	Oh no. I'm not seeing Cindy.
KUMAR	Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the phone all the time.
HAROLD	She calls me. Then she rambles on about her East Asian Students club or whatever. And I have to pretend like I actually give a shit, or she'll call me a twinkie.
KUMAR	A twinkie?
HAROLD	You know, yellow on the outside, white on the inside.
KUMAR	weed out the window, so now it's your duty to make sure we're high as shit by the time we're eating those burgers.
HAROLD	Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us.
KUMAR	As long as she buzzes us into a dorm, we're set. Give me ten minutes in there and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy.
HAROLD	No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim.
CINDY	I'm so glad you showed up, Harold!
HAROLD	Yeah. Me too.
CINDY	Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued to the envelope I sent you?
HAROLD	Uh, yeah. They were...nice. Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises
HAROLD	Uh, yes? DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 31.
KENNETH	Kenneth Park. Class of 2004. Is it true you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan?
HAROLD	Yeah, I'm a junior analyst.
KENNETH	Awesome! KENNETH high-fives with the nerdy Asian student next to him.
HAROLD	Yes?
KENNETH	Uh, this is actually a two-part question. I'm applying for a summer internship at what it's like being an investment banker and b) if you would write me a recommendation.
HAROLD	What it's like being an investment banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty... HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian
HAROLD	...awesome? All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.
HAROLD	As for the recommendation, I may be able to make a call or two... CINDY looks at her watch...
CINDY	Actually Harold, we should be getting to the party. We can discuss all this stuff there. It's just down the hall. All the Asian students get up...
HAROLD	Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait for Kumar...
CINDY	You'll see him when we're done. Trust me, you're gonna love this. Kenny's mom dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae. Kenneth looks proud of himself.
HAROLD	Nice. CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away.
KUMAR	Hey! You know where I can get some chronic? The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated...
KUMAR	What kind of Ivy League school is this?
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up? KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief...
KUMAR	Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime of your finest herb. The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A
KUMAR	Oh my dear sweet lord... Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Yo, man! Not cool! This is my baby, man! DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 33.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	That'll be eighty bucks.
KUMAR	Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops, bro! The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy it. That's cool with me. I can find lots of people who want to get high. I can smoke it myself, man.
KUMAR	Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you?
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	One who understands the concept of supply and demand, dude. Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Dumbass. Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE,
CHRISTY	Hey, you guys about to smoke? KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS. They're
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Yeah. Wanna come back to my place?
KUMAR	Please. Like they want to go listen to a bunch of Phish records while you read your lame ass poetry. Ladies? Wanna get high and have some fun? CHRISTY and CLARISSA look at each other. They like this dude.
CHRISTY CLARISSA	Sure! Sure!
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Hey, my poetry isn't lame! It's actually quite good. The girls clearly aren't convinced. The ignore him and turn
CHRISTY	We're just gonna eat before this gets cold. What do you say we meet you back in our room in twenty minutes?
CLARISSA	We're in room 109.
KUMAR	109. Got it. I'll see you later.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Yeah, see you there. THE TWINS walk away. Kumar's excited. Hippie Asshole tries
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Not cool, man.
KUMAR	Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick! There are these two filthy pussies who are just aching to get boned by us. KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words.
KUMAR	Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely, young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I.
CINDY	Sorry. Harold's coming with us.
KUMAR	That's bullshit. He's coming with me. Isn't that right, Rold? CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her.
HAROLD	Let's go to the party for a little while.
KUMAR	Fuck that! KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room,
KUMAR	Here-- this is Harold's understudy. You can do whatever you want with him. Let's go. KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY
KUMAR	I can't believe you were gonna ditch me for the Joy Luck Club. You know what their parties are like.
HAROLD	Look, what do you want me to say? I was under pressure.
KUMAR	Just say "no"! That's all it takes. Now take a hit of this. Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens
SECURITY GUARD	Hey, what are you two doing?! HAROLD and KUMAR start running down the hallway.
SECURITY GUARD	Hey, get back here! HAROLD and KUMAR duck around the corner. They see a door to
KUMAR	Quick. In here. The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.
HAROLD	Shit! What if he finds us?
KUMAR	Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for us in the women's bathroom. Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom.
KUMAR	Shit! Get in that stall! There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom. They're
CHRISTY	Hurry up, I want to go smoke pot with that cute Indian bloke. IN STALL NUMBER TWO, KUMAR'S ears perk up, as we see HAROLD
CLARISSA	It'll be a few minutes, I'm about to have the worst case of the taco shits. KUMAR is clearly upset to hear this.
HAROLD	Ew...gross. CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door.
CHRISTY	Oh great. Now I think I have to go. CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door. From above, we see HAROLD and KUMAR struggling, while the
CLARISSA	Ahhhhh! HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified. There is silence for a few
CHRISTY	Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle shits? We see HAROLD quizzically mouth "battle shits?"
CLARISSA	Oh my God. We haven't played that since back in camp! HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.
CHRISTY	Wait for it. Wait for it. Ahhhhh!
CLARISSA	Hit! HAROLD and Kumar look terrified.
CINDY	Have you seen a Korean guy around here?
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of them in this dorm. `Tard. Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid.
CLARISSA	Hit! We see HAROLD dry heave. We hear the sound of diarrhea hitting the bowl again.
CHRISTY	You sank my destroyer! Scag! KUMAR almost pukes as HE DROPS THE POT INTO THE TOILET BOWL.
HAROLD	Shit! With that, HAROLD runs out of the stall and exits the
CHRISTY	Who was that? KUMAR looks nervous. He quickly bolts from the bathroom.
CLARISSA	Christy, are you still here?
CLARISSA	Damn! You sank my battle shit! Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the
KENNETH	Pot brownies for everyone! Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth...
CUTE ASIAN CHICK #1	Hey, K-dog! Can we have some brownies?
KENNETH	To tell you the truth, I'm running low. But a quick titty flash may persuade me. The Korean chicks look at each other. "Should we?" "Okay!"
KUMAR	Dude, I'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party... Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY
SECURITY GUARD	Hey, you! The guys turn and see the guards running at them. HAROLD AND
CINDY KIM	Harold! They keep running, past the bathrooms, where Christy and
CHRISTY AND CLARISSA	Kumar! They continue running. The guards are still running after Harold and Kumar, who see
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Where the hell is 109, man? Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close Harold and Kumar burst out the doors and EXIT THE DORM...
SECURITY GUARD	Well, well, well. What have we here?
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Aw, dude! Don't take it! It's mine! He continues to protest as SECURITY GUARD #2 holds him down.
KUMAR	I can't believe it. We were this close to getting high and getting laid.
HAROLD	Oh, come on, you always exaggerate. We weren't gonna get laid.
KUMAR	Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex with us! And what about Cindy?! She was looking hot tonight! The fact that you're not into her just might make you gay!
HAROLD	I know Cindy's cute, it's just...
KUMAR	What? You'd rather have Maria? From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.
HAROLD	Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end up with Cindy anyway. It's just more practical. Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle?
KUMAR	Fine. Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road...
HAROLD	Now what are you doing?
KUMAR	Daddy needs to urinate. Harold rolls his eyes.
KUMAR	Oh yes! Yes, that's nice. Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple
KUMAR	Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask you...why are you peeing here?
CREEPY GUY	What do you mean?
KUMAR	Why did you decide to piss here right next to me? Why not that bush over there?
CREEPY GUY	Well, this looked like a good bush to pee on. Why'd you choose this bush?
KUMAR	Nobody was here when I chose this bush.
CREEPY GUY	So you can pee here and nobody else can, is that it?
KUMAR	I was just saying....
CREEPY GUY	Is this like your special bush or something?
KUMAR	No, I just... You know what? Forget about it. I'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now. The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate
CREEPY GUY	Nice pubes.
KUMAR	Thanks.
HAROLD	Do you even know where you're going?
KUMAR	I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But don't worry. Once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon.
HAROLD	We better. It starts to rain...
HAROLD	Shit, now it's raining.
KUMAR	What's the big deal?
HAROLD	Look, I'm completely on edge right now, okay? After all the shit we've been through tonight, I don't know how much more of this I can take. KUMAR turns and sees the raccoon on Harold.
KUMAR	Holy shit! HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck. KUMAR
KUMAR	How the hell did that get in here?
HAROLD	Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have rabies now or something!
KUMAR	Don't worry. He didn't even break your skin. You'll be fine.
HAROLD	Oh, that's not good!
KUMAR	Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me!!!
KUMAR	Thank Christ! Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF
HAROLD KUMAR	Shit!!! Shit!!! KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD
HAROLD	Uh-oh. KUMAR rolls down his window. The DRIVER peers inside...
GOLDSTEIN	What the hell do you think you were doing? You almost killed us! GOLDSTEIN sees that it's HAROLD and KUMAR.
GOLDSTEIN	Holy Shit!
KUMAR	Goldstein? HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief.
GOLDSTEIN	Dude, it's Rold and Kumar!
KUMAR	What the hell are you guys doing here?
ROSENBERG	We got the munchies, so we're out trying to find a Hot Dog Heaven.
ROSENBERG	What about you guys? How was White Castle?
HAROLD	We haven't gotten there yet. I think I got rabies, though.
KUMAR	Dude-- how were Katie Holmes' tits?
GOLDSTEIN	You know the holocaust?
KUMAR	Yeah.
GOLDSTEIN	Picture the exact opposite of that.
KUMAR	Nice.
ROSENBERG	Apologize to Hashem.
GOLDSTEIN	Who the hell is...
ROSENBERG	Just apologize!
GOLDSTEIN	Okay, I'm sorry.
ROSENBERG	You really need to meet a girl.
KUMAR	Well, if you have the yellow fever tonight, there's a rocking Asian party over at Princeton tonight.
GOLDSTEIN	Man, I have the yellow plague. There's nothing sexier than a hot Asian chick...or dude for that matter...
GOLDSTEIN	Come on, let me suck it...let me see it and suck on it...come on, Rold, let's rub our dicks together...Jewish swordfight... Harold backs away as the other three laugh...
HAROLD	Will you stop it? I'm feeling very woozy. I may have to go to the hospital.
KUMAR	Dude, you don't have rabies! We're not going to the hospital.
GOLDSTEIN	Yo, we gotta hit this Asian party.
ROSENBERG	Oh no! No more detours! Let's just stick with the plan and get to Krispee Kreme. You guys wouldn't believe some of the weird shit we've been through the last couple hours. Harold and Kumar look at each other-- "if they only knew..."
HAROLD	I don't have rabies. Kumar stands up quickly.
KUMAR	Great, let's get out of here. Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT...
MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (O.S.)	Kumar!!! Kumar know that voice all too well...
KUMAR	Shit.
HAROLD	Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.
KUMAR'S FATHER	I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am I.
SAIKAT	What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar? Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a beamer. And I get laid whenever I want. You can have all that too, if you'd just get off your ass and go to med school.
KUMAR	Eat my balls, Saikat.
SAIKAT	God, you're 22 years old already! When are you gonna grow up and stop with this post-college rebel bullshit? Like your life is so tough. Kumar doesn't have a response. Saikat's right.
KUMAR'S FATHER	I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one I'm setting up for you. If I hear from Dr. Wein that you were anything short of spectacular, I'll completely cut you off!
KUMAR	Oh, come on, dad!
KUMAR'S FATHER	"Daddy will not be coming on anything!" You will be there and you will behave! I've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up. KUMAR lowers his head. He's been put in his place.
KUMAR	You're right. I'm sorry. KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug. He even gives SAIKAT a hug.
KUMAR	It won't happen again.
KUMAR'S FATHER	Good. I'll speak with you tomorrow. KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he
HAROLD	Wow. So I guess you're going to med school after all, huh?
KUMAR	Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don't need his money!
HAROLD	But...you just hugged him...
KUMAR	I just needed to get my hands on these... KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS.
KUMAR	Two words-- medical marijuana. HAROLD shakes his head in disgust.
KUMAR	Look, I'm telling you, they see an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and they'll just assume we're doctors. Then we walk right into the pharmacy and get the weed. Harold does not appear happy he's doing this.
HAROLD	If we get caught, you're taking the blame. This wasn't my idea.
KUMAR	We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned. All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked
MALE NURSE	Dr. Patel, thank God I found you! I need your help immediately! The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room...
HAROLD	What the hell's going on here?
KUMAR	He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry. Leave the talking up to me. On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST.
MALE NURSE	The patient was brought in by EMS five minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen. No exit wounds. HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest.
HAROLD	Oh shit! This guy's gonna die!!!
MALE NURSE	It's a good thing I found you two. All the other surgeons are working on other patients... The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument.
HAROLD	Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all wrong. We're not doc... KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.
KUMAR	What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest. HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.
MALE NURSE	Alright. I'll get the anesthesiologist. The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.
KUMAR	Hold on. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.
MALE NURSE	Marijuana? But why...
KUMAR	We don't have time for questions! We need marijuana now! Get as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it! KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.
MALE NURSE	But doctor, we don't have marijuana in this hospital. HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look.
KUMAR	Shit. Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest.
MALE NURSE	We're losing him! You gotta do something!
KUMAR	Very well. I guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way. KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face.
KUMAR (CONT'D)	First, we need to clear his C-spine. I want stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we need 2 units of O neg on board. Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's
MALE NURSE	Doctor! The patient is desatting! Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...
KUMAR	Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat! After a couple seconds go by...
KUMAR	What's taking so long?
MALE NURSE	Great catch doctor! His sat is up to 94! Kumar is cool and collected. He turns to the YOUNG MEDICAL
KUMAR	Will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up? A chorus of "yes, doctors."
KUMAR	Well, it looks like my work here is done.
KUMAR (CONT'D)	Say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here, do you?
HAROLD	I'm telling you. That was amazing! Even your dad would've been impressed!
KUMAR	Yeah. It wasn't bad.
HAROLD	This is perfect! We're back on the road. We have directions now. The rain let up. And guess what...
HAROLD	I'm officially done with my work. I'm telling you, things are finally starting to go our way. While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his
KUMAR	Hey, check it out! Your movie's playing. Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater
KUMAR	And look who went to see it... Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA
HAROLD	Holy shit.
KUMAR	You see? You thought you two had nothing in common. But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies. Hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to White Castle?
HAROLD	No way. Forget about it. Just drive. Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his
KUMAR	Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you "this is a sign."
HAROLD	Stop it.
KUMAR	Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way...
HAROLD	Let's just go! KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.
HAROLD	What are you doing?!
KUMAR	Hey Maria! MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN
KUMAR	Hey, get your hand off the gas! Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas. Just then,
KUMAR	Oh shit! Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING
HAROLD	You asshole! My car's probably all scratched up now!
KUMAR	Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us off the road!
HAROLD	I told you I didn't want to speak to her! Whatever. Let's jut get back on the highway.
KUMAR	Fine. KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a "POP!" Harold and
HAROLD	Godammit. You know how to change a flat?
KUMAR	Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire. Harold looks in his trunk for the spare. It's missing.
HAROLD	Where's my spare tire?
KUMAR	I don't know.
HAROLD	Shit, where the hell is it? Kumar suddenly remembers...
KUMAR	Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float?
HAROLD	What bridge? What the hell are you talking about?
KUMAR	Oh shit. That's right. I was with Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day. My bad.
HAROLD	Your bad? What are the hell are we gonna do now?! Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their
UGLY MAN	You boys need some help? The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is
HAROLD	Thanks for helping us out.
FREAK SHOW	No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself, "what would Jesus do?" Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a
FREAK SHOW	So, you boys worship Christ? The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.
HAROLD KUMAR	Uh...Yeah. Sure, he's great.
UGLY MAN	Great. Good to hear it. The name's Randy...but everyone calls me Freak Show.
KUMAR	I'm Kumar. This is Harold. Good to meet you, Mr...Freak Show.
FREAK SHOW	Pleasure's all mine. After a while, HAROLD starts to notice that they're driving
HAROLD	So where exactly are we going? Don't worry. My place isn't too far from here. Once we get there, I'll have your ride fixed up in a jiffy. The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a
KUMAR	Eww-- check out those boils on his neck!
KUMAR	Oh my God! You gotta look! One of them's actually pulsating!
HAROLD	Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you! KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.
KUMAR	Now there's some sort of puss! It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen!
HAROLD	What's the matter with you? You think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? He's two feet away from us. He can hear this entire conversation. He can hear me talking right now.
KUMAR	Don't worry, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear. HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then
FREAK SHOW	I heard every word you said. FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't
FREAK SHOW	Now it's gonna take me a little while here, so if you boys like you can go inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have something to drink, watch tv-- anything you want. Mi casa es su casa. Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do. FREAK SHOW gives HAROLD a pat on the back and starts changing
KUMAR	Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife?
HAROLD	He couldn't have said that.
KUMAR	But he did! It may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day. They reach the front door and are about to enter...
HAROLD	Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What do you think his wife is gonna look like?
LIANE	Hi. I'm Freak Show's wife, Liane. Would you boys like some pink lemonade? HAROLD and KUMAR can't move. They're awestruck.
LIANE	Let me go bring in a pitcher. LIANE leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she
HAROLD	Okay. It's official. We've entered the Twilight Zone.
KUMAR	Dude, Liane is fucking hot!
HAROLD	She's not ugly. LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade. She pours them
KUMAR	Thanks. So, tell me Liane-- how are things between you and Freak Show presently?
LIANE	Oh, never been better. We love each other very much. KUMAR looks disappointed. HAROLD, however, is intrigued...
HAROLD	Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak Show...end up with a woman like yourself?
LIANE	Well, I met him at choir practice `bout four years ago. Freak Show was very shy back then-- you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck. But he had the most amazing voice -- like a baby canary. Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
LIANE	Well, one day after Easter service, I told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out. The rest is history. And we've been in love ever since. HAROLD ponders this for a moment. He and KUMAR begin
LIANE	So you boys gonna fuck me or what? HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They
KUMAR	Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first?
HAROLD	Wait a second-- what about Freak Show...and this whole Christian thing you guys have going on?
LIANE	Oh, so just because we're passionate about our Lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time?
HAROLD	No, I just... Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and
HAROLD	Nevermind. Okay, rock, paper, scissors...
LIANE	Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time.
HAROLD	Huh?
LIANE	Come on. Give me the double stuff. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused.
KUMAR	I'm not sure we quite understand...
LIANE	I want you both inside me simultaneously. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and
KUMAR	Um, are we talking about one hole or two?
LIANE	However you want to do it.
HAROLD	Sorry, no thank you.
KUMAR	Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad. Shotgun anus!
HAROLD	Forget it! I don't want our balls rubbing against each other. No way! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...
KUMAR	What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow jobs!?
LIANE	Well...okay. Can you help me with this...? Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous
LIANE	Do you want to play with them? Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...
HAROLD	Okay, let's do that. Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a
FREAK SHOW	Hey boys-- I changed your tire... FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE...
FREAK SHOW	What the hell are you doing with my wife!
HAROLD	Uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar!
FREAK SHOW	I most certainly did not say that!
KUMAR	No. You did. We both heard you.
FREAK SHOW	Are you sure?
KUMAR	Positive. FREAK SHOW ponders this.
FREAK SHOW	Oh...my mistake then.
KUMAR	No problem.
FREAK SHOW	Well, since we're all here, why not make it a foursome?
FREAK SHOW	Who wants the first reach-around?
KUMAR	Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened.
HAROLD	Agreed.
KUMAR	Dude, I have no idea where we are. All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead.
KUMAR	Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?
HAROLD	And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy? Kumar pulls over to the side of the road...
KUMAR	Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know how to get us back on the highway.
HAROLD	Fuck that! It's my car! We're not picking up a hitchhiker! The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car.
NEIL	Yo, man, thanks for picking me up. HAROLD and KUMAR look at NEIL and then look at each other.
HAROLD	Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil Patrick Harris?
NEIL	Yep.
KUMAR	Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was my favorite TV show growing up! You were my idol!
NEIL	Hey, that's great. Do you think we could get going? I'm bored as shit back here. We see Harold's Infiniti drive back onto the road...
KUMAR	So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?
NEIL	Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show.
KUMAR	Even the chick who played the hot nurse?
NEIL	No, I didn't go all the way with her.
HAROLD	Hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you?
NEIL	I don't even know where the fuck I am right now. I was at this party earlier tonight, and this dude hooked me up with some killer X. Somehow I ended up getting thrown out of a moving car, and I've been tripping balls ever since. HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange.
KUMAR	Well, our night's been pretty crazy too. We've been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked.
NEIL	Dude, forget White Castle. What we need is some pussy.
HAROLD	Huh?
NEIL	It's a fucking sausage fest in here. Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll go to White Castle.
KUMAR	You don't understand, Neil. We've been craving these burgers all night.
NEIL	I've been craving burgers too. Fur burgers, that is. Let's pick up some trim at a strip club. The Doogie line always works on strippers. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- weirded out.
KUMAR	Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop and get directions. KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET
HAROLD	We'll be right back, Neil. NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start
HAROLD	What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why's he so horny?
KUMAR	I don't know. But we can't let him interfere with our quest. Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have
COLE	Late night math league meeting, homos?
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1	Extreme!
HAROLD	Oh shit. These idiots. Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk
INDIAN CASHIER	Please...the pies...do not... Cole and the Punks ignore him. Harold and Kumar then
HAROLD	Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.
KUMAR	He probably can't speak English... Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
KUMAR	Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes. HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...
HAROLD	Huh? Oh, good.
EXTREME KAYAKING!!!	HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and
COLE	That was so fucking extreme, man!
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1	Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten-- one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine point five. Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI.
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1	Extreme Cheddar! He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth, The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling. Cole picks up the
COLE	Extreme Cashier!!! Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER
HAROLD	Somebody should do something.
KUMAR	Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something.
EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS	Oooooooooh! Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the
HAROLD	I didn't mean you should do something. Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit
KUMAR	Shit. Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.
COLE	Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking with me one more time. Just try it! Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.
KUMAR	Come on, lets get out of here. Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated. With their
COLE	Thank you, come again!
HAROLD	Kumar-- you okay?
KUMAR	Yeah, I just hate those dicks. Fuck it. At least now we know where we're going. I'm so friggin' hungry...
HAROLD	Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car?
KUMAR	I think he did. You! You had to pick up a hitchhiker!
KUMAR	Rold, calm down!
HAROLD	Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?!
KUMAR	I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to know that he'd fuck us over?
HAROLD	This is all your fault! This whole fucking night! You know I leased that car! They're gonna make me pay for it! Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.
KUMAR	Where are you going?
HAROLD	I'm going to call the police! I don't want to talk to you anymore! Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and
KUMAR	There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes.
KUMAR	So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right?
HAROLD	I'm not speaking to you. Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It
KUMAR	You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to the first press. Every press after that is extraneous.
HAROLD	Thank you, Mr. Wizard. HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't
HAROLD	Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency? The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the
KUMAR	This is ridiculous. Just walk across.
HAROLD	It'll change in a second. They stand there for another ten seconds. It doesn't change.
KUMAR	Come on, there's not a car in sight!
HAROLD	Alright fine. You want me to cross? I'll cross. Just leave me alone! Harold starts walking angrily across the street.
KUMAR	Finally.
HAROLD	Shit! Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as
HAROLD	Good evening. Is there a problem, Officer...Palumbo?
OFFICER PALUMBO	Is there a problem? Ever hear of jaywalking?
HAROLD	Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll never do it again.
OFFICER PALUMBO	Yeah, like I give a fuck. I'm writing you up a ticket. OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket. Kumar walks over,
KUMAR	A ticket?! Are you serious? Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up!"
OFFICER PALUMBO	Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
HAROLD	Let me apologize for my friend. I promise I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm glad you're here. You know the TV show Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car and...
OFFICER PALUMBO	Pipe down and give me your ID.
KUMAR	Wait. Hold on. How can you give him a ticket for jaywalking? I mean, look at this street! He wasn't causing traffic or anything!
HAROLD	Kumar, shut up...
OFFICER PALUMBO	Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass.
KUMAR	Bust my ass?!
OFFICER PALUMBO	Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass. What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with like three o's and shit. What happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave, Jim... Harold points to his ID.
HAROLD	Harold. Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.
OFFICER PALUMBO	Yes. Harold. That's a great name. You should be proud of that name, son.
HAROLD	Thank you. OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk
OFFICER PALUMBO	As you were, ladies. Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it.
KUMAR	220 dollars!? Are you crazy? Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.
HAROLD	Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't...
KUMAR	No, no, no. I understand what's going on.
OFFICER PALUMBO	Hey, hands down! No sudden moves! Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with
KUMAR	Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, "How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true. Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed.
KUMAR	Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up! With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees
HAROLD	Oh shit.
HAROLD	Hey, are you gonna do something about my car? Hello? Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE
OFFICER PALUMBO	Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S MOM	Well, thank you for being so understanding about Bradley. I promise you he won't ever do it again.
OFFICER PALUMBO	Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the talk we had, right Brad? Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE	Mom-- please take me home... The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...
HAROLD	Can I at least give you my car's licence plate number? Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...
RADIO ANNOUNCER	The search for the escaped cheetah continues tonight. It was last spotted in Randolph Township, heading South... Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the
HAROLD	So what are you in here for?
TARIK	For being black.
HAROLD	Come on. Seriously. TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his
TARIK	I am serious. You wanna know what happened? Harold nods.
TARIK	I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore, since I'm black, it was probably me, right? Harold shrugs his shoulders.
TARIK	Well that was the logic the cop used. I told him I haven't even been to Newark in months. Then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. I said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything." So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting.
HAROLD	Holy shit. What did you do?
TARIK	I kept saying, "I understand that I'm under arrest. Please stop beating me." But that didn't work. Then another cop showed up. Then another. When it was all said and done, it took nine cops to bring me in here.
HAROLD	That fucking blows! Tarik nods and continues reading his book. Harold sees that
HAROLD	I don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this.
TARIK	Son, I'm fat. I'm black. I can't dance. And I have two gay fathers. I've had people messing with me my whole life. I learned a long time ago, there's no point in getting all riled up every time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time. Because in the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should.
TARIK	So what are you in here for?
HAROLD	Assaulting an officer.
TARIK	They tried to pin that shit on you too?
HAROLD	No. I actually did hit the cop. But only because I was trying to hit my friend. Well, ex-friend.
OFFICER REILLY	Hey, listen up guys! Multiple gun shots fired in Millbrook Park! It sounds bad!
OFFICER PALUMBO	Finally, some action! I'm going! Another cop, OFFICER MARTONE, gets up...
OFFICER MARTONE	No-- I'm going! All six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run
HAROLD	That was strange. Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a VENTILATION
HAROLD	What the hell was that? Rold? Is that you?
HAROLD	Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?!
KUMAR (O.C.)	Are the cops still there?
HAROLD	No, they... Wait a second, did you...
KUMAR (O.C.)	I called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook park...
HAROLD	Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?!
KUMAR (O.C.)	I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out, and we'd get over to White Castle.
HAROLD	Forget it! I don't want to get in any more trouble! I'm already in here because of you! Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to do? Stand there and take the hit? You know, I've never taken a swing at you before. Never.
HAROLD	Well, I never got your car stolen!
TARIK	Hey, I'm trying to read here.
KUMAR (O.C.)	Look, Rold, I'm sorry. But you're not the only one dealing with shit. My dad's cutting me off, remember?
HAROLD	Hey asshole, I'm in jail! Don't bitch to me about your problems! Just leave me alone. I don't want your help.
KUMAR (O.C.)	You don't want my help? Fine! I'm outta here! Uh...Rold? How do I get out of here? Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.
HAROLD	How the hell should I know? This isn't good. We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE
HAROLD	Jesus Christ. Tarik shakes his head.
KUMAR	Ow...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.
KUMAR	You sure you don't want to get out?
HAROLD	And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report,
KUMAR	So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second.
HAROLD	Fine. Hurry up. Kumar smiles. He begins searching for a key.
KUMAR	Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one will...
HAROLD	Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple
KUMAR	What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on
HAROLD	Kumar?...Kumar! Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a
HAROLD	What the hell are you... Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room,
OFFICER PALUMBO	You thought you could get away with this, huh?
NATHANIEL	Where am I? I was in bed. I didn't fire any gun, I swear... Suddenly, Officer Reilly looks over to the jail cell...
OFFICER REILLY	Look! All the cops turn to the cell. Kumar is still holding the
OFFICER PALUMBO	Shit! Jackson's trying to escape! Tarik looks up from his book...
TARIK	What? Oh, not again! The cops handcuff Nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run
OFFICER PALUMBO	Stop trying to escape!
TARIK	I'm not trying to escape! Look at me, I'm sitting down! They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm
OFFICER REILLY	He's trying to break free! Hold him tight! In the midst of all the action, Kumar grabs Harold and pulls
HAROLD	Wait-- shouldn't we do something about this?
NATHANIEL	If I were you, I'd get out of here as soon as possible. With that, Harold and Kumar run out...
KUMAR	Hurry up!
HAROLD	Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking mad house! Thanks for getting me out of there, dude.
KUMAR	Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there. Dude, look at this. It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires.
HAROLD	What was that?
KUMAR	Just a coyote. Don't worry.
HAROLD	Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes?
KUMAR	That's only because they sound scary. In one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down.
KUMAR (CONT'D)	Now cheetahs, they're another story. The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.
HAROLD	We're gonna die.
KUMAR	Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. They're not known for eating humans.
HAROLD	We're gonna die.
KUMAR	Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign. But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone. HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins
HAROLD	This isn't working.
KUMAR	Shhh. Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON
HAROLD	
KUMAR	I thought I told you not to take that jerky! HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't
HAROLD	He likes me. Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up...
KUMAR	Dude, I think I have an idea.
HAROLD	What is it?
KUMAR	I'll tell you, but first we have to get really high. Kumar opens the bag of weed. Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse. We see smoke
HAROLD	Has it come to this? Are we really gonna ride this cheetah?
KUMAR	Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. It's as good as a car. Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.
HAROLD	This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done.
KUMAR	Well, we'll soon find out. Mush! Mush!
HAROLD	Dude, am I just really high or is this is actually working?!
KUMAR	Both!
HAROLD	This is great! We'll be at White Castle in no... Along the way, they run by... The BLACK GUYS from the BASKETBALL GAME, all waltzing with Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill,
MARIA	I love you, Harold.
HAROLD	I love you, Maria. MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her.
COLE (O.S.)	Wow, you guys are really extreme... HAROLD turns and sees COLE KAYAKING DOWN A NEARBY STREAM...
COLE	...extremely gay that is.
MARIA	Oh Harold! Yes! Yes! Oh, God-- you have the biggest dick of all time! It's so long! And wide, for that matter!
MARIA	Don't worry about him... MARIA rolls over so SHE'S ON TOP OF HAROLD. SHE STARTS What the hell are you doing?!!!
KUMAR	I'm sorry! You've been out cold for the past half-hour! I figured that maybe if I did some gay shit you'd wake up. HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he
HAROLD	What happened to the cheetah?
KUMAR	It ran away. But forget about that. I have some bad news and some worse news.
HAROLD	Tell me the worse news first.
KUMAR	I checked out some road signs. The cheetah took us in the wrong direction.
HAROLD	That sucks. What's the bad news?
KUMAR	Your laptop is completely destroyed. Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag,
KUMAR	It smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah.
HAROLD	Why the hell didn't you say that THAT was the "worse news"?
KUMAR	Well, the laptop really only effects you. Whereas the White Castle situation effects both of us equally.
HAROLD	Oh no! No! No!
KUMAR	Don't worry, dude. Your laptop's insured.
HAROLD	It's not that! All my work was saved in there! Now I gotta go back to the office and re-do everything!
KUMAR	Exactly. First, we'll take a cab over to White Castle, then we'll...
HAROLD	Forget White Castle. There's no time!
KUMAR	Come on, Rold! You can get that shit done in a couple hours. We can't quit now!
KUMAR	Fine...We'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office. Harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods "yes." Kumar, disappointed, walks down the road with a miserable
KUMAR	Look, there's a Krispee Kreme. We'll call from there.
KUMAR	Oh great. Here we go again. COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the
COLE (O.S.)	Hey Apu! COLE laughs. Kumar tries to ignore him...
COLE	Who's running the Quik-E-Mart while you're gone? COLE pounds fists with his friends.
KUMAR	Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something
HAROLD	Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside,
HAROLD	I want that.
KUMAR	What? A chocolate cream filled?
HAROLD	No. I want that feeling. The feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires. I NEED that feeling.
KUMAR	Are you saying what I think you're saying?
HAROLD	We gotta go to White Castle. KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug.
KUMAR	Yes! I knew you had it in you! Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else
KUMAR	Is that Cindy Kim? Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein.
KUMAR	You should have boned her when you had the chance. Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head
HAROLD	Hey, why don't you just leave us alone?
COLE	Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it, Mr. Miagi? Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID...
HAROLD	Nothing. Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee
KUMAR	Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit!
HAROLD	Don't worry. The universe tends to unfold as it should. Kumar gives a "What the fuck is he talking about?" look.
HAROLD	Besides, I have a plan. Follow my lead...
KUMAR	Your lead? Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1	Hey, Cole! Look! Cole turns to see Harold in his car. Kumar is about to get
KUMAR	What the hell are you doing?!
HAROLD	I'm stealing their car.
KUMAR	This is your plan?
HAROLD	It's working isn't it?
KUMAR	Hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they think they have a chance to catch up.
KUMAR	Thank you, come again! Harold guns it-- leaving Cole and the Punks in the dust.
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1	Dude, that was so NOT extreme!
COLE	I know Extreme Sports Punk #1, I know. The Extreme Sports Punks walk away, leaving Cole by himself.
KUMAR	Victory is sweet! Nice job, Roldy!
HAROLD	I had to do something. KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air...
KUMAR	Wait. Do you smell that? KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He
KUMAR	Those assholes got to have White Castle?!
HAROLD	This world is so unfair.
KUMAR	Don't worry . Forget about that. We have a car now. We're back in the game. Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White Castle. Want me to drive?
HAROLD	No. I've got everything under control. We should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast. Just find us some tunes. A tape is resting in the tape deck. KUMAR pushes it in...
KUMAR	Those guys are fucking posers!
KUMAR	Dude, we're almost there!
OFFICER BRUCKS	Bingo.
KUMAR	Oh shit! KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them.
OFFICER BRUCKS	I found them. And I'm gonna need back-up.
OFFICER BRUCKS	Oh boy! We got a chase on our hands!
KUMAR	What are you doing?!
HAROLD	I'm not going back to jail! We've come too far! Now buckle up.
KUMAR	Buckle up? Kumar buckles his seat belt. HAROLD MAKES A SHARP TURN...
OFFICER BRUCKS	What the hell? He puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car and looks around wondering
KUMAR	Where the hell are we going?!
HAROLD	Just hold on! Harold and Kumar are still bouncing up and down...
KUMAR	It's a good thing I have an empty stomach, or else I'd puke right now!
HAROLD	Don't worry. We're gonna make it. Everything's gonna be...
HAROLD KUMAR	Shit! Fuck!
KUMAR	Rold! Look out there!
HAROLD	Oh shit! We're trapped! Kumar notices something...
KUMAR	Not necessarily. KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER...
HAROLD	No. No way. Not a chance. I'd rather turn myself in than die.
KUMAR	Dude, it's okay. I used to hang-glide with my dad all the time when I was kid. I know how to do it.
HAROLD	You hang-glided? I don't remember that.
KUMAR	We did it on our trips to India. I swear. I know exactly what I'm doing. I've even done it with two people at the same time. My brother and I did it. Just hold onto the outside bars and let me take care of the rest.
HAROLD	No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye...
KUMAR	You think this just about the burgers, huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about far more than that. KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
KUMAR	Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very, very hungry. And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. A land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. A land filled with hamburger stands. And not just one type of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. That land was America.
KUMAR	You think this is just about the burgers? No. This is about achieving what our parents set out for. This is about the pursuit of happiness. This is about the American dream. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.
KUMAR	And so we've reached this point. The point which all men eventually have to face. The point of no return. We can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle. Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. I leave the decision up to you. From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are
HAROLD	I hate you, Kumar.
HAROLD	Hurry up...they're almost here!
KUMAR	Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on tight. HAROLD does as he's told. They are both holding onto the
KUMAR	Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On the count of three, we're gonna run to the edge of the cliff. When I say "jump," launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got it?
HAROLD	I think so.
KUMAR	Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine. Are you ready? HAROLD's too nervous to speak. KUMAR gets into position.
KUMAR	Okay, here goes. One...two...three! HAROLD and KUMAR START RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLIFF.
KUMAR	Good job, Rold! Keep running!
KUMAR	Rold, there's something I gotta tell you. I've never hang-glided before.
HAROLD	Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
KUMAR	Dude, it's working!
HAROLD	I can't believe you lied to me!
KUMAR	Hey, how else was I gonna convince you to jump off a cliff?
OFFICER BRUCKS	It appears they've escaped. They ditched their jeep. OFFICER BRUCKS opens the front door of the car and peers
OFFICER BRUCKS	Good news. I found enough dope in the car to send those skateboard punks to jail for the next couple years. Looks like they've terrorized their last convenience store. Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth
HAROLD	Dude, we're so high right now.
KUMAR	We're not low. They continue gliding though the sky for a while...
HAROLD	Hey, Kumar?
KUMAR	Yeah?
HAROLD	How are we gonna get down?
KUMAR	Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go down at some point.
HAROLD	That's a great answer. Made me feel really comfortable. Thanks a lot. KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground.
HAROLD	Is it a problem if we fly into birds?
KUMAR	Why do you ask? DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 101.
HAROLD	Because we're about to! KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING
KUMAR	Oh shit! HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS. Numerous birds
HAROLD	Ahhhh! My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes!
KUMAR	We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
HAROLD	I hate you! I hate you so much!
KUMAR	We're gonna live! Ha! Ha! We're gonna live! You see, Rold? That wasn't so bad.
HAROLD	That's it...I'm gonna kill you...
KUMAR	Stop...I...can't...breathe...
HAROLD	That's the point!
KUMAR	Rold...
HAROLD	You're gonna die!
KUMAR	Rold...look!
KUMAR	We made it, dude.
TEENAGER	Looks like you guys had some night, huh? Harold and Kumar look at each other, and then back at the
HAROLD	I want thirty slyders. I want five french fries. I want four large Cherry cokes.
KUMAR	Same. Only make mine Diet Cokes.
TEENAGER	Wow. That comes to...forty-two dollars and seventy-five cents. HAROLD and KUMAR take out their WALLETS. THEY OPEN THEM UP.
HAROLD	Hey...hey...hey...where's my money?!
KUMAR	You don't have money?! Shit, I gave all mine to that asshole at Princeton! Fuck that hippie fuck! This can't be happening! We're so close and we're fucking broke!
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Let me take care of it. HAROLD and KUMAR turn around and see NEIL PATRICK HARRIS
KUMAR	What are you doing here?
NEIL	You guys kept talking about White Castle last night. It made me start craving it too.
HAROLD	Where's my fucking car you prick!
NEIL	Yeah. Sorry about that. Like I said, I was tripping balls last night. I don't know what came over me. Your car's out in the parking lot. Here are the keys. NEIL tosses HAROLD the car keys.
KUMAR	Do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car?
NEIL	I know. It was a dick move on my part. That's why I'm paying for your meal. Harold and Kumar look at each other, relieved.
HAROLD	Thanks, I guess. NEIL hands them some cash...
NEIL	Here's fifty for the meal, and two hundred for the car.
HAROLD	What happened to the car?
NEIL	I made some love stains in the back seat. You'll see. Anyway, take it easy guys. I'll see you around.
HAROLD	Where are you going?
NEIL	Wherever God takes me. With that, NEIL walks out of the restaurant. HAROLD and
TEENAGER	Hey guys...it's gonna take a little while to make all those burgers. You might as well sit down. HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to a booth and take a seat.
KUMAR	Dude, we're here. Isn't it great?
HAROLD	I know. I can't believe we made it. AND we got the car back! If we can just get out of here in a half hour, I can get back to my office and get the work done.
KUMAR	Hey, look! KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant. On the
FEMALE ANCHOR	Today's top story...Rutgers professor Tarik Jackson and attorney Nathaniel Banks are suing the state of New Jersey for racial discrimination and police brutality. We go live to the municipal state courthouse in Muckleburg... Tarik and Nathaniel have a bunch of microphones in front of
TARIK	What happened last night was a complete moral travesty. My family and I are outraged and will not settle for anything less than justice...
NATHANIEL	And by justice, we mean somewhere in the ballpark of ten million dollars....
HAROLD	Hey, good for those black guys! We see footage of OFFICER PALUMBO and THE OTHER COPS taken
OFFICER PALUMBO	I'm not racist! This is bullshit! If those black bastards think they're gonna get away with this, they've got another thing coming! Me and my white buddies are gonna [bleep] them up! Officer Palumbo gets shoved forcefully into the back of a Harold and Kumar enjoy this.
FEMALE ANCHOR	This just in...police have arrested a gang of hooligans... We see a picture of COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS in the
FEMALE ANCHOR	...after they found their abandoned car in the forest in Clifton, containing a large bag of marijuana. The young men could face up to five years in prison. HAROLD and KUMAR slap five.
FEMALE ANCHOR	And finally...the Muckleburg Police Department has informed us that they ARE STILL looking for ANOTHER FUGITIVE who escaped from the Police Station last night, along with a companion, believed to be his accomplice... HAROLD'S JAW DROPS. He's scared shitless.
FEMALE ANCHOR	Police have made the following sketch of the two fugitives, which they believe to be quote "extremely accurate."
TEENAGER	Hey, guys...I got your orders! HAROLD and KUMAR run out of the booth.
KUMAR	Wait...let's do it together.
HAROLD	Oh...that hit the spot.
KUMAR	It was the best meal of my life.
HAROLD	Mine too. The two of them sit there, looking at all the empty
KUMAR	Dude, you know what? I think I may actually go to my interview today.
HAROLD	Seriously?
KUMAR	Yeah. You know, my whole life I've been afraid being just another nerdy Indian guy turned doctor. Well, tonight got me thinking...
KUMAR	There are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine... HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE
KUMAR	Like having boils all over your face. Or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through.
HAROLD	Uh-huh.
KUMAR	Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. Somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris, I realized that I've always wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been too scared to admit it. KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...
KUMAR	Hey, Rold, are you listening to me? I'm having a major epiphany here.
HAROLD	I'll be right back... At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with
J.D.	Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what?
BILLY	I'll be there in a second... J.D. and TRACY check out the menu. BILLY takes ZOE aside--
BILLY	Look, I have to admit something to you. At the start of last night, all I really cared about was getting some. But then I met you, Zoe. You're so different from all the other women I've ever met. You're smart, funny, artistic. I guess what I'm trying to say is...
HAROLD (O.S.)	What the fuck is going on here? BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD...
BILLY	Harold? What are you...?
HAROLD	Never mind me. What are you doing here? I thought you and J.D. were busy all night with "clients." Isn't that why I had to do YOUR work?
J.D.	Hey! What the hell is going on here?
HAROLD	Back off, cock boy! What I have to say to him goes double for you! KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.
J.D.	Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just call me "cock boy?"
HAROLD	Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.
J.D.	Oh, I'm not quick enough? He thinks I'm not quick enough. Well, I got news for you... I am quick enough... ...cock boy! J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation.
BILLY	Listen Harry...
J.D.	Don't even bother with him. We'll just tell Berenson later...
HAROLD	Tell him what? That I'm your work horse! That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh? J.D. is stunned. Now he's a little nervous.
J.D.	No, no-- you don't understand...
HAROLD	No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing your work anymore. And if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to Berenson and tell him what's really going on. Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening...
HAROLD	And I'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore. TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out. They slowly
HAROLD	Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going. See you on Monday. HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows. Billy and J.D.
KUMAR	Way to go, Rold! Where the hell did that come from?
HAROLD	I don't know. Eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man. Now I'm actually looking forward to work this week.
KUMAR	No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after all.
HAROLD	I'm not worthless.
KUMAR	So those dudes have gonorrhea?
HAROLD	Beats me. Now, come on, let's get going.
KUMAR	What's the rush? There's plenty of time before my interview.
HAROLD	I have some unfinished business to take care of. They both get into the car (Harold gets in the driver's
KUMAR	Good luck, dude. KUMAR stands behind, while HAROLD approaches MARIA'S door.
LUIS	What do you want?
HAROLD	Oh...uh...nothing...wrong room.
WOMAN (O.C.)	Come back to bed!
LUIS	Hey, Papi's coming! Hold on! This girl is crazy, man. She seemed so sweet at first, but it turns out she's into some pretty freaky shit. She even did this thing where she took a lollipop and shoved it...
HAROLD	Look, I really don't need to hear it. I guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for interrupting you guys... Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING
LUIS	Hey-- if you're looking for Maria, she left for Europe this morning. Harold quickly turns around and runs back over.
HAROLD	Huh?
LUIS	She's going to Amsterdam for ten days. I'm Luis -- Maria's brother. Luis shakes Harold's hand. Harold suddenly feels better.
HAROLD	Oh! Maria's brother!
LUIS	You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps talking about.
HAROLD	Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she talks about me? A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string,
AISHA	Are you coming or what?
LUIS	Hey, I'll be there in a second, baby. Do me a favor-- make me that omelette you were talking about. You know, with the sun-dried tomatoes. Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. Luis gives
LUIS	So you want me to leave her a message or something?
HAROLD	Uh, no thanks. I'd rather do it in person.
LUIS	Then take it easy, hermano. Luis shuts the door. Kumar runs over to Harold...
KUMAR	Dude...we gotta go!
HAROLD	Huh? Where?
KUMAR	To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now and take the next plane.
HAROLD	What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? What about your interview with the med school guy?
KUMAR	Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule it. He won't have a problem, as long as I'm taking it seriously for a change. Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!
HAROLD	She's coming back in ten days! It's not like I'm never gonna see her again.
KUMAR	For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is the kiss of death. There are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her. By the time she gets back, she may not be available. Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying.
HAROLD	Forget it. I'll just wait till she comes back. Harold starts to walk away from Kumar...
KUMAR	Hey, Rold! Wait!
KUMAR	You do realize what's legal in Amsterdam, right?
FADE OUT.
