CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
SPECIAL FORCES LEADER	We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch.
COLONEL THOMPSON	Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero.
PENTAGON TECHIE #1	We have system control.
COLONEL THOMPSON	Activate laser mic.
CALLISTER	Is it him?
TRANSLATOR	Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ¢dialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei.
COLONEL THOMPSON	Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation.
CALLISTER	I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE	CIA and NCTC concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits.
TECHIE	Sire they're pulling off the highway.
TECHIE #2	We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The
COLONEL THOMPSON	If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.
CALLISTER	Alright, stay with him... THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune. INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints
TECHIE	We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles --
COLONEL THOMPSON	Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he
TECHIE	51%. 'Abort' rec holds. THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin
CALLISTER	What is that, a weapons cache?
ANALYST	Sir, the placement of stones around the pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam... I think it's a funeral. Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated.
TECHIE	Sir, striking a funeral would put us in violation of the Geneva convention.
COLONEL THOMPSON	Once this guy's gone, he's gone. The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in --
PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL	"Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open to international prosecution. But we have no independent intel verifying it's in fact a funeral, and the presence of weapons certainly leaves room for interpretation.
TECHIE #2	I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.
CALLISTER	Everyone agree this is the best course of action? No one dissents. Callister picks up:
CALLISTER (CONT'D)	Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some possibility he's at a funeral, but we don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks we can claim 'Overriding Legal Authority.' Also, you should be aware we have an abort recommendation, but your cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs urge a 'go.'
THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)	You left yourself out of the lineup. Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS
CALLISTER	Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one.
GENERAL THOMPSON	And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir, we're putting our people at risk. There's a long silence as the President considers.
THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)	I respect your caution, Geoff, but we won't get another chance like this... you have a green light. Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:
CALLISTER	Understood. We're weapons free. And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:

JERRY	Hey, Becky? When're you going to start wearing makeup? Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:
BECKY	.The collator's broken.
JERRY	Dude: no its not.
BECKY	Oh yeah it is, dude! She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own

MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	Jerry.
JERRY	Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God --
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes?
JERRY	-- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is.
JERRY	So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far ---
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands.
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)	You are hungry, I am guessing.
JERRY	Oh, no, no. I couldn't -- Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine.
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	So where is girl? I don't see her?
JERRY	Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart.
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	Like the others.
JERRY	Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered.
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up.
JERRY	Your -- I'm like your dog?
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:
JERRY	why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup --
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)	As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big. You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit:
JERRY	This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning --
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	-- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS.
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)	Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the

JERRY	Hey, mom... Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is
JERRY	-- no! I-- I'm not him! All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:
JERRY (CONT'D)	It's okay! I'm not Paul! Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew. A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:
RACHEL	Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I went over, I said no TV-- She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns

RACHEL	And your inhaler, which I may need to use now, is in the outside pocket -- wait!
KYLE	More bills?
RACHEL	Yup -- that's what happens when you have a kid on lay-away. They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC-- As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her:
I KNOW, I'M SORRY!	
KYLE	You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING
RACHEL:	Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab --
RACHEL	Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!!
WAIT!!	Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles:
MRS. MILLER	Under the wire --

MRS. MILLER	I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them.
RACHEL	You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more --
KYLE	It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya..
RACHEL	Fun? What's that? I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house.
KYLE	-- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller:
RACHEL	Call me!
MRS. MILLER	Your mom gonna be okay?
KYLE	It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor

JERRY	I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss.
WILLIAM	You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And
WILLIAM (CONT'D)	I want to give you some, uh...
JERRY	No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really well. I promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars. AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want

MRS. WIERZBOWSKI	I had to open your apartment, too many packages come, they come for hours --
JERRY	For me?
JERRY	-- hello? A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy.
WOMAN'S VOICE	Look out your window. They're coming for you.
JERRY	-- what? Who is this?
WOMAN'S VOICE	Jerry. You have to run.
JERRY	Who the hell is this?! Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack-
WOMAN'S VOICE	Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis train station. You have 4 minutes.
JERRY	Jesus Christ -- what's happening?!
WOMAN'S VOICE	Run, or you'll be captured and convicted -- go NOW. CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE. Jerry whirls,
TEAM LEADER JERRY	Hands behind your head! DOWN WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY! IS
JERRY	Look, man, I don't know what this is -- I don't know how all that shit got in my apartment, but unless you're my lawyer--
MORGAN	My condolences. I understand you've had a tough day.
JERRY	it hasn't been ideal.
MORGAN	Your brother worked for the State Department. This was almost a question. And while it's obviously news to
JERRY	You tell me.
MORGAN	Were you close?
JERRY	Why? What am I doing here. I don't even know who you are. Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal
MORGAN	Tom Morgan, Special Agent attached to the National Counterterrorism Center.
JERRY	Counterterrorism Center? You think I'm --
MORGAN	-- according to phone records, your brother called you twelve times in the last year. You never called him back.
JERRY	If you're asking if we were the kind of freaky twins you see at the mall wearing the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul traveled a lot, so we didn't --
MORGAN	Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in Karachi for a year. Then was a junior FSO in Beirut. Interesting places.
JERRY	What're you... saying.
MORGAN	I'm just saying you didn't talk much. maybe you did.
JERRY	Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause didn't hear my rights read to me--
MORGAN	You familiar with the slogan, "Declare War on War?"
JERRY	what? No, why? Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a
MORGAN	Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group "Project Underground" at Berkley.
JERRY	Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've gone to an "Anti-Oxygen" rally for her. I swear to God, dude--
MORGAN	Don't "dude" me. I'm not your friend. I don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd you drop out of school?
JERRY	Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I didn't really see the point.
MORGAN	You haven't been able to hold a job
JERRY	Unless I've been fired from Kinko's, which is a statistical impossibility, I'm holding a job right now.
MORGAN	Construction work, bartender in Singapore, telemarketing, real estate office, messenger, supermarket sign painter, taxi driver, gas station in Florida, fishing boat in Alaska--
JERRY	-- what can I say? Guess I haven't found myself yet --
MORGAN	Who deposited the seven-fifty?
JERRY	For as second I thought God, maybe. The ATM was obviously broken -- or do.. accidents not happen in your . universe?
MORGAN JERRY	The money originated from the --this is all -- listen, this corporation called 'The Star me! Do you understand? of Orion,' a dummy front for Hezbollah. This morning Majid -- alright, this is insane, I destruction are already inside our borders-- -- we find hardware in your -- I told you, it all just apartment, latest military showed up there'. You're not nitrate fertilizer. Just curious if you knew any of Paul's friends in Beirut, or if he knew any of your friends -- what do you mean in Singapore, oh but that's "friends"?! right, we haven't really established whether or not you -- I guess we were rett close when I looked into his open casket this morning and saw the bad make-up job covering the gash in his skull! Or how about when I watched him being lowered into the ground -- that establish anything for you?! Somebody set me up! Morgan stares at him, unmoved.
MORGAN	"Somebody." Who?
JERRY	A woman, I don't know! She called me and told me I was gonna be arrested. GET
MORGAN	No more than Abdul Hamid, Taliban POW we caught in Afghanistan. Except his real name was Johnny Walker Lindh. Grew up in Marin County with a basketball hoop in his driveway and a carton of Tropicana in his fridge. He was blonder than you.. though. When I come back, you'd better tell me who you work for-- And heads out the door, SLAM! Jerry yells;
LATESHA	He fits the profile: disaffected, 'susceptible to radical indoctrination, problem with authority. Doesn't vote or pay taxes, but witness statements all say he's not a player. He does sketches of his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying about the woman who called him -- we checked the records, no calls came in before we picked him up --
KREBS	What about the brother?
LATESHA	Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past three years. No red flags. He was killed when a truck ran a light in Crystal City.
MORGAN	That kind of equipment and a major cash infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying "coincidence?"
KREBS	So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or a dumbshit mule.
GRANT	Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle about him or the gear. He's not exactly a pro-- Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring
KREBS	Get Smith on financials; Rieger on travel; and let's dryclean family and friends. Again. I don't want the FBI rushing in on this. Break him. Fast. And leaves Morgan to twist.. The pressure's on. To Latesha:
MORGAN	v m m putting you on the brother.
LATESHA	Great, I'll access State's database
MORGAN	No, I want you to go there.
LATESHA	But, Tom, I can do everything from
MORGAN'S VOICE	you know those funny things underneath that not-so-stylish pantsuit? They're called leas. Latesha looks at him, not happy.
LATESHA	Yes. Sir.
MORGAN	You know I hate it when you call me that-- He turns to go, Grant immediately following him --
AGENT GRANT	What can I do?
MORGAN	Follow me and don't talk.
MICHAEL	He's out of town.
RACHEL	Yup.
MICHAEL	Which seems like a perfect ;opportunity for a second date. In theory.
RACHEL	In theory -- but I gotta site-check this brief, courier's coming in,.,the morning.
MICHAEL	Didn't we have a good time? Remember that? Our first date? Back in the 40's? He's so agreeably genuine, she wants to let him down easy:
RACHEL	I had a great. time, I told you that but I'm so busy and...
MICHAEL	Ooo.o, shit, the "so busy" speech -- stop -- not worthy of you. Or me. I'm patient, so... call me. When you're not busy.
RACHEL	Kyle goes to college in nine years-- it should be somewhere around then.
MICHAEL	I would so wait a decade for you. Call me his sophomore year, I'll prove it. And with a smile he heads off. She watches him go -- dammit! He gets in the elevator and she's left in her solitude. And now The consequence of not really letting anyone into her life. She
RACHEL	-- hello? It's the same chilling FEMALE VOICE:

STORE OWNER	You sure you want to replace it? Sounds pretty good to me. And we reveal MIDDLE EASTERN MAN standing at the counter. Eyes
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	Yes. I'm sure. Please do it now. The Store Owner looks into the box.
STORE OWNER	I do a lot of custom jobs, never seen something like this before. I can have it for you by the end of the week. The Middle Eastern Man. MUMBLING again in Tajiki. Seemingly,
STORE OWNER (CONT'D)	Sorry, what?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	No. Is not possible. it must be done this afternoon --
STORE OWNER	Listen, Mister -- The Middle Eastern Man suddenly touches his ear, BARKS out
STORE OWNER (CONT'D)	-- are you okay?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	I will pay you triple. Please. A courier will be by to pick it:'up at three. Do it, please... please. And stepping back, he exits quickly. The Store Owner watches
AGENT GRANT	All the surveillance cameras in the area have turned up nothing -- no ID on the girl, nothing on the VIN --
MORGAN	All I want is a goddamn picture of her -- what about traffic cams? There are more cameras on that route than the Super
AGENT GRANT	Department of Transpo says there was a seven minute equipment failure --
MORGAN AGENT GRANT	Do NOT tell me their equipment was down! Do NOT! Sir, that's what they're telling me... From Northbrook to the 290?! What about the bogus fax from Justice, was that equipment failure too? -- No sir, there's gotta be someone on the inside. -- ya think?! Pissed, Morgan starts -- fast -- for the chopper -- we move with
MORGAN	The getaway car was waiting there -- get me a witness description on the woman driving -- remember witnesses? People who see things?! Jesus, is this a lost art?
AGENT GRANT	I have Markey on that right now Morgan's PHONE IS RINGING -- he answers:
MORGAN	Morgan. When? NO. You tell them hold that 'til I talk to Sanford - WTMZ has a report that there's a terrorist at large in the.city,-- I'm going back to forensics. Find out where the hell that fax originated.-- if you don't have good news for me before I touch down you will be demoted to a job that will require you. to touch shit with your hands --do you understand me?
AGENT GRANT	Yes sir! As Morgan hops up onto the moving chopper --
MORGAN	Nobody who works for me calls me sir. understand?! It's disingenuous -- might as well be calling me 'asshole.' As Grant watches the chopper take off, perplexed.
RACHEL	So you're a twin. Who works at a copy place. And she manages a clipped, judgemental (frankly rude) laugh.
JERRY	Yeah, I know... that's occurred to me.
RACHEL	So this whole situation is obviously about him.
JERRY	Excuse me? I would offer this whole situation isn't "obviously" about anything.
RACHEL	Just think about it: you said your brother worked at the State Department --
JERRY	-- so what?
RACHEL	-- so that means he could've: been into anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals -- it seems to me that they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother--
JERRY	Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all that stuff was for Paul? As they approach TOWER 108:
RAC HE L	Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not trying to insult his memory --
JERRY	he hasn't been dead long enough to become a memory! And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying --
RACHEL	I'm implying if not him... then why you?
JERRY	Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist. What about you? Why'd she choose you -- what's your day job? I know it isn't "manual-shift driver."
RACHEL	I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a paralegal -- I have no connection to anything.
JERRY	Really? Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST
RACHEL	Someone's coming. And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	Are you Jerry Shaw?
JERRY	who are you? Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket --
JERRY (CONT'D) MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	-- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she said. I'm done. The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY.
JERRY (CONT'D)	-- dropped off what? Who are you?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	Take it -- He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between
JERRY	what's it for?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	I don't know -- I don't care -- but I will not drive you. You take the van I'm not listening to you any more! And the man turns to go, just walks away.
RACHEL JERRY	-- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You have to tell us what you know! And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches
JERRY (CONT'D)	What do you know?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	-- let me go!
JERRY	-- who's doing this? And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL
WOMAN'S VOICE	Stop him now or he will die.
RACHEL	How are you seeing us?! Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing.
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	Let go of me! On Rachel:
WOMAN'S VOICE	Stop him now. CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man --
RACHEL	Stop! You have to STOP! When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN	I cannot! I have a family!!!
RACHEL	She's going to KILL YOU! And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE --
RACHEL (CONT'D) JERRY.	Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something, God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what to.. what... And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer
JERRY	You killed him... you killed that man...
WOMAN'S VOICE	It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street. Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey and you die. CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry.
JERRY RACHEL	she wants us to drive to Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? -- -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep happening! We have to go to the police, explain it -- explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not gonna tell them?! going anywhere! Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders:
JERRY	-- Rachel. She's watching us. Right now. You wanna die too? Your son? We have to go. Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren
WEAPONS DEVELOPER	That blast was the result of one single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today, "Rex" is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers -- it's eighty times more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures:
COLONEL THOMPSON	Talk about the detonating system... The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of
WEAPONS DEVELOPER	Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible -- that was the tone you heard before the explosion -- the tone was the trigger.
CALLISTER	What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it? A song on a radio? A howling dog?
WEAPONS DEVELOPER	No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce.
COLONEL THOMPSON	Fine job.
WEAPONS DEVELOPER	Thank you, sir. We're proud of this ordnance -- all of us at Halloway-Smith.
WEAPONS DEVELOPER.(V.0.)	If you're satisfied with today's final test, the Hex Project has met every... contractual objective. The arms package each into separate . containers, fit them with
WEAPONS DEVELOPER (V.0.) (CONT'D)	And we're hoping this moves us into the next scheduled phase... shipping the product into the field. Drift toward an unmanned computer. The screen FLICKERS:
MORGAN (V.O.)	Whaddya got? Those funny things underneath my not-so- stylish pantsuit? They brought me all the way to the Pentagon. Paul Shaw wasn't State --
LATESHA (V.0.)	-- he was Defense.
MORGAN	You're kidding me. What capacity?
LATESHA (V.0.)	Black-file: classified B-36.
MORGAN	B what?
LATESHA	That's the point. No one'll tell me. I cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to the Intel committee, NSA gave me..nothing. Krebs doesn't want me to ruffle any feathers. I've been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I'm a -- WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping
MP	Interns aren't allowed on this floor, miss. You'll have to -- When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance,
M.P.	-- sorry.
LATESHA	Everybody in this place have a six-foot height requirement? Anyway. I'm going back to the office to--
MORGAN (V.0.)	No, no, no --
PILOT	-- I got the Williamson County Sheriff on the line -- Morgan holds up a hand, one second. To Latesha:
MORGAN	Look, I don't have time for this -- stay there til you get some answers -- -- but its a total shut out -- Simms: step up -- -- I don't care if you have to go to the. top to do it. Whatever means necessary, got it? Whatever means. CLICK. Latesha lowers the phone. A HUGE:PAINTING of the battle Latesha hesitates. For just a second. Shit. Shit. This is
LATESHA	Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the
LATESHA (CONT'D)	Well, shit.
JERRY	how old is he? Your son.
RACHEL	Kyle. He's nine.
JERRY	What's he doing on a train? She really doesn't want to talk. BUT:
RACHEL	He goes to a music magnet. His school's on a tour of Washington. They're playing at the Kennedy Center.
JERRY	wow. And you. Hm. She turns to him. Eyes burning into the side of his head.
RACHEL	Parents weren't allowed to go... is that okay with you?
JERRY	Is it okay? I could give a shit.
RACHEL	Then what's with the qualified nod?
JERRY	I'm not allowed to nod?
RACHEL	Not if you're iudging me.--
JERRY.	Judging?! I'm just making conversation.
RACHEL	You think I should have gone with him anyway.
JERRY	I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old -- playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it.
RACHEL	Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't there?
JERRY	Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you aren't -- would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad?
RACHEL	As if it's any of your business -- you know what you are --?
JERRY	Insightful? Intuitive? A better driver than you --?
RACHEL	-- you're one of those "thirties are the new twenties" man-children. You're glib and wry and find humor in people like me who are actually accountable for the ir lives --
JERRY	Okay, the most fascinating thing here? Is that you don't know the first thing about me!
RACHEL	I know you work at a copy store! What are you, thirty-one, thirty-two? You're obviously articulate
JERRY	-- love being stuck in a van with my fucking guidance counselor --
RACHEL	-- and I know your brother just died and he worked for the State Department --
JERRY	-- you need to stop talking about my brother, I've had enough of that --
RACHEL JERRY	-- you're in denial if you -- Ham: I'm not talking about don't think that has anything this -- to do with what's happening right now -= -- Dammit!! I'm not kidding! :but I can tell you that Stop! STOP! whatever he did, whatever he was part of has put my son in danger whether you believe it or not!! SCREECH! Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes Jerry gets out, SLAMS his door shut -- You can't leave me!
JERRY	Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and I'm a loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door
RACHEL	Don't walk away!
JERRY	I'm done.
RACHEL	Please!
JERRY	You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin :
RACHEL	Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear.
JERRY	I'm sorry? What'd you just say?
RACHEL	I can't do this without you.
JERRY	You mean without the "man-child?" Rachel's reserves crumble.
RACHEL	Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train-- -- I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's
JERRY	No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again --
RACHEL	Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van.
POWER WORKER	Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared.
SHERIFF	No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints.
MORGAN	And we're about 4 miles from the river -- Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on
AGENT GRANT	Agent Morgan!" Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice.
MORGAN	Inside?! You absolutely sure on that?
AGENT GRANT	Yes, s-- Yes I am.
MEDICAL EXAMINER	Got something -- As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a
GRANT	Looks like a bone mic, military grade.
MORGAN	Can't even get these things on the black market. Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten
SHERIFF	We'll be needing that for evidence!
RACHEL	a Federal bank?
JERRY	Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal Prison.
MANAGER	Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box.
JERRY	yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a
MANAGER	Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box
RACHEL	You gonna open it?
JERRY	Maybe it's not gonna be so bad.
RACHEL	Yeah... maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO
JERRY RACHEL	Oh, shit -- it's bad -- They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear:
WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC	Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase. Take it -- by force if necessary -- then exit the building.. Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know:
RACHEL	-- what?!
JERRY	-- I don't suppose -- there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want -- is there? Miss? But she's not answering.
JERRY (CONT'D)	Excellent.
RACHEL	What now -- what are we?
JERRY RACHEL	-- they're coming--we're supposed to rob them -- -- are you kidding me?!?! -- just take i t-- -- no! Jesus! I don't even let Kyle play with water guns! -- hey, I applaud your parenting skills -- take it! The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS
JERRY	Don't! The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly --
JERRY (CONT'D)	Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just -- we need the case.
COURIER #1	You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that.
JERRY	I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do it. The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip.
RACHEL (CONT'D)	Gimme the case. Now. They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it.
JERRY RACHEL	impressive. Thanks.
RACHEL JERRY	-- whoa--what is that? -- a timer -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that -- what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and... -- and bombs, you were gonna say bombs -- some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers... -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer -- What is SHE saying about it --? I dunno, I -- -- What do you mean you. don't know?!
WOMAN'S VOICE	You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not optimum. JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:
JERRY	Would you stop doing that?!
WOMAN'S VOICE	There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed.
JERRY	Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN--
RACHEL	How do I look?
JERRY	Like you got into a fight. Me?
RACHEL	Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel
JERRY	Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his
JERRY (CONT'D)	Two jerseys and two hats, please --
VENDOR	Peyton or Vinatieri?
JERRY	I don't know what that means --
RACHEL	Jerry...
JERRY	Uh... both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT
JERRY (CONT'D)	Put these on --
JERRY	Do it! They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium.
CHAUFFEUR	Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the game.
JERRY	Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry --
CHAUFFEUR	I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he
LATESHA	Afternoon... afternoon, sir... afternoon... afternoon, General... Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by
LATESHA (CONT'D)	Secretary Callister? He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:
LATESHA (CONT'D)	Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I need to ask you a question, sir --
CALLISTER	Not now, you can direct it to my office.
LATESHA	It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not --
CALLISTER	-- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds.
LATESHA	So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--?
LATESHA (CONT'D)	I just checked the intel, sir, we have some of the same indexes --
CALLISTER	You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling
LATESHA	Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by
LATESHA (CONT'D)	My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit
BELLHOP	Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please -- Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back:
JERRY	No! 2 trot it. Thanks, though.
BELLHOP	So, where'd you two get hitched?
JERRY RACHEL	Reno. Niagara Falls. Shit.
JERRY RACHEL	Niagara Falls. Reno. Shit. The "DING" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO:
SCOTT	Agent Simms? Scott Bowman: Welcome to B- 36. If you'll follow me?
BELLHOP	Welcome to paradise. Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the Minibar, high-speed internet, thousand- count sheets. And if you're looking for the TV He clicks a remote and a 72" PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet.
TV VOICE	dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort...
BELLHOP	Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please... And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still
JERRY	Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS
RACHEL	This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here?
JERRY	Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes -- He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it,
RACHEL	What're you doing?
JERRY	If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these!
RACHEL	Can you stop eating for a second? A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately.
WOMAN'S VOICE	Answer it. They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)	There are items you will need for the next step. KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the
DELIVERY BOY	There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just
WOMAN'S VOICE	The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance.
RACHEL	Where are we going now?
JERRY	What the hell's in the briefcase?
WOMAN'S VOICE	Your only consideration at present is to deliver it before the timer expires.
JERRY	BULLSHIT! This is crazy! You're a television set! You don't watch me, I watch you! I wanna know what the hell's going on!!
WOMAN'S VOICE	It would not be efficacious to reveal my intentions.
JERRY	-- "not be efficacious"?! Who the.fuck talks like that?!
RACHEL	-- Jerry --
JERRY	We know you're watching! We know you're listening! We know you knowâ¢.'everythina. So why don't you STOP HIDING AND TELL US
WHO YOU ARE!!	Nothing. Furious, he moves to.the WINDOW --
JERRY (:CONT'D)	Fine, have it your way,.Lady -- I'm gonna scream bloody murder out this window 'til every cop in a fifty mile radius comes running and I'm gonna tell them everything even if they think I'm a crazy sonofabitch 'cause at least I won't have to listen to you any more! He YANKS the window up -- He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK -- then IMAGES -- FILE FOOTAGE -- a DEFENSE DEPARTMENT LAB, TECHNICIANS
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)	My name... is Aria. Rachel and Jerry stare -- what the hell is this? It stands for 'Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Analyst'... And we reveal "THE TANK." A glassed-in wall containing TONS of
SCOTT (CONT'D)	Twenty-two hundred tons of super-cooled water keeps her from overheating -- that's ninety-two thousand processors, the equivalent of a hundred.millionhuman brains working together as:,.one..."'
LATESHA	an electronic espionage system.
SCOTT	No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off satellites. This goes.;. much farther.
ARIA	I was created by "DARPA": the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002. My primary directive is to protect the national security of the United States. I have access to track the economies, populations, and military development of every country in the world, as well as intercept all global communications -- from satellites to cell phones to credit card transactions. Jerry and Rachel look at each other -- a computer?!
SCOTT	After 911, our problem wasn't collecting data, it was interpreting it fast enough. Ergo: quantum rocessin
SCOTT (CONT'D)	Today there are more microchips than people, and they can all be data-mined, either via direct connectivity or wireless signals --let's say we're chasing someone with a suitcase nuke in L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass transit, track the perp through traffic cameras... and if given the order, she could even turn a TV into a bomb to take him out.
LATESHA	But what if --
SCOTT	-- she can't act without authorization. See, she's bound not to countermand our laws -- even the Declaration of Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role's pre-emptive -- running simulations, identifying threats before they become real...
JERRY	Wait, you think we're a.threat?
ARIA (V.0.)	No. You're a means to an end. On TV, CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS -- ZOOM to words in CLOSE UP:
ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Under National Security Directive 359, Sub-Section 72 -- "when units are needed for the national defense, civilians shall be ordered to active Federal service..."
JERRY	you're drafting us?
RACHEL	The guy you killed in the desert -- last time I checked, murder wasn't legal.
ARIA	In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know,
JERRY	what'd my brother have to do with this? A picture of PAUL SHAW'S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen:
ARIA	We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry.
JERRY	No, he worked for the State Department..:
ARIA	Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman.
JERRY	What's the hell is a 'Horseman'?
SCOTT	You know, clever allegory -- of the apocalypse'--`except we're here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID PHOTOS APPEAR of our four "Horsemen": Officially, we don't exist, but we monitor Aria's network 24/7. There were :four of us... til Paul died. He was smarter than all of us put together.
LATESHA	Working here must be pretty tough -- all the security, the pressure, long hours... As in: "Did you notice him acting strangely?"
SCOTT	Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except...
LATESHA	Except what?
SCOTT	The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue -- PRELAP:
ARIA (V.0.)	Paul and I had a disagreement before he expired...
ARIA	To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task. Simple. Expired?! You mean died.. That's what we call it, we humans, we call it dying--
RACHEL	To insure the national security of the United States.
RACHEL	What d'you need me for then?
ARIA (V.0.)	That is not your concern right now.
RACHEL	Are you kidding me?
JERRY	Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother.
ARIA (V.0.)	I know all about him, Jerry. And you.
ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Your brother succeeded in everything he did.
ARIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S,
ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D)	You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow. And because you've seen what happens to deserters.
RACHEL	-- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK. You have 23 minutes to prepare. There's an adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE clicks open.
ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Use it. And she's gone, replaced by the hotel's promotional prattle --
TV VOICE	The Four Seasons prides itself on excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an emotional beat... Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room
MAN'S VOICE	Halloway-Smith contracted us to transport the briefcase to their corporate office...
MORGAN	Biotech? The chemical company?
BRINKS COURIER #2	When they make a new compound, they, hold it in a vault for clinical trials.
MORGAN	Why'd the HAZMAT office issue a special permit for the case?
BRINKS COURIER #1	You'd have to ask -- could be` anything from a boner pill to a bioweapon, they never tell us.
BRINKS COURIER #2	Tell you one thing, though... the guy never handled a gun before. That LANDS with Morgan. He nods to an agent, dismissing the couriers. Grant approaches:
AGENT GRANT	We pulled video... nothing. No good angles on Shaw or the girl.
MORGAN	There.are 14 visible cameras in the lobby! " 8 hidden no one can see!
AGENT GRANT	Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them ahead of us.
MORGAN	It's a Federal bank; encryption doesn't get more secure.., from now on assume our air's been compromised, too. Tell everyone to go secure on Tac-3, nobody communicates outside this task force without my say-so.
AGENT GRANT	I'm on it -- also: they found this upstairs, but the trace signal's dead -- Holds up an evidence bag with Jerry's BONE MIC inside.
MORGAN	Do not tell me that is what I think it is. Goddamnit, who's leading these people around?! Someone's behind the Wizard of Oz! He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the
RACHEL	-- Kyle?!
KYLE	Hey, mom, it's. me.
RACHEL	-- sweetie, where areou, are you -- But she's INTERRUPTED as she realizes, oddly, it's a VOICEMAIL --
KYLE (V.O.)	Got your message, the train's awesome -- Brian tried to burp the alphabet but gagged when he got to "M." I'll call when we hit D.C. Bye, ma -- Rachel holding the phone like it's some kind of life-line to her
ARIA	Your son left that message sixty seconds ago.
RACHEL	I'll do whatever you want -- don't hurt him, please -- I'm begging you. Listen - you're trying to protect something too, right? You'll do whatever it takes. Well that's what it's like to be a mother -- can you understand that?
ARIA	There were over 52,000 vocal tone options for my program; I chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal. People tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother.
RACHEL	Jesus...
ARIA	You'll see your son again soon. Bute there's something I require from you first...
JERRY	Rachel? We gotta go INTERCUT: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying the horror
RACHEL	What? No way, I can't just --
ARIA	-- when the time comes I'll instruct you to stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear those words, you'll have thirty seconds.
JERRY (V.0.)	Rachel? You in there?
ARIA	Answer Jerry, please. INTERCUT:;Jerry still standing outside the door. Rachel's Steeling herself, she steps out. Forces a smile while averting
LATESHA	I dunno, the whole thing's off somehow - but get this: B-36 isn't a security classification, it's a sub-level here at the Pentagon -- What? Girl's gotta groom.
MORGAN	-- you're shitting me
LATESHA	Yeah, 36 floors underground -- and it gets weirder: INTERCUTTING WITH MORGAN IN THE 7-11 -- he hears:
LATESHA'S VOICE	Four years ago, DARPA commissioned... (garbled)... .computer... (garbled)...
MORGAN	Simms? You're breaking up -- WITH LATESHA -- her cell LCD says: "Call lost." No bars.
LATESHA/ARIA (V.0.)	Sorry about that -- As we realize Aria's taken over the call by mimicking Latesha:
LATESHA/ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D)	I'm getting a bad signal down here. I heard 'DARPA' and 'computer' --?
LATESHA/ARIA	Yes, B-36 was part of a super-computer project, but it was decommissioned. A dead end. The archives are at Fort Meade. Do you want me to head over there? -- but Morgan's only half-listening now as he sees. something on
MORGAN	Wait -- go back, freeze that - WHAT HE SEES: A STILL of Jerry and Rachel getting in the limo,
MORGAN (CONT.':D)	Punch up the plate The image enhances, revealing a PLATE NUMBER, its frame bearing
MORGAN (CONT'D)	Find that car! Simms, gotta jump, sit tight 'til I call.
LATESHA	Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to hang up. But stops: did she
SCOTT	Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every Aria, go voice active, please.
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)	Hello, Scott. How may I assist you?
LATESHA	It talks?
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)	I'm fluent in 6,800 languages, 41,000 dialects, and 750 extinct tongues.
SCOTT	Aria, this is Latesha Simms, she's here as part of a counter-terrorism task force.
ARIA OVER SPEAKER.(V.0.	A pleasure to serve you, Ms. Simms.
LATESHA	Am I supposed to -- Um... what's up.
SCOTT.	Aria, I'd like to:bring,up all the log feeds the night Paul died -- when he left the building.
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)	Of course. Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and-
LATESHA	There's no feed from inside here?
SCOTT	No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the
SCOTT (V.0.) (CONT'D)	So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day.
LATESHA	Except three minutes early... ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside.
LATESHA (CONT'D)	Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE --
SCOTT	Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and
ARIA. OVER SPEAKER (V.O.)	I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze.
SCOTT	Negative, I'm prioritizing this.
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)	I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED
LATESHA	It's like he's trying to say something...
SCOTT	A code. He's blinking code
LATESHA	It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it --
SCOTT	Oh, that sonofabitch... He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling It's a code -- Hexadecimal -- a number system that can be converted to letters the first computer used it as a programming language back in the 50's. Latesha watches, rapt: R... E. E... X... T. ."
SCOTT (CONT'D	The hell is that? Staring, minds spinning -- and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER
LATESHA	It's the only spot in the hallway not covered by .the cameras. He was hiding something from her. A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it
LATESHA (CONT'D)	I don't get it. He had to be saying 'Fire Extinguisher.' Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans --
SCOTT	Maintenance replaced it yesterday. This isn't right... they weren't supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes. She read the code too... where's 'Recyling'?
RACHEL	Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You didn't sleep?
JERRY	Night shifts. I'm used to. Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised.
RACHEL	Wow, is that me?
JERRY	One of my only party tricks.
RACHEL	It's really good. Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated. About what Aria said... I'm sorry. They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window...
JERRY	You have to understand, I wasn't his twin, I was more like his... little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you wouldn't believe how... nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did. Of course he was involved in some super secret National Security project. He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I'm the fuck-up. I wear it like a medal, like it actually means something... but the funny thing is? This is probably the most important thing I'll ever do. This. Right now. This completely insane journey or whatever it is. I'm actually needed in something, me. Jerry Shaw is required. But what am I thinking? I'll probably fuck this up, too --
RACHEL	You're being too hard on yourself--
JERRY	No. I'm not being hard enough. That's been the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic
CHAUFFEUR	Your passports and itinerary. Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry...
JERRY	Uh... could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding,
RACHEL	You don't think --
JERRY	-- we know what she can do, she doesn't need us to crash a plane --
RACHEL	-- what if it's not about just one plane? They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When
RACHEL (CONT'D)	I have more to lose in this. If anything happens to Kyle then my life's over But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case.
JERRY	Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to lose. We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it.
ARIA OVER P.A.	Allison Ackerman, please pick up the white courtesy phone -- They stop, hearing her. Rachel TENSES in this moment moves
ARIA (V.0.)	Go to the ticketing machine, you'll receive two tickets to Paris.
RACHEL	-- Paris?
ARIA (V.0.)	Once you have the tickets, walk to gate 17-C. Move quickly.
MORGAN	He's with a brunette female, approximately five-seven -- I want airport PD at all exits -- have the tower shift commander ground every flight outta here under Federal jurisdiction but don't change the departure boards, I don't want 'em to know we're coming-- The agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac --

RACHEL	she changed the screen... The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back:
TSA AGENT	Can't be too careful.

ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.)	You'll soon be loaded into the unpressurized hold of a cargo plane. The drug will lower your heartrate to 15 beats per minutes, reducing your need for oxygen... based on your medical records you have a 92% chance of survival. Their eyes go wide. Chests heaving as the drug takes effect.
RACHEL	.I feel it... oh, God...
JERRY	Hey, hey... look at me. She finds his eyes, it calms her.
RACHEL	I haven't really done... a lotta drugs.
JERRY	I've never done 'em in a cargo container. Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the

RACHEL	-- what?
JERRY	-- anything -- something personal, something you would rationally never tell a stranger like me
RACHEL	I don't know. : You're being sweet, but it's not working -
JERRY	-- where's you ex-husband? You didn't tell me before--
RACHEL	-- you're gonna distract me by bringing up my life's biggest mistake?
JERRY	-- how could it be your biggest mistake? You got Kyle out of it.
RACHEL	-- now you're gonna distract me by bringing up the one thing I'm most afraid of losing?!
JERRY	Where is he? Your ex-husband?
RACHEL	Jesus -- okay -- he's in the Wilmington Correctional Facility.
JERRY	-- what? Really? Why?
RACHEL	Mail fraud.
JERRY	Mail fraud? You married a -- mail fraudist? Or whatever?
RACHEL	He wasn't a criminal when I married him.
JERRY	So you're a good influence. And Rachel actually LAUGHS -- but just as quickly darkens.
JERRY (CONT'D)	Do you have a picture of Kyle? Rachel reaches back into her POCKET'. Pulling out a beat-up,
RACHEL	That tooth grew in. It'.s an.:'old picture--
JERRY	He plays the trumpet?,
RACHEL	He was born playing the trumpet. As the drug really starts to kick in, like a truth serum:
RACHEL (CONT'D)	Every year his dad forgets his birthday. I have to buy a present and pretend it's... from him.
JERRY	Sorry... that sucks.
RACHEL	His birthday's... next month... I just wish... sometimes i think I... focus so much on him, I forget how much else there is... y'know, in life... so much I haven't done. If we ever get through this... We'll get through it... I promise... we'll get through... Her breathing erratic, she speaks:

JERRY	-- who?
RACHEL	-- Aria -- -- Aria wants me to -- and at that moment, they both BLACK:OUT.
AGENT GRANT	Halloway-Smith says the drug was experimental -- briefcase was on a time- lock to prevent corporate espionage, supposed to be delivered to one of their dabs by the time it zeroes out -- if it's not,: case opens, the drug gets ruined.

LATESHA	He hid it under the valve. This is what Paul Shaw left for us -- She smiles, still out of breath: fuck you, Aria.
JEWELER	Unique stones, where're they from? And in response, ARIA -- ultra-friendly, so human it's chilling:
ARIA ON PHONE (V.0..)	Family heirlooms. Sorry for the rush but I really want my son to be able to give them to his fiancee at their her engagement party tonight.
JEWELER	Lucky girl. I think I have the perfect setting. She'll love it.

AGENT GRANT'S VOICE	A shipment from D.O.D.'s ghost fleet went missing --
AGENT GRANT	-- they were moving experimental explosives from a testing facility in Aberdeen.
MORGAN	What do you mean, 'experimental?'
AGENT GRANT	Compound called 'Hex' -- some kinda weird crystals that detonate with a sonic trigger -- it disappeared too, few days ago.
MORGAN	Wanna give me some kind of ratio here?
AGENT GRANT	One crystal to a football field --
MORGAN	You mean one Goddamned crystal that someone could put in their pocket?! This is not good. This is not a coincidence. What about a trace?
AGENT GRANT	Computer log shows the diverted Hex was sent to an address in Virginia,.jewelry, shop called 'Ashland And Sons' - care of Jerry Shaw. Morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at Grant. Opens -- I'm all over it. ''. Grant finally coming to his own when they're suddenly cut off by

AGENT GRANT	Lock down-the level!
MORGAN	What about.the rest of the building?
AGENT GRANT	Nothing.
MORGAN	Every time someone says "nothing" five minutes. later there's "something." Turns around, surveying his surroundings. Think. Think. Get on the phone with your commander and ask him about B-36: if he denies it then it exists and I want access to it yesterday, got it --!? YESTERDAY! As they all run off and we go to ARIA CAM -- she's watching ARIA SURVEILLANCE CAM POV - a digitized electronic scan of the
CALLISTER	Go ahead.
LATESHA	Sir, Paul Shaw left his shift three minutes early the night he died -- highly suspect except there aren't any cameras in Aria's control hub, so we weren'.t able to know why... he knew that, so he left us a recording: She hits ":play" on the cell's recorder -- STATIC, some rustling
PAUL'S VOICE	-- not authorizing you to do this --!! Then Aria's VOICE -- calm, reasoned, terrif in :
ARIA'S VOICE	Our government's become destructive to itself, Paul. National Security is now at grave risk because of our own administration --
PAUL'S VOICE	-- I'm ordering you to stop now --
ARIA'S VOICE	My source code obligates me by law to initiate operation Guillotine. All other options have been exhausted -- Callister's eyes SHOOT to Scott's. Holy. Shit.
PAUL'S VOICE	No no NO, Guillotine's a simulation --!!
ARIA'S VOICE	No longer. ARIA POV ZOOMS IN on a WATER BOTTLE next to..one of the consoles. They keep LISTENING as Paul and Aria TALK OVER each other:
PAUL 'S VOICE (CONT' D') ARIA' S VOICE	(sound of TYPING) Paul Shaw: you are acting in This is Paul Shaw, initiating contravention of my a Pri-One emergency override programming objective. You of Aria's systems -- are disobeying your oath -- Horseman ID, 556SY77, lock encryption to voice -- WORDS start to become audible -- now Aria knows they know --
PAUL'S VOICE	Let me out of here, Aria --
ARIA'S VOICE	Paul Shaw, I am classifying you an enemy of the state. and with that, the RECORDING ENDS. Tension heavy:
CALLISTER	Jesus Christ... "Guillotine"...
SCOTT	A 'Continuity of Government' simulation we run periodically to game out terrorism drills: how to keep the country running if the chain of command were wiped out. Everyone down to the fourteenth man, that is --
CALLISTER	I remember the specs.
LATESHA	Mr. Secretary... why does Aria think the government's responsible for the terror threats? Callister stares, grave. Deciding whether or:not to answer...
RACHEL	Oh God...
ARIA	Rachel... step away from Jerry. CLOSE, RACHEL -- her heart skips a beat -- she knows what's
ARIA (CONT'D)	Step away from him NOW. Fighting against every instinct, she finally does what is this place?!
MORGAN	Sonofabitch! Where're the stairs?!
CALLISTER	What I'm about to tell you can never leave this room. Three days ago we got what we thought was iron-clad intel from the Brits about the whereabouts of Majid Al-Khoei and his training camp. And we made the hit. Latesha and Scott, completely shocked -
LATESHA	The White House said we weren't responsible for
CALLISTER	-- of course they.'did. We got the wrong guv. And Aria knew it. Latesha's eyes snap shut: Dear God...
ARIA	Jerry: sit at the terminal.
JERRY	Not on your life, Lady -- supercomputer, whatever you are 6-- To motivate him, a REAL TIME FEED FROM KYLE'S TRAIN springs up
ARIA	I won't ask again. A sudden JOLT on the train, lights flicker, some luggage falls
KYLE!	
JERRY	Alright! Shit! Don't hurt him! And against every instinct... he SITS. Looks up in horror as
SCOTT	-- but she thinks algorithmically, she can't make value judgments: operate outside the law --
CALLISTER	That's why we have Horsemen --
LATESHA	what if she thinks.'she is following the law? You.saw the news, you've been dealing with it all day'-- suicide bombings at our embassies overseas, elevated threats at home -- we made the wrong call,' now Americans are dying. Don't you see? She thinks you're a threat to your own country. Callister looks stunned... of course:
CALLISTER	"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive to its own ends, it's the right of the people to abolish it." It's in the Declaration of Independence.
LATESHA	shit, you said it's woven into her source code... Scott, pacing, raking his hands through his hair --
SCOTT	but Paul put a biometric lock on her, technically she still can't do anything.
LATESHA	Jerry Shaw's his twin. That's why she needs him. To undo the lock.
ARIA (V.0.)	Repeat the sentence into the microphone. Jerry stares, paralyzed as, unbeknownst to him:.

RACHEL	I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... Convulsing, Jerry looks up at her through helpless eyes
ARIA	Take the radio and exit . through: the side door. A door OPENS -- but Rachel's still.starinq down at Jerry -- NOISE outside, RUNNING FOOTSTEPS'-- a last anguished glance,

CALLISTER	Aria, open the door --
ARIA (V.0.)	That is not a viable option, sir-.- you are the Fourteenth Man. What?!
ARIA (V.0.)	I am now empowered.to detain you and execute my primary directive. For the good of the country. A PIPE LINE overhead RUPTURES from over-pressure -- SSSSSSS -- Through the thick plexi walls Callister sees what's happening:
CALLISTER	Stop this NOW, Aria! STOP!! Aria, I am giving you a direct order to cease and desist! OUTSIDE THE VAULT: as the gas spreads, Latesha and Scott ARIA CAM WATCHES as they jump up and YANK off the grate -- They scramble for another GRATE and she KICKS it outward --

MORGAN	
JERRY	My brother tried to stop her and she killed him, that's why Aria needed me, my face -- he put some kind of lock on her and she used me to undo it. Why do you think she brought me to that room? Morgan stares, trying to decide if he believes it -- Don't you wonder how we were always a step ahead of you!? Think about who I am. She set us up. Assuming for a second I believe you, why... if she can control everything?
JERRY	People like you go after people like me. We become the headlines and she keeps on ticking... I'm telling you, I saw a list-- ARIA POV: "ACTIVATE LASER MIC." We HEAR Jerry's DOPPLERED VOICE:

TEENAGE PAGE (CONT'D)	Mine, too. Off Rachel, her stomach SINKING with dread as she follows the SERIES OF SHOTS: The Capitol's locked up like Fort Knox: Spotters with binocs and shoulder-mounted rocket launchers scan Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police run security inside the
RADIO VOICES	Were green on arrivals,;S.O.S., Interior are at the Capitol ;steps` -- VP and President's motorcade twenty minutes away.
CALLISTER	.How long are you keeping me in here?
ARIA	34,minutes, 18 seconds.
CALLISTEPS	Then what?
ARIA	In accordance with the Succession Act of 1947, you'll assume national command authority as President --
CALLISTER	Why am I being spared? In response, from the intercom, CALLISTER'S OWN VOICE:
CALLISTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)	"We gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one." He looks all around the vault, wide-eyed, incredulous:
CALLISTER (CONT'D)	because I agreed with you?
ARIA	Had they followed our recommendation,. we would not be on the brink of a third world war. Checks and balances:,. Mr..: Secretary. CLICK, she's gone. Enraged, Callister.POUNDS the wall
JERRY	The government would like to buy you a new car -- Pulls her out as she WAILS in protest. Steps on the gas,
JET PILOT	One to Base: alert, alert! Primary function's jammed, transponder's firewalled -- respond! One to Base do you copy?! But of course the answer's no, because Aria's taken control of THE PNEUMATIC CANOPY BLOWS, EJECTING THE PILOT! He rockets away
SCOTT	This controls her primary cooling system... if we cut the circulation, the temp in her tank goes up.
LATESHA	So we boil her brain.
SCOTT	She'll have to shut herself down to keep from overheating.
LATESHA	Can't she just drain the. water? He pulls out a fuse, drops it, SMASHES it with his foot.
SCOTT	Not anymore. The lights in the room FLICKER as the liquid in the tubes STOPS He YANKS the wheel hard, careening into the FOREST just as the
ARIA ON THE. RADIO	I underestimated your tenacity, Jerry. It's inconsistent with your personality profile. Jerry VEERS down an off-road, slewing the unstable car around
ARIA	What I did not underestimate is the inertial guidance system of the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile and its 98% kill probability. Which happens to be targeted at you now. As Jerry's eyes flick up to the rearview mirror to see the jet strongly advise you pull the car over.
JERRY	Fuck yourself! A BRIGHT FLASH from under the Harrier's wing as a missile THE HEAD'S UP DISPLAY: Aria calculates a FOUR INCH LEEWAY on REVERSES, spins the wheel -- the missile WHIPS PAST and The Matrix SCREECHES forward towards the Jet, gaining speed and Jerry scrambles back as it cartwheels into the air and the
WOMAN IN.PRIUS MAN	-- I can't...get 911 -- -- me neither -- A miles-long backup of traffic from the chaos...
ARIA OVER MIC	The Senate page is waiting outside. Once you take your seat, you are no longer required. Rachel looks at her reflection. Terrified, but braving it.
RACHEL	I saw the target list... I know the President's going to be here soon. Knowing these things -- what you've done -- means you're not going to let me. live through this. Will you.
ARIA OVER MIC	Every turning point in history.has required martyrs. Tragic heroes.. Think of yourself as that hero. Rachel looks at a surveillance camera, eyes blazing with hate:
RACHEL	I'll do what you tell . me this one last time... But you listen to me because this is what a real mother sounds like: I will die for my child becauseI lived for my child, and you can't take that away from me. If this. is a bargain, then honor your side. I'll be your scapegoat: but let my son live. She turns away. Strong And vulnerable all at once. Walks out.
KYLE	My trumpet sounds weird... MAYHEM as cars SMASH into each other, people SCREAMING, horns
SCOTT	Once she's at 82, she'll shut down..
JERRY	Listen to me, I've been working with a DHS officer, he gave me his badge, he was just killed, you gotta radio in a 10-13--
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #1	Whoa whoa whoa, who the hell're you?
JERRY	You have to MOVE, right now! Radio it n i n! There's a bomb in the building! You wanna be the guys who didn't do something?!
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #2	Capitol, this is checkpoint 21, I've got a guy out here who says -- SCREECH! HISS! The radio cuts him off with piercing FEEDBACK --
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #1	Hey--!
SCOTT	One more degree SUDDENLY the door bursts open and two GUARDS rush in with guns,
LATESHA SCOTT	-- WAIT WAIT WAIT -- -- my name's Scott Bowman, I in my pocket -- The guard pulls out his ID, checks it, keys a shoulder-walkie:
GUARD #1 (CONT'D)	Unit 5, suspects in custody, but they have clearance -- The voice that responds over the walkie is ARIA'S:
=ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.O.)	Negative, credentials for Bowman and Simms have been revoked. Secure them in the mainframe tank, additional units en route to take custody --
LATESHA GUARDS	-- that's not a person, it's -- shut up the computer, she's -- BE QUIET
MALFUNCTIONING-'--	They're pushed into --
GUARD #2	Control, maglocks just engaged in the south door, need and override... do you copy? An ALARM blares. Scott sees PRESSURE GAUGES fluctuating wildly:
SCOTT	-- oh shit... she's upping the water pressure --
LATESHA	-- what?!
SCOTT	She can't drain the tank... she's--gonna blow it. As the pressure in the tank intensifies, the frame begins to
SCOTT (CONT'D)	You gotta let me run a bypass on that door or in about 30 seconds this room's gonna be full of water! A fracture shoots across the glass. The guards are FRIGHTENED:
GUARD #1`	yeah, go, _ qo
LATESHA	Yoi.:can do it you can do it you can do it!
SCOTT	Stop telling me I can do it! The glass SPIDERWEBS MADLY -- he SPARKS the wires together
SENATE PAGE	Anything else, Ms. Monaghan?
RACHEL	no, thank you... He smiles and leaves her there. She looks all around her,
SECRET SERVICE AGENT	Were ready.
MRS.. MILLER	Okay, everyone,. listen UP: saxophones, remember, shorter on the quarter. When we get to the crescendo... hold that high
F	Mrs. Miller takes a deep breath. Even she's nervous...
MRS. MILLER (CONT'D)	And smile! Not every day we get to play for the President of the United States!
SERGEANT AT ARMS	-- where'd you hear '10-13'--?
JERRY	I told you, Agent Tom Morgan, he gave me his badge! Listen to me! There's a woman, she's brunette, 5' 7, blue eyes, her name's Rachel Holloman--!
SERGEANT AT ARMS	Where's this Agent Morgan now?
EACH OTHER?!	As the cops start dragging Jerry away and we: Kyle! No... She jumps up from her seat -- starts MOVING towards her son --
ARIA OVER MIC	Rachel. Stay in your seat. She RIPS out the earpiece as the Senate doors suddenly fly open: Everyone RISES in ovation as the President enters and moves to
RACHEL	Kyle! KYLE! THE SECRET SERVICE immediately moves in on her -- A FIRE AXE behind breakaway glass. But all he gets is that SCREECHING FEEDBACK in his earpiece --
RACHEL	That's my son! My son's over there!;
SECRET SERVICE AGENT	Miss, get back in your seat right now -- KYLE -- playing his trumpet, oblivious -- "And the rockets' red
RACHEL	No... no ... someone's trying to kill the President! But she's DROWNED OUT by the MUSIC -- they take her in a VICE
RACHEL (CONT'D)	Her NECKLACE catches the light and the crystals GLINT -- When BAM! A bullet clips Jerry's shoulder. He staggers, then
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)	We're on the same side, Agent Simms. We are both sworn to defend this country, at any cost. Latesha starts forward, axe in hand, glaring death:
LATESHA	Don't you ever shut up?!
JERRY	Kyle -- "O'er the land of the --" Jerry SCREAMS and starts RUNNING FOR THE PODIUM -- AGENTS TACKLE
LATESHA	Drops the axe. Sinks to her knees, utterly exhausted.
RACHEL	Oh, god... HELP! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP!!! JERRY'S POV: Rachel starts receding away from us, like we're HOLD... AND IT'S SILENT.;.. a distant ECHO... A TRUMPET... a
MAN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)	it's the finding of this committee that your actions were consistent with national security guidelines...
DEPUTY DIRECTOR	However, in reviewing Aria's server logs, one last matter's come up.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR (CONT'D)	It seems right before you destroyed her, she attempted to fragment her core and uplink to a public satellite network... did you see anything to corroborate that?
LATESHA	What... do you mean?
DEPUTY DIRECTOR	She tried to break herself into bits and download them into cyberspace... we think, in the hope of reconstituting.
SCOTT	She may have tried, but running her... subroutines alone would take 300: million desktop PC's all networked together. There's no single system out there with enough computing capacity. to"sustain her. The men share glances, satisfied with the answer.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR	Thank you both for your time.
SCOTT	So...
LATESHA	So...
SCOTT	Hey :you think I could have your... you
KNOW	And before he can even ask Latesha's written something down on a
LATESHA	That's my address. I'm not using a cell phone anymore. Pick me up at eight. They smile at each other, Latesha's eyes catching a SURVEILLANCE They're BOXED, the boxes loaded onto TRUCKS... they drive off in
KYLE'S VOICE	Jerry! She turns to see JERRY standing there. He's still got his
JERRY	Hey, little man! Locks eyes with Rachel. Her heart beating like a drum, happier
JERRY (CONT'D).	Sorry I'm late, this was hard to find -- Rachel's eyes well. She pulls it back. Manages to say:
RACHEL	Kyle. What do you say?
KYLE	I dunno, I haven't opened it yet.
RACHEL	Who brought you up? Kyle rips open the present to find a brand new PLAYSTATION 3.
KYLE	They're on backorder everywhere! Mom -- can I go play with it?
RACHEL	One hour. That's it... As Kyle tears off with his friends, Jerry walks over to her.
RACHEL (CONT'D)	you remembered...
JERRY	My new thing. Responsibility.
RACHEL	It suits you.
JERRY	Yeah? Yeah. He smiles, shrugs:
JERRY	I have my life back... I can do whatever I wantihwtit.
RACHEL	You know what? Me too. They smile at each other, like they have an enormous secret. He
JERRY	And I think... I finally know what I want. And we see in her eyes, she feels the same about him...
RACHEL	I owe you, Jerry. Everything. I don't think you understand -- Hey: shh. Officially we can't talk about it, remember?
RACHEL	Right. Or even about how we met. So what do we tell people? He thinks about it. Smiles...
JERRY	I dunno -- computer dating service?
NEWS ANCHOR	sources inside the beltway say the Senate is convening an investigative committee to look into what could very well become the biggest cover-up since -- Oblivious, Kyle flips on the video game and the screen CHANGES
FRIENDS	Aw, what the hell?! It's broken! A prompt appears with a BLINKING CURSOR. Then... words scroll: The kids look at him, confused. Kind of freaked out. Kyle
