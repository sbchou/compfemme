VERONA (CONT'D)	Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ... if you're watching this tape it means that I somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal ... opting instead to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you heard me... ... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep. How sick is that?... for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there's nothing you can do about it... 5A 5A ... that's right, you're on candid camera, try not to embarrass yourself... shit out, right? Right? Don't bother... the shit I gave you is some fucking high tech sci-fi Chinese synthetic shit that even I don't know exactly what the fuck it is. All I know is once it binds with your blood cells, you're fucked, baby... and believe me, it's done binded. By now you'll be feeling your joints stiffen up... hard to breath... heart.

HOCOLATE	I'm sorry, the doctor isn't in the office at this time, may I take -
CHEV	Where is he?
CHOCOLATE	I beg your pardon sir?
CHEV	Where - thefuck - is - he?
CHOCOLATE	I don't know sir, this is his answering service, would you like me to have him paged? CONTINUED:

CHOCOLATE	Yes sir...
CHEV	Thank you.
KAYLO (O.S.)	Hello?
CHEV	Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night? KAYLO is late 20's, slightly plump, hispanic, with gelled AYLO h, what's up Chev? I said, where were you last night? PUTTING ON LIPSTICK, FAKE TITS, THE WORKS, VOGUEING AT SOME I ... uhh ...
HEV	Yeah, yeah. You wanna know what I was doing?
KAYLO	What?
CHEV	GETTING KILLED, YOU IDIOT!
KAYLO	What?
HEV	What? What? You heard me. That son of a bitch Ricky Verona.
AYLO	Ricky Verona ...
CHEV	Who would've thought that little bastard had the stones to come whack me in my own crib... it's inconceivable... and yet, here we are.
KAYLO	Where are we? CONTINUED:
CHEV	I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen: you put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call me.
CHEV (CONT'D)	I'm going to get that little son of a bitch if it's the last thing I do... it may actually be the last thing I do, understand that? Copy me on that?
KAYLO	Ricky Verona?
CHEV	Find him! The continuous ROLLER DOLLY move takes us inside and KEEPS CONTINUED:
CHEV	Where's Verona!!
ORLANDO	It's cool it's cool it's cool!
CHEV	Talk!!
ORLANDO	I'm talking! What are we talking about?
CHEV	Don't fuck with me!!
ORLANDO	OK, nobody's fucking with you, just calm down ...
CHEV	DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER!
BIKER (O.S.)	O-land-o! What's up!
ORLANDO	There's a white man with a gun in here, I would prefer that he not cap my ass, so please refrain from any sudden ass bullshit! Now you see that? I'm trying to help you here.
CHEV	Look, I got to find Ricky Verona ...
ORLANDO	Why would I know where ... ?
CHEV	... right, I know, you don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS INTO THAT TOILET!!
ORLANDO	THE WHITE MAN IS COOL! THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!
S	ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping.
ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Can we all just get along? Can we?
ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Now Chevy here has something he would like to discuss. So we are going to discuss it. In a civilized manner. Chevy? I believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make?
CHEV	Where's Verona.
ORLANDO	OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky Verona.
CHEV	You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me ...
ORLANDO	Easy ... easy ... now things are beginning to clarify ... you see how that works? How discussion can lead to clarity?
ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Clearly you are operating under a false pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did not "pull the Anselmo job together." In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars.
CHEV	That's not how I heard it.
ORLANDO	But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. So you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down. S tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying
CHEV	Alright. away, crazy bitch ass mother ...
ORLANDO	Thank you. That's what I'm talking about. That resembles civility.
ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Shit dude, what's the matter with you?
CHEV	Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch ...
ORLANDO	I understand that. You've made that point abundantly clear to all of us. Now what can I do to help you?
CHEV	Look, just give me some coke, OK? You got any coke?
ORLANDO	OK, now you're insulting me.
CHEV	Come on, man, I know you got coke.
ORLANDO	You think every brother is carrying, is that it?
CHEV	Come on, I don't have time for this, just give me something ... I'm really dying here ...
ORLANDO	I can see that.
CHEV	No. You don't understand, I'm really fucking dying ... if I don't ... May I just have some coke, please?
ORLANDO	So this is medicinal use coke, that's what you're telling me.
CHEV	That's right. Well?
CHEV	W hat?
ORLANDO	You got something for me, or what?
ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Chevy ... come on, man...
CHEV	OK, that's good. That's good.
RLANDO	Oh that's good, right?
ORLANDO (CONT'D)	W hy you looking for Verona anyway?
CHEV	Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me...
ORLANDO	Ah, so this is about the Don Kim situation. What do you know about it?
ORLANDO	I know you pulled the trigger.
CHEV	Of course I pulled the trigger! WHY WOULDN'T I PULL THE TRIGGER?!
ORLANDO	O...kay...
ORLANDO (CONT'D)	Whoa, Chelios. You good, man?
CHEV	his shit's not working.
ORLANDO	Beg your pardon?
HEV	I think I know what I have to do.
ORLANDO	Well, a man's got to do what a man's got to do. Uhh... what exactly is it that you got to do?
HEV	Got to kick... some black... ass.
ORLANDO	What? O There he goes again.
CHEV	Alright ... who wants white meat? A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it, HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE JACKHAMMER. Speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating
CHEV	Doc? IN A SPLIT SCREEN WE SEE IT'S VERONA. VERONA ey, what's up, Doc!
CHEV	You motherfucker!
VERONA	ude, aren't you dead yet? What the hell are you doing out there?
CHEV	I'm coming for you, asshole, believe me.
VERONA	eah, whatever. Look, just thought you'd like to know that I'm all about hooking up with that mystery girl you've been banging as soon as your ass is underground ... I forgot to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left for you...
CHEV	Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history.
CHEV (CONT'D)	Great. more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up

DOC MILES	The flow of adrenaline is keeping you alive.
CHEV	I'm having a little trouble hearing you, Doc.
DOC MILES	Listen, Chev - you have to keep moving.
CHEV	Explain.
DOC MILES	If I'm right, they gave you the Beijing Cocktail... very nasty ... works on your adrenal gland, blocking your receptors. The only way to slow it down is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant. e hops out with cell phone to his ear and takes a ride to

CARLITO	Word travels fast. You amaze me, my friend.
CHEV	What can I say. Look, Carlito, I need your help. I don't have much time.
ARLITO	No, not much.
CHEV	We've got to find an antidote or something. What's the matter?
CARLITO	The shit they gave you ... it's the Chinese shit. There is no antidote. I wish there was something I could do.

CARLITO	Verona? That's just a small time punk. But... that's not to say there isn't an opportunity here.
CHEV	Opportunity.
CARLITO	Everyone knows the love I have for you, Chev. Maybe this can even the score for the Don Kim hit, which was perhaps ill- advised.
CHEV	Ill advised?
CARLITO	The heat from Hong Kong has been more than we anticipated.
CHEV	Oh. That's outstanding, Carlito. I'm glad to know that my death can be of some use to you.
CARLITO	Don't be difficult.

DOC MILES Your only shot is to massively increase the level of ephedrine in your body ... to force out the inhibitors ... 6B 36B CHEV In English, doc. Please.

CHEV (CONT'D)	Whoa whoa whoa... he building opens out back into a small parking area. Trash sight of the HOOD.
HEV	Aww, damn it, I'm sorry baby...
EVE	Nice one.
VE (CONT'D)	I swear to God, Chev, I don't know what you're on these days but it is not working for you... A PARAKEET in a cage by the window disappears in a puff of
EVE	You know, I could use a little help here.
CHEV	Is this yours?
EVE	Where's your car? CONTINUED:
CHEV	My car. Actually... I took a cab. A POLICE MOTORCYCLE is tipped over on a lawn, coughing up MONTAGE: Chinatown is bustling with activity. Vendors haggle together in a swelling din of live things.
E	and jogger.
VE	You're embarrassing.
CHEV	You know, I didn't have a lot of time to pick this out ...
EVE	Hm. So why are we here? CHEV sits across from EVE in a tiny restaurant. An equally
CHEV	"This isn't going to be easy" ... as they say ... Alright, here it is. I told you I was a video game programmer. That was a lie. Actually...
CHEV (V.O.)	I kill people. I'm a professional hitman. I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate.
CHEV (V.O.)	Last night was a job like a hundred others. A high dollar hit. Nothing special.
HEV (V.O.) (CONT'D)	And then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range... S ilence hangs heavy in the room... CHEV holds the gun to DON
DON KIM	Well? What are you waiting for? CONTINUED:
HEV	Congratulations.
DON KIM	Did I win something?
CHEV	Your life, jackass. A hundred grand wants you dead, so sooner or later it's going to happen. But I'm not doing it.
DON KIM	I see.
CHEV	nstead, you're going to do something for me. You're going to get out of town. Disappear. I don't care where you go, I don't care what you do, so long as you're invisible for 48 hours. That's all I ask.
DON KIM	48 hours.
CHEV	Or if you prefer, we can do it the other way, the way where I go to work and you go meet Buddah.
CHEV	See: I quit. I quit the business. For you.
EVE	For me?
CHEV	figure I call you that night. I tell you everything. You understand. We get on a plane together and leave all this shit behind. Never come back. Pretty crazy, huh?
VE	You are so weird. Are we going on a trip?
CHEV	Yeah, well... I may be going on a trip, but you're not coming with me...
EVE	I don't understand. EVE storms out of the restaurant, letting the door slam
CHEV	Eve... baby... please!
EVE	Mob hits, Chev? Chinese poison? Do you know how ridiculous you sound? If you're going to break up with me, at least you can tell me the truth.
CHEV	You think it sounds crazy? How do you think I feel - I've gotta live this shit...
VE	Oh my God, Chev... what's the matter with you? CONTINUED: He looks around like a drowning man. People everywhere, but
CHEV	... just need...
EVE	Chev, you're scaring me.
CHEV	Wait a minute. Do you trust me?
EVE	No.
CHEV	Make love to me.
EVE	What?
CHEV	Come on. I think it'll help.
EVE	Help what?
EVE (CONT'D)	Get off! Are you kidding me?
CHEV	Take your clothes off.
EVE	No!
CHEV	You always say you want to be more spontaneous. E VE You're insane. You're like some adrenaline junkie with no soul.
CHEV	Save me, Eve. Save my life.
EVE	Stop it!
EVE (CONT'D)	Oh my God, Chev!
She reaches instinctively to comfort him and he lunges	
EVE (CONT'D)	You filthy animal ...
EVE (CONT'D)	Take me right here in front of everyone.
E	That's it... do it ...
VE (CONT'D)	Come on, put it in me...
EVE (CONT'D)	What are you waiting for? Tell me you're joking. Now you can't get it up?

CHEV	Right... just step on it, alright? CONTINUED:
HAITIAN CABBIE	Hey, you not gonna die in my cab, crackhead.
HAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D)	I got something for you.
HAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D)	You drink this Haitian shit, crackhead. This right here is some hardcore shit. Made from plant shit.
CHEV	Nice.
HAITIAN CABBIE	What are you laughing at? Look at this!
AITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D)	You see that? That's what a man looks like, crackhead. That's the power. Now look at you.

HOOD #2	The Chinese... are you crazy?
CHEV	Yeah I am. Where's Kaylo?
HOOD #2	Chevy ... I'm sorry, man ... I didn't ...

HEV	ike this? WHERE'S VERONA?
HOOD #1	Verona got nothing to do with this.
CHEV	What? CONTINUED: Don Carlos wants you off the street.
CHEV	Carlito?
HOOD #1	You've totally lost your shit, dude ... you're all over the TV ... destroying property, making unauthorized hits ... you're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment.
CHEV	Carlito ordered this?
HOOD #1	Look, forget about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die.
CHEV	Just die.
HOOD #1	Yeah. Just ... die.
CHEV	Maybe you're right.
HOOD #1	I mean we all gotta die sometime, right?

EVE	Darn it, I forgot to take my birth control pill.
CHEV	here's the keys? E VE holds out her hand, where she's had them all along.
CHEV (CONT'D)	Cool.
EVE	My stuff...
EVE	You weren't lying.
CHEV	Welcome to my life.
EVE	No, I mean: that you were going to give it all up for me.
CHEV	Oh. Yeah.
EVE	And the other part?
CHEV	The poison? Yeah, that's true too.
EVE	Then... that means...
CHEV	Pretty much.
EVE	How can we stop it?
CHEV	Adrenaline. It's the only thing that slows it down.
VE	So... when we were in Chinatown...?
CHEV	Yeah. Sorry. What are you doing?
EVE	his will get you going.
CHEV	WHAT?
EVE	Come on, let's finish what you started.
CHEV	Oh boy...
CHEV (CONT'D)	Oh yeah, that's... that's really working for me...

DOC MILES	Chevy! Holy shit, man, I've been trying to reach you for a half hour.
CHEV	Where are you? DOC is calling from the broken down apartment we saw earlier.
DOC MILES	I'm at my office. Can you get here? SIRENS approach outside. CHEV meets EVE'S eyes, shakes his

HEV	I owe you again, Doc.
DOC MILES	You're my best customer.
CHEV	What is this stuff?
DOC MILES	Synthetic ephedrine, diluted with saline.
CHEV	It feels sort of good.
DOC MILES	Oh, I also gave you a little meth. That's the endorphins rushing into to your brain that you're feeling.
CHEV	So I'm not... better?
DOC MILES	Fuck no. You're in such shit shape it's stunning. I've never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep ticking. You should be in a fucking medical journal or something.
CHEV	So... what are you going to do?
DOC MILES	The solution I'm giving you is acting as a competitive inhibitor... meaning it pushes the poison out of your receptors and replaces it with a chemical... it's a temporary fix...
CHEV	Then what?
DOC MILES	Look, if we put you on life support we could maybe string you out for a few days, but at some point you'd almost certainly lapse into a coma... and then...
CHEV	Does she know?
EVE	I hate television.
DOC MILES	f you want, I can load you up with something, you'll go out in a beautiful dream.
CHEV	A dream.
DOC MILES	Can I do that for you, Chev?
CHEV	No... no, that's not what I want.
DOC MILES	Then ... what? CONTINUED:

CHEV (CONT'D)	I want one hour. RICKY VERONA and his CREW are in the back, watching a noisy
VERONA	Give me a fucking break... And so the wild rampage that began at 9 AM this morning in West Los Angeles continues, with the mysterious suspect still at large.
HOOD	Maybe we shoulda give him more of that Chinese shit. CONTINUED:
VERONA	Oh ... you think? Jesus ...
VERONA (CONT'D)	It's him. Alright, shut up.
VERONA (CONT'D)	What's up, corpse.
CHEV	Hey douchebag, thought you might be interested in a little deal.
ERONA	A deal? You're mental, dude.
CHEV	I want the antidote.
VERONA	Oh, the antidote, huh?
CHEV	That's right.
VERONA	And what are you prepared to give me. Asshole.
CHEV	How about the jewelry I got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker?
VERONA	Hmmm.
CHEV	Thinking about it?
VERONA	Alright.
CHEV	You like that deal?
VERONA	Whatever.
CHEV	I'll be at Downtown Standard in twenty minutes. You know the spot?
VERONA	Of course.
CHEV	Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing to some whore for a hand job ...
VERONA	I'll be there.
VERONA (CONT'D)	What the hell are you looking at?
V	Verona. You're not going to believe the call I just got. MONTAGE TO MUSIC: more of L.A. at 3 f.p.s. - the traffic
CHEV (O.C.)	It's going to be alright, baby. From a distance, in a locked off TELEPHOTO frame, we see CHEV
EVE (O.C.)	But... you said... I know. But things have changed. There's an antidote. I can make a deal for it, but I've got to go alone.
VE (O.C.)	I'm scared.
CHEV (O.C.)	Of course. But you'll be safe now. And I'll be back.
EVE	Do you promise?
CHEV	I promise. CHEV bangs through the revolving glass doors to the hotel. CONTINUED: The shot continues as CHEV moves through the LOBBY and makes The bathroom is empty.

CHEV	What's happening, brother? CONTINUED:
KAREN CHELIOS	Where did I go wrong?
CHEV	Did you say something?
KAREN CHELIOS	Like talking to the wall... C HEV Mom?
KAREN CHELIOS	I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.
KAREN CHELIOS (CONT'D)	You never call, you never write... I haven't seen you since you ran out at
CHEV	Right, with you popping Valium like Tic Tacs and balling some new asshole every two weeks... why wouldn't I stick around for entertainment like that?
KAREN CHELIOS	That's hurtful.
CHEV	Mom, I got no time for this...
ORLANDO	You got no time, period.
CHEV	Orlando?
RLANDO	ou a persistent motherfucker, Chev Chelios, I'll give you that.
CHEV	This is weird.
ORLANDO	But you know this has got to stop sometime. What do you think you are, Michael Myers? They pop you and you just keep gettin up?
CHEV	I'm the Terminator.
ALEX	You was that, maybe. But there's a new gun in town.
CHEV	Don't tell me you're talking about your bro, Def Lepard.
ALEX	He did you pretty good, didn't he?
CHEV	Yeah, not so much. I don't get it - why didn't you guys just cut me up alive when you had the chance?
ALEX	Verona said you was Chev Chelios - A.K.A. Death On Two Legs. He said you probably been a contract killer since grade school.
MIRROR CHEV	Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies. Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush. Cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like... like a GIFT... a warrior's death... hell, you'd probably get off on it...
HEV	Did you rehearse this?
MIRROR CHEV	No, this was the best way for a guy like you: a slow, ticking clock... winding down... inevitable... non-negotiable... until...
CHEV	Who the hell are you, anyway?
MIRROR CHEV	Don't you know?
CHEV	I think I'm starting to figure it out.
MIRROR CHEV	Yeah, well, better late than never. You know you're going to die up there.
CHEV	Yeah, maybe.
CHEV (CONT'D)	But I'm taking you with me. C HEV glances at the lit floor number display, then back.
CHEV (CONT'D)	Some pills, Doc. Easy ...
GOON	This way. The GOONS lead CHEV through a posh dining area, down a dark CARLITO and RICKY VERONA sit side by side at the table. An

CARLITO	Let me see that.
CARLITO (CONT'D)	Clever ... what is this, an insulin pump?
CHEV	Basically.
VERONA	What the fuck is insulin?
CARLITO	Ephedrine, right?
CARLITO (CONT'D)	Very resourceful ...
HEV	Found a new master, you little bitch, is that it?
VERONA	I'm nobody's little bitch.
CHEV	We'll see what kind of a bitch you are when Carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me... and you take it.
CARLITO	That's enough.
CHEV	You'll probably throw boss a nice little reach-around just to show what a good bitch you are.
VERONA	I'm nobody's little bitch, you hear me? He'll pay what I tell him to pay...!
CARLITO	I said that's enough. It's been a long day. But in the end, you must agree, it all works out quite nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you... ... and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall. Please understand, Chev, it's truly nothing personal.
VERONA	Speak for yourself.
CHEV	Is that what I think it is?
CARLITO	The Chinese shit. Hold him down.
CHEV	Not so fast, motherfucker.
VERONA	Dude's gone dipsy doodle...
VERONA (CONT'D)	Whatever, psycho...
CARLITO	I'm afraid the Houdini act is over, Chelios.

DON KIM	So this is how it is. V ERONA What... you... he...
