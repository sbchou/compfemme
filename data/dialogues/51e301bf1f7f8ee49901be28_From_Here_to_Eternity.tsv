CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
LONG SHOT	The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A SIX MONTHS BEFORE PEARL HARBOR
MEDIUM SHOT	A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs
MAGGID	Fine way to pass the time. Good for the mind.
PREW	Hello, Maggio.
MAGGIO	Prew...?
PREW	I transferred out of Fort Shatter.
Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes	
MAGGIO	You quit the Bugle Corps...? Prew nods. Maggio jerks his head toward the sign.
MAGGIO	To here...?
PREW	That's what the orders say.
MAGGIO	You made a bad mistake. This outfit they can give back to Custer.
MAGGIO	The Captain ain't in yet.
PREY	I'll look around.
MAGGIO	Maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night.
PHEW	Maybe.
TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET	
MEDIUM SHOT	The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT	The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew What're you think you're doing!? Why ain't you out in the field with the Compny? What's your name?
PREW	Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter.
WARDEN	Yeah. I heard about you.
PREW	I heard about you, too, Warden.
WARDEN	Well, put up that cue and come along. This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown. The Man's very particlar about little things like that.
TRUCKING SHOT	as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces
MEDIUM SHOT	as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room.
WARDEN	Mazzioli! Grant went to the hospital yesterday. Did you make up his sick record? Did you make a note for the morning report?! You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy Sickbook is your job!
MAZZIOLI	Those medics didn't get the Sickbook back till late yesterday -- I'll tend to it right now --
WARDEN	Thanks. I already done it for you.
ANOTHER ANGLE	Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now,
MAGGIO	But you the beat bugler they got over at Shatter. You probly the best on this whole Rock.
PREW	That's true.
MAGGIO	Well, friend, I feel for you. But from my position I can't quite reach you.
WARDEN	Ten-sh-HUT!
HOLMES	At ease. Good morning, men. Anything special this morning, Sergeant Warden? I've only a few minutes.
WARDEN	New man here, sir.
HOLMES	Oh, yes. Bring him in. Holmes goes into his office. Warden jerks his thumb toward
PREWITT	Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt reporting to the Compny Commander as ordered.
HOLMES	At ease. They sent your service record over... Twenty-two years of age... born in Kentucky... enlisted first at Fort Myer, Virginia... Bugle Corps... re-enlisted for overseas duty... Fort Shafter... First Bugler... Prewitt, I always make it a policy to talk to my new men. It's important for an officer and his men to understand each other. Now I have a fine smooth-running outfit.
ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN	Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with
HOLMES	Plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier. But he's got to show me he's got it on the ball. I don't know what you've been used to in the Bugle Corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book. What kind of trouble were you in over there?
PREW	No trouble, sir.
HOLMES	What made you transfer out, then?
PREW	It's a personal matter, air.
HOLMES	Oh. I see...
HOLMES	Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
WARDEN	Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had Corpral's stripes in the Bugle Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to buck Private to transfer to an Infantry Compny. Why? Because you like to hike?
PREW	I dint have no trouble if that's what you mean.
WARDED	Or was it just because you couldn't stand to bugle?
PREW	It was a personal matter.
WARDEN	That's up to the Compny Commander's discretion to decide.
PREW	All right. I was First Bugler at Shafter for two years. The topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states. Next day he made him First Bugler over me. And you asked out on account of that!?
PREY	Maybe I just ain't sensible... But that's the reason.
WARDEN	His feelings were hurt! Kids they send us now!
HOLMES	I've got a mighty sour Company Bugler here... but I suppose you wouldn't want that job.
PREY	No, air.
HOLMES	Well, we'll get your stripes back for you, maybe an extra one for good measure. You know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer?
PREW	No, sir.
HOLDS	I pulled a few strings. I'm the Regimental Boxing Coach, Prewitt. I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl year before last. With any luck you should have won it. I thought for a while, in the second round, you were going to knock him out.
PREW	Thank you, sir.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT HOLMES	My Regiment got beaten last year in the finals, as you know. But I mean to win this year. And I will. All I've needed was a top middleweight. Next year I'll hang your picture up there with the others, my boy.
PREW	I'm sorry, air. But I quit fighting.
HOLMES.	Quit fighting? When? What for?
PREW	I just stopped, sir... After -- Maybe you heard about what happened...
HOLMEB	You mean that fallow you hurt -- the one that went blind?
CLOSE SHOT PREW	Prew's lips are drawn tight. He nods almost imperceptibly.
MEDIUM SHOT	During this shot Maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to
HOLMES	Yes, it's too bad about that. I can understand how you feel. But those things happen in this game. A man has got to accept that possibility when he fights.
PREW	That's why I decided I would quit, sir.
HOLMES	But on the other hand, look at it this way. What if all fighters felt like that?
PREW	They don't.
HOLMES	Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt?
PREW	No, sir. I dint say --
HOLMES	You might as well say stop war because one man got killed. Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home.
PREW	I don't want it disbanded, sir. But I don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to.
HOLMES	It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is.
HOLMES	Maybe you'll change your mind. In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit. I've got to go into town. Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant?
WARDEN	Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's got to be made out. It's due TOMORROW --
HOLMES	You make it out. Is that all?
WARDEN	No, sir!
HOLMES	Well, whatever it is, you fix it. If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. I won't be back.
WARDEN	He'd strangle on his own spit if I weren't here to swab out his throat for him. Come on. I'll show you the Supply Room.
MEDIUM SHOT	as Prew and Warden enter and walk through. Maggio bobs his
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND PREW	as they come out of the Orderly Room. Prew hoists his
WARDEN	Know what you did just now? When you turned down Dynanite Holmes' boxing squad? You put your head in a noose. Things are soft for a boxer in his Compny. Otherwise, you better know how to soljer.
PHEW	I can soljer with any man.
WARDEN	This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this is straight duty.
PREW	I'll take my chances.
WARDEN	be the Royal Hawaiian?
PREW	Who's she?
WARDEN	His wife. Captain Holmes'.
WARDEN	You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight because Captain Holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make Mayor. And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. I only been in this outfit eight months myself but I learned one thing. My job is to keep him happy. The more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better I run his Compny. So we know where we stand, don't we, kid?
PREW	I know where I stand. I don't believe that's the only way a man can get along. A man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. It he don't, he's nothin...
WARDEN	Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. But not in our time, kid. Today you got to play ball. You got to divide it all by two.
MEDIUM SHOT SHOOTING INTO SUPPLY ROOM	
WARDEN	Lava! Can't I once walk by this Supply Room and find you workin with both hands!
LEVA	I can't do no better on what you people pay me.
WARDEN	Draw some supplies for this man. That's G Compny barracks over there. Get rid of your bags and come back here, and Leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in. Save you makin four five trips.
PREW	Okay.
WARDEN	I just hate to see energy wasted. Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin yours.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN AND LEVA	
LEVA	Her and them sweaters.
LONG SHOT KAREN FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S POV	
WARDEN'S VOICE	Army women... They're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond. There's no pleasure in them...
LEVA'S VOICE	Yeah, but this one knows the score... Like I been tellin you.
WARDEN'S VOICE	Is that right?
LEVA'S VOICE	Okay, not around here. But I was back at Fort Bliss with Holmes. When they was married only a year or two. I heard plenty about the lady then. Plenty.
WARDEN'S VOICE	You heard.
LEVA'S VOICE	Okay, never me. But a lot of them. I know some of the Use she played 'around with, don't tell me.
WARDEN'S VOICE	I ain't tellin you. You're tellin me.
KAREN	Good morning, Sergeant.
MEDIUM SHOT	
KAREN	I'm looking for my husband.
WARDEN	Captain Holmes just went in town, ma'am.
KAREN	Oh. Of course, He was to have left some things for me. That he was to have purchased. Do you know anything about them?
WARDEN	No, ma'am, I don't. Is there anythin I can do for you?
KAREN.	No, thanks, Sergeant.
KAREN	He's been telling me quite a bit about you lately. My husband. He says you're very efficient.
WARDEN	Yes, ma'am.
KAREN	What is it that makes you so efficient, Sergeant?
WARDEN	I couldn't help it if I was born smart, ma'am.
KAREN	I love that. Well, good-bye, Sergeant.
LEVA	But man, she sure is one, ain't she?
WARDEN	One what?
LEVA	One woman.
WARDEN	I've seen better.
HOLMES	I'm sorry I'm so late. And about dinner, I --
KAREN	It doesn't matter.
HOLMES	-- I got tied up with General Slater. Bumped into him at the Officers' Club.
KAREN	Yes? What did the General have to say?
HOLMES	Success, he said. Success in war, success in peacetime... And not a word about my promotion... There are times I think the Old Man's just waiting to ship me down... I've had a bad day all around... started right off this morning... trouble with a new man...
KAREN	If you'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with your Company, maybe you'd get that promotion.
HOLDS	The Company takes care of itself. Or my Topkick takes care of it.
KAREN	I went over there this morning looking for you.
HOLMES	I had some business to attend to in town. During the afternoon.
KAREN	From the way you look I gather your business wasn't too successful.
HOLMES	Now what does that mean?
KAREN	Dana. Give me credit for a few brains.
HOLMES	How many, times do I have to tell you I haven't any other women before you'll believe me?
HOLMES VOICE	If it were so, don't you think I'd admit it? The way things are between us now? What right have you to always be accusing me?
KAREN	What right?
TWO SHOT	They are both tense now. Holmes is out of the chair and
HOLMES	That again. How long will it be, I wonder, before I'm allowed to live that down? After eight years, how many times do I have to tell you It Was An Accident?
KAREN	That makes it all right, I suppose!
HOLMES	I didn't say that. I know what it's done to you, but --
KAREN	You know I hate to talk about it!
HOLM ES	How many times do I have to tell you I'm sorry, about that? How many times that I had no way of knowing -
KAREN	You had a way of knowing, Dana. I want to go to bed. Please get out of my bedroom.
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN	The room is fairly well filled with soldiers. The click of
FULL SHOT AT POOL TABLE	Maggio, Prew and CHIEF CHOATE, a Corporal, are playing pool.
CHOATE	I'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight.
MAGGIO	Man, what I would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my home town: I'd dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth, and I would make a whole mint of ghelt off him!
WILSON	We'd of won last year if we had a good middleweight. You box as good as you used to over at Shatter we're a cinch this year.
THORNHILL	You ain't forget the Division champs get ten day furloughs, did you, son? Ey?
GALOVITCH	You no talk now, Prewitt. But out in field with us you sing different song. An don't think you are tough guy. Quickest way to stockade is BEING TOUGH guy.
HENDERSON	You heard him. Better think it over. Lissen, it's his right not to fight if he don't want. Without bein kicked around. Now, we playin pool. Whyn't you take off?
DHOM	You want a busted head, Maggio?
MAGGIO	No.
DHOM	Then keep your big nose out altogether. Trainin season starts next week --
PREW	I told you I quit fightin! I'm through! An that's all she wrote: You guys want to put the screws on, go ahead. I can take anything you hand out!
DHOM	Okay, Prewitt. No halts barred.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN	His paper still on his lap. He has been watching. He wears a

MAGGIO	I just hate to see a good man get it in the gut.
CHOATE	You might as well get use to it, kid. You probly be seein it often before you die.
MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND CHOATE	In b.g. a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine
CHO ATE	... oh, sure, we got a few bad non- coms and we got Dynamite Holmes for a Captain. But I been around twenty years in this Army. They even up.
CHOATE	Take A Compny. They got the best Compny Commander I ever saw. But their Topkick -- he ain't no Warden.
WARDEN	Hello, kid. Everythin nice and comfy?
PREW	Never better.
WARDEN	'at's the lull before the storm, kid. Set yourself.
PREW	What's the deal with him, anyway? I can't figure him.
CHOATE	The Warden? He's a wild man. He was in the 15th when they seen their action in the Settlement in Shanghai. I heard about it down in the Philippes even. He got himself a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it but you'd never know it if I dint tell you. This next war comes, Warden'll be right in there, standin up on the skyline, trio to get himself killed, but nothing will ever touch him. He'll come through maddern, wildern, craziern ever. All I know is he's the best soljer I ever saw...

HOLMES	I won't be back in time to take Retreat. Or Reveille either, probably.
WARDEN	Yes, sir.
HOLMES	All work and no play, Sergeant. All you do is sit around sweating over this paper and that. There are other things in this world beside work.
HOLMES	You ought to get out more yourself, Warden.
WARDEN	I've been considering it.
HOLMES	Well, I'm going.
HOLMES	I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.
WARDEN	It'll be here when you get back.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN	standing on the open porch, in the rain. He wears a GI
KAREN	Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet.
MEDIUM SHOT	as Warden jumps in. He takes off his rain hat.
WARDEN	I am wet.
KAREN	If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here.
WARDEN	And if I'm not looking for him?
KAREN	He still isn't here. If that does you any good.
WARDEN	Well, I'm looking for him. Do you know where he is?
KAREN	I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town. I guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the Club. Having a drink.
WARDEN	I got some papers it's important for him to sign. Today.
KAREN	I'll try phoning him at the Club for you.
WARDEN	I never like to disturb a man drinking.
KAREN	What is it you want, Sergeant?
WARDEN	I could use a drink myself right now. Bad. Anyway, I got a faint suspicion the Captain's `in town.' Ain't you going to ask me in? Karen finally smiles, faintly. She goes into the kitchen,
MEDIUM SHOT	The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a
KAREN	You're taking an awful chance, you know. My maid is liable to be home any time.
WARDEN	No she won't. Thursday's her day off.
KAREN	You think of everything, don't you, Sergeant?
WARDEN	I try. In my position you have to.
KAREN	Are these really important?
WARDEN	Yes. But not important they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.
WARDEN	I got carbons of those back at the office. So it won't be much work to fix them up.
KAREN	That's what I like about you, Sergeant. You have confidence. It's also what I dislike about you.
WARDEN	It's not confidence. It's honesty.
KAREN	Honesty? How did you acquire such an old-fashioned virtue?
WARDEN	I figgered out one day it was the shortest distance between two points.
KAREN	Well, he's clever as well as virile.
WARDEN	No -- it's just that I hate to see a beautiful woman goin all to waste.
KAREN	Waste, did you say? Now that's a subject I might tell you something about. There's we. And then there's waste. Positive and negative. The negative is sometimes more interesting... more evil. For example -- what about the house without a child? Tell me your thoughts, Sergeant.
WARDEN	You're going to cry.
KAREN	Not if I can help it.
WARDEN	Please don't cry... I can't stand to see somebody cry. Karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat, is about
KAREN	What are you doing?
WARDEN	I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?
KAREN	I don't know, Sergeant. To be honest, I don't know.
WARDEN	I know a beach near Diamond Head. Nobody ever goes there. The cars on the highway pass above and they never know it's there. You feel like you used to feel when you were a kid, hiding by yourself in a cave, watching the others hunting you.
KAREN	Maybe... why not?
WARDEN	How about Payday?
KAREN	You don't have to spend money on me, Sergeant.
WARDEN	I just like to have some on me when I take out a woman. Can you get away?
KAREN	Maybe. Warden grins as he puts on his raincoat. He goes to the door
WARDEN	I'll be in Kuhio Park. Say, nine o'clock. Payday.
HOLMES	-- this man Prewitt's been here over a month now. I expected you mend have him around before this.
HENDERSON	We've been runnin him pretty hard. But he don't faze.
HOLMES	Maybe he needs a good dose of The Treatment.
GALOVITCH	A double dose needs him to be given.
THORNHILL	The Treatment'll bring that puppy boy around...
HOLMES	You understand. I don't want any rough stuff. But we all know good athletes make good leaders. And good leaders --

WARDEN	I didn't say you minded it, kid. I just said you looked tard. Drawn to a fine edge.
PREW	I don't mind it, Top. It's a great life, this. I find a pearl, I'll cut you in. Fifty-fifty, If you hadn't put me here, I wouldn't have had no chance to find it.
TWO SHOT WARDEN AND PREW	
WARDEN	Well, well, there's a man for you. I'll see if I can fix you up with a lot more since you like it so much. How you like the garbage detail?
PREW	Thanks, Top, I've had it. You give it to me Tuesday. Remember?
WARDEN	Well, then, how 'bout street cleaning detail?
PREW	That, too. Yesterday.
WARDEN	You got a better memory than me. Guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while, huh?
WARDEN	Course if you was an ath-a-leet you wouldn't have to pull KP. Or any fatigue duty for that matter...
PREW	If you think you can push me into fightin, Warden, you're wrong. Not you and Dynamite and The Treatment. I'm twice the man you are. If you dint have them stripes I'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp.
WARDEN	Don't let the stripes worry you, kid. I can always take my shirt off. Take it off right now.
PREW	You'd like that. You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one, couldn't you?

MAGGIO	There. You see. Any time women see a soldier, think he's drunk. Why? You know why?
PREW	Because he is.
MRS. KIPPER	Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix with the entertainment business. Every respectable place must consider its future.

LORENE	Oh. Somehow I didn't think you were a soldier.
PREW	Well, I am. And I'm in for the whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man.
LORENE	I suppose it's different when a fellow is going to make a career of it.
PREW	There ain't anythin wrong with a soljer that ain't wrong with everyone else.
LORENE	I like you just the same. I liked you the minute I saw Annette bringing you in.
PREW	Me, too. I mean when I came in. I saw you over here --
FATSO'S VOICE	I'll play loud as I want, ya little Wop!
PREW	Friend of mine. You wait right here for me, will ya?
LORENE	Surely.

MAGGIO	Shut up, you Wop, he says to me!
FATSO	Little Mussolini here tryin to tell me what way to play the piano.
MAGGIO	Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust already with that noise!
MRS. KIPFER	You man can simply leave if you're not going to behave yourselves.
PREW	Come on, Angelo, come on --
MAGGIO	-- Ony my friends can call me Wop --

SOLDIER	-- I'm tellin you, leave him be. Nets danger. I seen him nearly murder a guy once. He likes it. Sandra comes over, disengages Prew's arm from Maggio's, puts
SANDRA	All right, bully boy, now you won the war, let's dance.
MAGGIO	First I got to calm my nerves. Come on with me to a phone booth or some thin. Where I will unveil this fifth of whisky I got under this loose flowing sports shirt.

BILL	-- you go along as fast as forty miles per through that surf and your balance has got to be letter perfect.
PREW	Hey, I thought you were gonna wait.
LORENE	Bill here was telling me about surfboarding.
BILL	Hello, friend.
LORENE	Sit down and just listen. He describes it thrillingly.
BILL	You know anything about surfboarding?
PREW	No. Nothing. Not a thing.
BILL	You must be stationed inland then. I'm at DeRussey so I get lots of chances.
PREW	Yeah? But then we got mountains. You know anything about mountain climbing?
BILL	A little bit. Are you a mountain climber?
PREW	No. You know anything about flying an airplane?
BILL	I've had a few lessons.
PREW	Well, I can't fly either. What do you know about deep sea diving?
LORENE	Do you want to move into another room, Bill?
BILL	Sure. The air in here seems to have gotten very smelly, hasn't it?
PREW	Yeah, I noticed that, too --
BILL	Listen, fellow --

KAREN	Why, hello. I didn't think you were coming.
WARDEN	Why not? I'm not late.
KAREN	No, I guess you're not. But then I came a little early. I must have been overanxious. You weren't overanxious though, were you? You got here right on the dot.
WARDEN	Maybe I'd of been early too only I stopped to get a drink.
KAREN	You certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting. Would you rather it'd been the cocktail lounge of the Royal?
KAREN	No, but I've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes.
WARDEN	That's par for the course around here.
KAREN	Well, I don't care for it. I never went in much for back-alley loving.
WARDEN	Didn't you?
KAREN	You probably think I'm a tramp, don't you?
WARDEN	What makes you think I'd think that?
KAREN	Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant. If you think this is a mistake, come right out and say so.
WARDEN	Listen, what started all this, anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher! Where'd I come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander's wife! And her actin like Lady Astor's horse all because I only got here on time!
KAREN	On the other hand, I've got a bathing suit under my dress.
WARDEN	Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It parked around the corner.
MEDIUM SHOT COUCH	Fatso's piano music o.s. Prew is slumped on the couch. He
PREW	How's the surfboard rider?
LORENE	That was a terrible way to have acted. What you did.
PREW	I was jealous.
LORENE	You're a funny one.
PREW	What do you dames want? To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire?
LORENE	Now, look here, what do you think Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're hired to be nice to all the boys. They're all alike. Is it so important?
PREW	Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike. All right, I'm sorry about before.
LORENE	That piano is about to drive me out of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's suite and sit there. She lets us use it sometimes... for somebody special.
PREW	Are you mad?
LORENE	No, I'm not mad.
PREW	Because if you're still mad I'd just rather we called the whole thing off.
LORENE	You certainly are a funny one.

MEDIUM SHOT DIVAN	CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft
LORENE	... I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own. To get away from my home town. In Oregon.
PREW	How come?
LORENE	I had a boy friend. I was a waitress. He was from the richest family in town. He just married the girl suitable for his position. After three years of going around with me. It's a pretty story, isn't it? Maybe they could make a movie of it.
PREW	They did. Ten thousand of them.
ANOTHER ANGLE	Lorene smiles.
LORENE	So I left and went to Seattle, as a waitress. And I met a girl just back from Hawaii. She said she'd made a lot of money working for Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first boat. I've been here a year and two months.
PREW	You like it much?
LORENE	Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it. Anyway, I won't be here forever.
PREW	No. Sure not. I mean, why should you?
LORENE	I have it all figured out. In another year I'll be back home, with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer. And then I will be all set for life --
MEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL	as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its
MAGGIO	I dint hear no sounds of combat. So I figgered maybe you'd like a drink.
THREE SHOT	as Maggio comes into the room.
MAGGIO	Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself. She's a fine girl. But she drinks like a fish.
LORENE	No, thanks. I never drink much.
LORENE	I think it' a a weakness.
MAGGIO	I grant you that.
LORENE	And I don't like weakness. Do you?
PREW	No. I don't like weakness. But I like to drink.
LORENE	With you it's not a weakness. With you it's more like a virtue.
MAGGIO	That sounds like a very profound remark. Maybe that's why I don't get it.
LORENE	Well, it's so.
MAGGIO	Hey! What you gonna do, marry this guy? Way you grinnin at him you look like his wife!
PREW	Get outa here!
MAGGIO	Okay. Back to old long-legged Sandra. I love 'em tall. Acres and acres.
MAGGIO	Enjoy yourself, pizon. You need it more than me. You be back with The Treatment tomorrow.
PREW	That was nice before. The way you snuggled up. In front of him.
LORENE	What's he mean, The Treatment?
LORENE	What did he mean?
PREW	Some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because I won't fight.
LORENE	Fight?
PREW	On the boxing team. I don't want to fight! I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to think about it. And they make me think about it. Every day.
PREW	It's a personal thing...
PREW	Over at Port Shafter... I used to fight... Middleweight. I was pretty good. I used to work out with Dixie Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he was fast... And good. He loved boxing. He was gonna come out of the Army and go right into the upper brackets... People on the Outside had their eye on him. Dixie didn't want, to use the six ounce gloves this time. And we neither of us wore headgear, anyway. I was set flat on my feet when I caught Dixie wide with this no more than ordinary solid cross. Dixie just happened to be standing solid, too. From the way he fell I knew. Dead weight, square on his face. He dint roll over. He was in a coma a week. Then he finally came out of it. The only thing was that he was blind... I went up to the hospital to see him. Twice. Then I couldn't go back. We got to talking about fighting the second time. And Dixie cried... Seein tears comin out of those eyes that couldn't see...
MEDIUM SHOT NEAR SHORE	A wave sweeps by camera, Karen and Warden riding it into
CLOSEUP	as they kiss. The embrace is impassioned. When their lips
EXTREME CLOSEUP	as Karen and Warden kiss again, a tenderness in him not seen
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT	as their lips separate again.
KAREN	Nobody ever kissed me that way... not really...
WARDEN	Nobody?
KAREN	No. Nobody.
WARDEN	Not even one? Out of all the many men you've been kissed by?
KAREN	Well, that will take some figuring. How many men do you think there've been?
WARDEN	I wouldn't know. Can't you even make me a rough estimate?
KAREN	Not without an adding machine. Do you have your adding machine with you?
WARDEN	No, I forgot to bring it.
KAREN	Then I guess you won't find out, will you?
WARDEN	Maybe I already know.
KAREN	What's the matter? What are you hinting at?
WARDEN	Why? Is there something to hint at?
KAREN	I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe you just think there's a lot.
WARDEN	Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a long line of beach parties --
KAREN	You must be crazy -- !
WARDEN	Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here. But what about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss?
KAREN	I had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. For a minute I had to convince myself you were different --
WARDEN	Only it's true, ain't it?
KAREN	Yes, it's true! A part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. Some day perhaps you'll get all the story.
WARDEN	All what story?
KAREN	You're getting to sound so much like a typical male. So you just sweat it out like a typical male.
KAREN	All right. I've never told it to anyone before. But I think now is the time. I'll tell you the whole bloody messy thing. You can take it back to the barracks with you. She speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts. For much of the
KAREN	I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone.... I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens.
ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN	reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen.
KAREN	Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs.
WARDEN	Listen.
KAREN	He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine.
WARDEN	Listen. Listen. Please.
KAREN	And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on living with him.
WARDEN	The hateful, miserable --
KAREN	You hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again.
WARDEN	Listens Listen to me --
KAREN	All right. I'm listening.
KAREN	I know. Until I met you I didn't think it was possible, either.
PAN SHOT AROUND ROOM	Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a

TREADWELL	I bet I got two hundred blues records back home. But there ain't one could touch that. And that includes Saint Louis. And it could be ours...
PREW	I got it. We call it the `Re- enlistment Blues'!
PREW	Lookit, w e could start it with the guy getting discharged. Hey, fella, can I use this?
PREW	How's this? 'Got paid out on Monday... Not a dog soljer no more... They gimme all that money....'

PREW	You heard me -- rub your own nose in it a while!
GALOVITCH	What!
HOLMES	What's the matter with you, Prewitt? You know better than to talk back to a non-commissioned officer.
PREW	Yes, sir. But I have never liked being spit at, sir. Even by a non- commissioned officer.
HOLMES	I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.
PREW	I don't think I owe him no apology. In fact, I think one's owed to me.
HOLMES	Sergeant Galovitch, take this man to the barracks and have him roll a full field pack, extra shoes, helmet and all, and then take a bicycle and hike him up to Kole- Kole Pass and back. And see that he hikes all the way. And when he gets back, bring him to me.

MEDIUM SHOT	Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's Prew up and down, half-smiles.

PREW	No, sir, I'm not.
HOLMES	Take him back up there again, Galovitch. He hasn't had enough yet.
GALOVITCH	Yes, air.
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES	Holmes slams his fist on his desk.
HOLMES	1 know that kind of man! He's an againster. A bitter-ender. You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to tame him, like an animal! Warden, I want you to prepare court martial papers. Insubordination and insolence to an officer.
WARDEN	Yes, sir.
WARDEN	middleweight like that...
HOLMES	Why? Do you see any other way of breaking him?
WARDEN	I don't know... But even if he only gets three months, he'll still be in the Stockade when the boxing finals come up.
WARDEN	How about just giving him a good stiff Compny punishment for now?
HOLMES	All right, all right. But throw the book at him.
WARDEN	Yes, sir.
CLOSE SHOT WARDEN SHOOTING INTO SMALL MIRROR	
WARDEN	I'm sick of it! They ain't got no right to keep breakin it off in that kid! Sooner later Holmes is going to hound him right into the Stockade!
WARDEN	I'm through! I'm turnin in my stripes. I mean it, Pete. I could transfer out tomorrow. In Grade -- get that? To half a dozen Compnys in this Regmint!
KARELSEN	Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too, except I can't stand leaving all my old buddies.
WARDEN	Where you going, Little Sir Echo?
KARELSEN	To take my stinkin shower, if the First Sergeant's got no objections. Where'd you think? To the movies in this towel?

KARELSEN	The Canal Zone for me. This girl down there. She was a planter's daughter, see. She lived a very sheltered life. A very moral young lady, Milt. I took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing. It was a great shock to her to learn about life. But she took it well. She got to like me very much after that.
WARDEN	The last time I heard it you told it different.
KARELSEN	Well, what did you expect? I was in a different mood, then.
MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE	Maggio, Anderson and Treadwell are comparing snapshots from
MAZZIOLI	... it's in regulations. You've got a right to complain. You've got a right to take your case to the Inspector General. Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

MAGGIO	... believe it nor not, this is one soljer who's got a family -- look, fifteen of 'em. See that old man with the handlebars? Mr. Maggio is my father.
MAZZIOLI	Listen, Prew. I guess I ought not to tell you but --. Warden hasn't had you on KP much lately, has he?

WARDEN	Throw that knife on the floor.
WARDEN	Almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you? Is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you?

PREW	When you love something it doesn't mean they got to love you in return.
ALMA	Yes, but a person can stand just so much from something --
PREW	No! A man loves a thing, he's gotta be grateful. I left home when I was seventeen. Both my folks was dead, then. I bummed around. I got all sorts of jobs. I rode the rods. I landed in jails. I didn't belong nowhere. Until I entered the Profession.
PREW	The Army. I enlisted at Fort Myer and I learned how to box and I learned how to play a bugle. I never had much call for the boxing - - but if it weren't for the Army I'd never of learned how to play a bugle.
ALMA	A bugle?
PREW	This is the mouthpiece I used to play a Taps at Arlington.
PREW	They picked me to play a Taps -- at Arlington Cemetery.

WARDEN	What you hangin around here for?
LEVA	Can't a man rest himself for a min--

KAREN	It can't go on like this much longer, Milt.
WARDEN	I know.
WARDEN	If there were only a way! Your lovin husband'd probly give you the divorce. But even if he didn't know what for, he'd never let me transfer.
KAREN	There is a way. I've been thinking about it.
KAREN	You've got to become an officer.
WARDEN	What!
KAREN	You're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft. When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States -- new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men. Then --
WARDEN	You sure made a thorough study of it.
KAREN	Then I could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you.
WARDEN	An officer! I've always hated officers.
KAREN	That's a fine, intelligent point of view. Suppose I said I've always hated Sergeants. That would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?
CLOSE SHOT WARDEN	He sits, thinks it over unhappily.
WARDEN	Okay, suppose I did it. -- And don't think it's a cinch -- the exams are tough. Then you'd be getting your divorce here while I'm in the States. We'd be apart maybe six months! We'll probly be in the war by then --
KAREN	You can't be certain of that --
WARDEN	Put it down on your calendar. On October twenty-third, 1941, Milt Warden told you we'd be in the war in less than a year.
KAREN	Why don't you tell the truth? You just don't want the responsibility. You're probably not even in love with me --
WARDEN	You're crazy! I wish I wasn't in love with you. Maybe could enjoy life again.
KAREN	I don't know what's happened to you -- you were honest at first --
WARDEN	At first! You were tough and solid as a rock -- and now you're a whining crybaby --
KAREN	And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after.
WARDEN	I've never been so miserable in my life as I have since I met you.
KAREN	Neither have I. I wouldn't trade a minute of it.
KAREN	Neither would I.
WARDEN	I'll probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this Army. You'll make a fine officer. A remarkable officer.

PREW	A thirty-year man is movin all over, goin all the time. Up to now I never thought a thirty-year man had any business to think of gettin married.
ALMA	You're a funny one, little Prew boy.
PREW	Yeah. Must be the altitude.
ALMA	A very funny one that I cannot figure out.
PREW	Why's it funny if a guy wants to marry you?
ALMA	Because I'm a girl you met at the New Congress Club! And that's about two steps up from the pavement.
PREW	Okay -- I'm a private no class dogface soljer. And the way most civilians look at it, that's two steps up from no thin.
ALMA	Oh, Prew, Prew, I thought we were happy: Why do you want to spoil things?
PREW	Lissen, I ain't think in of now. But I got a plan cookin in my head. You want to go back to the States in a year. Well, you could stretch it some, make it two years. And I could swing a Sergeant's stripes -- If I were a non-com the Army'd let me pick my duty when I re-enlist. And there's some posts back in the States -- like Jefferson Barracks -- The married noncoms rate solid brick houses... with lawns with new- cut grass and walks with big old oak trees...
ALMA	Now I know you've lost your mind! How do you expect to become a Sergeant under this Captain Holmes of yours? It's all you can do to keep out of the Stockade!
PREW	I could fight.
PREW	It I go out for boxin he'd send me to non-com school. The Regimental Championship is next month. I bet I could win the middleweight even without training. I used to be pretty good I could do it.
ALMA	No. I don't think you should give in to The Treatment... even to marry me.
PREW	This'd be worth it. Prew -- it's true we love each other now. But back in America, it might be different... We might not even want each other...
PREW	Okay. But that ain't the real reason.
ALMA	All right. It's not.
PREW	What's the real reason you won't marry me?
ALMA	I won't marry you because I don't want to be the wife of a soldier.
PREW	Well, that's the top I could ever do for you --
ALMA	Because nobody's going to stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing. Because want to be proper.
PREW	Proper?
ALMA	Yes, proper. Respectable. Secure. In a year I'll have enough money saved. I'm going back to my home town in Oregon and I'm going to build a new home for my mother and myself and join the country club and take up golf. And then I'll meet the proper, man with the proper position. And I'll be a proper wife who can keep a proper home and raise proper children. And I will be happy because when you are proper you are safe.
PREW	You got guts, Alma. I hope you pull it off.
ALMA	you. Because I'm lonely. Sometimes I'm dreadfully lonely... You think I'm lying, don't you?
PREW	No. Nobody ever lies about being lonely...

HOLMES	You can't keep a thing like this HIDDEN&
KAREN	I'm not going to hide anything. I'm just not going to tell you. She applies herself to her food, anxious to drop the matter.
HOLMES	One thing I know. I know it's a civilian. You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.
KAREN	I don't think it's any of your business who he is.
HOLMES	It is my business! I'm your husband! What do you think a scandal would do to my chances for a promotion? So if you're thinking of a divorce, you can forget it!
HOLMES	Now -- how does it feel to know you'll have to live with a horror like me the rest of your life?
KAREN	Not very nice. But then there's the compensation of knowing you'll have to live with me the rest of your life.
HOLMES	You don't know how a man feels about a thing like this. It breaks a man all up -- inside.
KAREN	I gander why men feel so differently about it than women.
HOLMES	It's -- it's just not the same.
HOLMES	Why do you think I've done all I have...?
KAREN	Done all what?
HOLMES	Tried to be a Company Commander when I hate it, worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad, tagged after the General whenever I could.
KAREN	I don't know. Why?
HOLMES	Why, for you and for me. For our home, that's why.
KAREN	I always thought you did it because you wanted to get ahead.
KAREN	It's a lovely day out. I think I'll go for a walk.
HOLDS	I'm willing to forgive you. Tell me who he is. Make a clean breast of it. And I'll forgive you.
KAREN	I wonder which is hurt more -- your pride or your curiosity?
KAREN	When I'm ready to ask you for a divorce we can discuss it again. And do eat your breakfast, Dana. It's getting cold.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT HOLMES	wretched, completely at a loss. He stares into space, then

PREW	You see Maggio?
NAIR	Fatso's workin him over with a hoe handle. Places where it won't show mostly. You know, the back and the chest. The kidneys. Once in a while in the face. Know what Maggio does when that happens? Spits in Fatso's eye. Oh, he's a hot one. Ain't he a hot one?
PREW	He's a good boy.
NAIR	Course, he throws up a little blood now and then. And he passes out a lot. But Fatso sure ain't reportin none of that. So there's no way they goin to find out.
PREW	Why don't he go to the C.O.?
NAIR	We tried to get him to. But he won't peep. He says he got a lot more scalp to lose first. That boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital. But he's got a heart just like a great big baby.
PREW	You think he's gonna be all right?
NAIR	Your guess is worth mine, sam. Maybe he's crackin a little at that -- cause after Fatso put him in the Hole -- that's what they call solitary -- a couple times he began talkin about how he's gonna e- scape. He said to tell you he'll look you up one of these nights.

MEDIUM SHOT GENERAL SLATER COLONEL WILLIAMS HOLMES	
COLONEL WILLIAMS	--- In addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid Private Prewitt. This extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team. These findings are the result of personal investigation by the Inspector General and are corroborated by numerous members of G Company.
GENERAL SLATER	I'm waiting for your reply to this.
HOLMES	I haven't any, sir... The charges -- are true.
GENERAL SLATER	Holmes, the first thing I ever learned in the Army was that an officer takes care of his men. It seems to be the first thing you forgot. It's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops. And believe me, you won't be for long. My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded. In the meantime, of course, I'm relieving you of your present duties.
HOLMES	If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir. Any way...
COLONEL WILLIAMS	There is one alternative, General... if you're so disposed. A resignation for the good of the service under AR 600-275.
GENERAL SLATER	I'll give you a chance you don't deserve, Holmes. Write a letter of resignation and have it on my desk this afternoon. I'll consider accepting it. Only because as far as I'm concerned, the quicker you're out of the Army the better for everybody. Especially the Army.
MEDIUM SHOT KAREN AND HOLMES	He confronts her, waving a sheet of stationery. His voice is
HOLMES	--- that's right, it's a letter of resignations I'm through! I've already been relieved! So you can begin packing. We're sailing for the States next week! Where has it gone, Karen? What happened to it? The gay, cheerful life we were going to have, you and I...? What happened to me...? The proud, dashing officer was going to be. The leader of men?... I've known all along how the men felt about me. They despised me... What's happened? I don't remember losing anything... Where has it all gone?

ROSS	-- I don't intend to have a sloppy outfit. I don't intend to have a goldbrick outfit. I don't intend to have a soft soap outfit. I've called you noncoms in because you're the backbone of any Company. From now on you'll have to prove you're entitled to have those stripes here. And not in the boxing ring.
ROSS	Get rid of these, Sergeant.
LEVA	Yes, sir.
ROSS	That's all I have to say. If you've any questions, speak up.
ROSS	Dismissed.
WARDEN	One non-com was missing, sir. Sergeant Galovitch.
ROSS	I know. Private Galovitch is in the kitchen.
WARDEN	In the kitchen?
ROSS	As of now, he's an assistant cook. I busted him. On a blanket charge of inefficiency. What are you grinning at?
WARDEN	I think the Company Commander made a wise decision, sir. Compny G, First Sergeant Warden speaking.

WARDEN	I wanted to -- I tried -- but I couldn't...
WARDEN	Lissen -- there's a kid in our outfit named Prewitt... Robert E. Lee Prewitt... He came in from the States about a year ago. I thought he was a fresh punk at first... until I got to know him a little. He's AWOL right now -- probly in some kind of real trouble -- he ain't the kind to go AWOL otherwise. Anyway, I keep remembering somethin he said to me the first day he came in. He said a man has got to go his own way... if he don't, he's nothin... I'm an Enlisted Man. I'm a First Sergeant. Milt Warden. Once I cross that line and tried to be an officer, I'm somebody I don't know. A stranger. And a man has got to be what he is...
KAREN	I guess that's the trouble with Dana... He's always tried to be something he isn't. Poor Dana... I don't think he ever needed me until now. Well, here we are saying goodbye. And talking about two other people.
WARDEN	We're not saying good-bye -- we'll figger out a way for you to stay HERE --
KAREN	I'm going back with him, Milt. There's something in being needed. It isn't love. But it's something. Lissen, two people who love each other just don't stop loving each other! Nothin and nobody is goin to break us up l 1111 transfer out somehow and get back to the States. Maybe it'll take a little time but I'll do it!
KAREN	That sounds like Milt Warden, all right.
KAREN	No, Milt. I don't want to kiss you any more. I just want to remember you. And you to remember me.
