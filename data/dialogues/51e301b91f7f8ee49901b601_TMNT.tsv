SPLINTER (V.O.)	A sensei once counseled a grief- stricken boy, as his older brother prepared to leave for battle. N STARS - Begin to see a DOZEN or so stars, almost forming a He said, "Child, why do you cry? You are both part of a family. And a family is a bond that cannot be broken by war. By strife.

PANTERA	After all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA. They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING. The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits

PANTERA	Idiota! Watch where you're going!
DRIVER SOLIDER	There's a log on the road, senor. ...that wasn't there an hour ago.
PANTERA	Well, what are you waiting for?!
REMOVE IT!	Cortez! Andelay!
B	CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep ...yirk! ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.
DRIVER SOLIDER	D-d-dios mio. ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

PANTERA	What?! The jungle god that punishes those who prey upon the weak. He's coming... for us.
O	ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.
DRIVER SOLIDER	I'm sorry, senor. Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look. ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying -a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him! ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked. An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
ANTERA	I am not afraid of a myth!
TTACKER (O.S.)	Actually... it's "Turtle", pal. Pantera swings around. Eyes wide. N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and The poncho falls to the ground. ON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in

OY VILLAGER	The Ghost of the Jungle. Leo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them
LEONARDO	My training is now complete. The camera lifts away from Leo... and then PLUNGES into the - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera, Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.
MUGGER	Heh, heh... suckers. ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
MUGGER	Whaaa!!! The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in

W	HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET, THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
NYPD #1	...whoa.
NYPD #2	The Nightwatcher. ON MUGGER - Hung upside down by a chain. Purse hangs from his WIDER - A quieter area of the city. Broken by the squealing
APHAEL	Heh, heh. Nice try, chump. QUICK SHOTS - Ignites and revs engine. Straps helmet back on.
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)	Dude... I'm scared! CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF TURTLE EYES... MICHAELANGELO'S! They're
MICHAELANGELO	Dude! They're all around me! What do I do? WHAT DO I DO?! Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in
DONATELLO (O.S.)	Just relax, Mikey. Remember your training. You'll be fine.
MICHAELANGELO	But I need back up this time, man! ...you're such a prima donna. CAM PULLS BACK TO REVEAL WE'RE IN-
MICHAELANGELO	Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!! Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run
SCREAMING KIDS	Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey! Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork! End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on
KEEEEYA!	This was the best birthday ever, Mommy! Mikey GROANS as we- Thanks so much. You're worth every penny. I have to tell all my friends about you. You'll love their kids too.
MICHAELANGELO	I can only hope they're as lovely as the rugrats you got here. ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a
MICHAELANGELO	Such... angels. Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack
SOCCER MOM	Okay! Everyone say good-bye to Cowabunga Carl! BYE!
MICHAELANGELO	Hyuk! Cowabunga dudes! Bye! ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom turns back, a green hand
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)	Heheh... score. Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat WIDER - the van takes off down the street. Hey, hey, hey... don't forget the face thing. OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
MICHAELANGELO	Yes... sir.
DONATELLO (O.S.)	That's a good boy.
MICHAELANGELO	All's I'm saying Donnie is that no one would notice if YOU did one of these gigs every now and again. But you add such... panache to the character. Mikey, emotional, pops into "fully animated" facial mode. He
MICHAELANGELO	Well, if panache is French for "punching bag", I'd have to agree with ya. A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's,
DONATELLO	Close enough. I - uh-oh- ON MONITOR - Don watches Mikey through a TRAFFIC CAM in front -you got a peeping tom.
M	
MICHAELANGELO	Aw nuts. Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
MICHAELANGELO	Just get me outta here, dude. ON DON - He hits some switches. Monitors change.
DONATELLO	Traffic's clear eastbound for two blocks. Then hook up with route J. BACK WITH MIKEY - He's still waving with a frozen smile.
ICHAELANGELO	Righteous. Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and
M	along with his gaining speed. You HAD to install the music too...
DONATELLO (O.S.)	All part of the cover, my friend. The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate The dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's Mikey lands in the "foyer" of sorts. Atop entrance stairs. He
MICHAELANGELO	Honeeeeey! I'm hooome! As Mikey slides down the banister, the cam dollies around
I	behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to fresh eyes.
DONATELLO	Moneymoneymoneymoney. As Donnie walks away, Mikey LOUDLY CLEARS HIS THROAT. Don
MICHAELANGELO	Domo arigato, dude. Mikey walks into the room and plops down on a sofa. Hits a Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps to obedience.
MICHAELANGELO	Yes, sensei. ANGLE ON - SPLINTER the Japanese rodent master and father of
SPLINTER	Well?
P	
MICHAELANGELO	Sensei? Oh! Here ya go, Master Splinter. Mikey reaches into his bag and removes a foil-wrapped piece
SPLINTER	Ahh! Butter creme frosting! Donatello walks to Splinter. Holds his hand out, judgmental.
DONATELLO	Master. No cake. You remember your last cholesterol tests.
SPLINTER	But I- -Donatello! I am your Master!
DONATELLO	Nice try, sensei. But you can still be my Master... with low cholesterol. Splinter surrenders the cake. As Don walks away,
SPLINTER	He-heh. You have done well, my son. Donatello walks to the fridge and opens it - FILLED with The street noise below is barely audible. Camera creeps along
APRIL (O.S.)	Careful! That isn't some box full of fish! CAM LOWERS - as APRIL O'NEIL leaps down into frame. Dressed
APRIL	Where are you? A spacious NYC loft - tons of bookcases work as room CAM PANS ACROSS ROOM - The telephone continues to ring just - CASEY JONES, snoring on a sofa. He finally wakes up, Talk to me.
APRIL	Hey. It's me. I'm back. Casey rubs his face, tries to orient himself. Looks at watch.
CASEY	Was that today, babe? April's disappointed. Same old Casey.
APRIL	Yes. It was today that I returned to you after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month. I thought you were going to meet me down here?
CASEY	I'm sorry, babe. I must've-
APRIL	Forget it. I'll take a cab. A long pause on the phone. Casey knows he's busted.
CASEY	I missed you? April doesn't answer. She closes the phone. Casey slumps in
CASEY	Good goin', Case. Back at the dock, April is back to business.
APRIL	Howie! Get this on the truck for delivery! Let's go! P.O.V. INSIDE BOX - See April through the wood slats. We'd Mikey is on his bed. His thumbs pound away at a video game on He stands up and walks to DON'S ROOM. He opens it. It takes
MICHAELANGELO	Don, y'ever feel like you were meant for more? To DO more? Like, I mean, sometimes I feel like...
D	like we never really left that glass turtle bowl when we were little dudes. REVERSE ANGLE - Don lifts his head up, eyes MAGNIFIED in some
ONATELLO	Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?
MICHAELANGELO	Every day it's the same thing. Wake up. Birthday party gig. Drive home. Watch TV. Train... Rinse. Repeat.
DONATELLO	I know. Isn't it great? A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING
SPLINTER	Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an indicator of your surroundings. It is a reflection of your inner heart. Fill yourself with excitement on the inside... and you'll live the most rewarding life of all. Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to
NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)	And so yet again, police officials are baffled at a crime of retribution that can only be attributed to the mysterious figure M known as "The Nightwatcher". ikey lights up. On TV is a flashy well-coifed, know-nothing
NYC DIRT REPORTER	This is the latest in a string of vigilante acts that have been plaguing the city for the past year.
S	Although the victims have been criminals themselves, the Nightwatcher's actions have been identified as destructive and overly-violent... verging on the edge of lethal. ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,
MICHAELANGELO	Now THAT'S what I'm talking about! Cruising the streets, busting those who hold themselves above the law. But they aren't above HIS. Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.
DONATELLO	Mikey, the man's practically a criminal himself. Anyone who operates without boundary or rule of law cannot be legislated and needs to be reigned in.
RAPHAEL (O.S.)	Sounds like four turtles I used ta know. ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where
RAPHAEL	Whatta we talkin' about, boys? Soundin' a little too egghead fer my tastes.
PLINTER	Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I were just discussing the vigilante Nightwatcher once again. Where have you been? You've been spending so much time away from home lately... Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.
RAPHAEL	I joined a book a' the month club. So just what's your beef with puttin' dirtbags behind bars, Donnie? Go ahead... enlighten me. Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.
DONATELLO	I have no problem with the incarceration of those who deserve it, but if someone like Nightwatcher has ultimate power... then who makes sure he doesn't cross the line? Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around
MICHAELANGELO	I think he's COOL.
DONATELLO	Of course you would.
MICHAELANGELO	Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!
RAPHAEL	Sometimes there are lines that even the police can't cross. Someone has to be willing to do what needs to be done. And to do that, fear becomes a weapon.
DONATELLO	You are such a Neanderthal. Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick
APHAEL	I rest my case. Raphael! If bullying is the only perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with.
APHAEL	Yes, sensei. And quit touchin' my stuff. Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms
DONATELLO	That was just a startle response and isn't really an indication of fear! Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A
DONATELLO	It's an involuntary thing your body does when stimulated like that. What? It's true. A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the Disgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat...
LEONARDO	Mmm... home sweet home. All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only He tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor, avoiding Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting
SPLINTER	Enter. Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter.
LEONARDO	I have completed my training, master. I am prepared for the next stage.
SPLINTER	That you are, my son. You must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life. THAT will be the most challenging training of all... plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION. CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES,
SPLINTER	I've missed you, Leonardo.
L	eo hugs Splinter.
LEONARDO	I've missed you too, father.
SPLINTER	I'm afraid much has changed in your brothers' spirits since you have left. But now that you are home, they will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been lacking. The family needs you. ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard.
LEONARDO	Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.
SPLINTER	Raphael, your brother is home.
LEONARDO	Hey.
RAPHAEL	Hey. Raphael eyes Leo... and then the medallion.
RAPHAEL	So... congratulations.
LEONARDO	Thanks.
RAPHAEL	Well, I'm goin' to bed. He leaves. TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back
RAPHAEL	Leo's home. Donatello wakes up, looks around. LIGHTS UP when he sees Leo.
DONATELLO	Leo!! ON MIKEY - He wakes up. A Cheese Doodle stuck to his upper
MICHAELANGELO	But I don't WANNA pop out of the birthday cake, Mrs. Ro-
LEOOOOO!!!	Mikey flips past Donnie and slams Leo with a gripping HUG...
LEONARDO	Mikey? You can let go now... um, Mikey? So bored... so bored... VER BLACK - Quick bursts of AUDIO VIOLENCE. Steel, It was all a nightmare. We go WIDER as we take in the inters is large, handsome, built and powerful in every Mr. Winters, sir. ON DOORWAY - Standing there is a beautiful black-haired
WINTERS ASSISTANT	It's time for your morning workout. Rock/hip-hop music crashes in as we see Winters' morning Sequence ends with him smashing the top off of a Mook Jung Winters walks in his crisp suit. His office is large and Mr. Winters, sir? ON DOOR - His Assistant stands at the large doors.
WINTERS ASSISTANT	The board is waiting.
WINTERS	Excellent. He walks to the large bay windows that overlooks the city. Now outside the window, he smiles at the view.
WINTERS	Tell them I'm on my way down. He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME. CAM PULLS OUT WIDER REVEALING - We see the wonder of everything Winters - mixing of old
W	inters' Elevator Office lowers into a balcony level building Winters walks in the room. CLOSE ON him as he stops at the
INTERS	Gentlemen! Let's begin. CAM PULLS BACK along the impossibly long table as DOZENS OF
MICHAELANGELO	Leo... what's up, bro?
LEONARDO	Just enjoying being home. hey walk past Donnie's Chop Shop room as - BOOM! - something
CONTROL!	Mikey and Leo COUGH, leave the smokey area.
LEONARDO	Say, what's up with April and Casey? I expected them to drop by after I got back.
MICHAELANGELO	We don't see much of `em anymore. April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be, I dunno, "different" lately. Maybe he doesn't like having to put the toilet seat down now that they've moved in together.
LEONARDO	They're living together now? They get to the living room area. Mikey walks to the edge of
MICHAELANGELO	To be honest with ya, they're kinda buzzkills to be around.
LEONARDO	Is Casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing?
K	
MICHAELANGELO	Dunno. Haven't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to roost. WOOOOHOOOOOOOO!
LEONARDO	"Nightwatcher"? That some new comic book you're hooked on, Mikey? RAPHAEL walks in. Picks up Mikey's scrapbook as he passes the
RAPHAEL	This should explain most of it. The legacy of the city's newest hero. Compliments of the fanboy over there. M
ICHAELANGELO	Joke all you want, Raphy. But train hard and eat your veggies and one day, you too can be as cool as The Nightwatcher, dude.
RAPHAEL	I can only hope, Mikey. I can only hope... Leo disapprovingly flips through the book.
LEONARDO	This guy could bring heat on all of us if he keeps this up. Showboating isn't a replacement for justice... it's just self-indulgence. Someone needs to talk to this thug. ON RAPH - He looks... dying to say something. But can't. CLOSE ON - A familiar-looking white HOCKEY MASK. Eyes blink
ID 1	Yo, Case? Wanna be goalie? The mask is pushed aside by Casey - Kid 1 was holding it.
CASEY	Nah, you know I work for a livin'. It's Star Center or nothin' else. WIDER - Casey is with 5 other KIDS prepping for a game of
KID 2	Whatever! Let's get it on! They begin a boisterous round of hockey. Trash talk, gentle
BROOKLYN MOM	Tommy's defeated. Looks at the disappointed boys.
TOMMY	Sorry dudes.
CASEY	Busted! Have fun with your mommy... ...oh no. OFF HIS LOOK - We see APRIL, dressed stunning in a dark
ASEY	Aw, c'mon April! We just started! April just gives him "the look" with an eyebrow cock. Casey
KID 2	Can't Casey stay and play for just five more minutes, Miss O'Neil? Pleeeeeeease?
APRIL	Not today, Nate. Mister Jones has to pretend to be an adult for a few hours.
KIDS	Awwwww! Man! Baaah! Casey hands his stick, then quickly turns with a grin.
CASEY	Later boys! CAM FOLLOWS April and Casey as they walk down the street. the relationship.
PRIL	I need your help with a delivery.
CASEY	Do you need my funtahstick muscles? Heh-heh... yeah. Casey awkwardly places his arm over her shoulder as the cam The doors open in Winters Lobby. April struts in, owning the
RECEPTIONIST	Mr. Winters. April O'Neil is here. Winters sits at his large desk as the large doors open and
WINTERS	Miss O'Neil. You are a vision. Thirty days in a jungle, and beautiful as ever. He shakes her hand and double-cheek kisses her. Casey's eyes
APRIL	Hello Max. This is my... friend, Casey Jones.
WINTERS	Chris! How's it going? Winters nearly crushes Casey's hand in his grip.
CASEY	Actually, It's Ca-
WINTERS	So how was your trip?
APRIL	You know, the typical - corrupt government officials, double crossed by a jungle guide, all ending in a heart-pounding chase. Winters and April chuckle. Cam adjusts to show Casey between
APRIL	But it was all worth it. I found it. The fourth General. Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her
CASEY	Yeah-ha! The fourth General.
APRIL	The crow-bar.
CASEY	Oh. He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK ...the gods be praised. ON BOX - We finally see the statue - GENERAL AGUILA - a seven-
APRIL	Can I ask you a question?
WINTERS	
Y	es. Of course.
APRIL	I've been so grateful for the opportunities you've given me lately. I'd probably be still selling antique curios if you hadn't visited my shop that day. But I have to ask... why the fascination with these particular works of art? I'd never even heard of the Legend of Yaotl until we met. He looks up. The cam PANS RIGHT. It travels past an SUIT OF
WINTERS (V.O.)	It was a time long before the Mayans, April. Long before the Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was a time of legends. A time of greatness. The true mother culture of Central America. Cool shots of Yaotl. His armor, his stance, etc.
INTERS (V.O.)	There was a man named Yaotl. More a force of nature than man. And together with his Four Warrior- Priest Generals, they pillaged every culture in their path. QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
WINTERS (V.O.)	And for every culture they destroyed, they drank in all the magic and knowledge known to them.
O	They became a warring hurricane, gathering more power and knowledge with each conquest. GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally
WINTERS (V.O.)	Then they came across a culture rich with science, magic and their own technology. A South American version of "Atlantis". It was like blood in the water for a predator like Yaotl. CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM
WINTERS (V.O.)	As the army approached, Yaotl used the knowledge they'd gained in black magic and sorcery. Timing their attack with the alignment of the Stars of Kikin, they opened a portal to another world. ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit
WINTERS (V.O.)	They unleashed an army of monsters. N BATTLEFIELD - men getting slaughtered (in a nice PG sort
WINTERS (V.O.)	The monsters knew no side - they destroyed the enemy... as well as Yaotl's own army. Men who swore to spill their blood for his cause. Yaotl had to do something to stop more from coming through.
W	inters SMASHES the portal, stopping the slew of monsters
A	Desolate, destroyed battlefield. Smoldering. Bodies
WINTERS (V.O.)	In the end, there were no victors. And they were responsible for the eradication of the greatest culture that will never be known. The knowledge that was lost would never be found again...
ASEY	I was just resting my eyes...
APRIL	Quite the story, Max. You don't think that this could be-
WINTERS	Oh no, Miss O'Neil. Like you said... just a story. inters doesn't break his stare.
WINTERS	One of the girls will pay your fee on the way out.
PRIL	Thanks. Um... goodbye... Max. April and Casey leave Winters, consumed with his new April and Casey walk the lobby. She shoots him "the look".
CASEY	What!? It was a boring story!
APRIL	That is so perfectly CASEY JONES. I give you opportunity. I give you the chance to become a better man. And what do you do with it?
W	Casey stops next to a PODIUM holding a priceless-looking
CASEY	Well, maybe if you were home for more than four days at a time, you'd see that I DON'T WANT ANY OF
APRIL	Casey, you better be careful-
CASEY	Here I am nice enough to help you out, dress in this get-up and all I get is grief?! ...as he knocks and SMASHES the vase to the floor.
CASEY	Oh boy. Klaxons sound as SHINK-SHINK-SHINK - METAL PLATES SLAM DOWN
APRIL	Give me strength. Winters is still alone in his office. Still studying the
WINTERS	You can come out now. IDER - As we see FOUR FIGURES appear out of the smallest and
S	woman - dressed in cloak and Japanese Noh mask over her face.
WINTERS	Your talents are commendable.
KARAI	As are yours. Most don't notice us until we decide they will.
WINTERS	Well, I guess I'm just special that way. Winters walks over to his desk. The Statue looms behind them.
WINTERS	So down to business - aside from the other reasons for your visit to America, are you interested in my offer we discussed?
KARAI	I must confess... I still don't know exactly what we are to do for you.
WINTERS	I need the finely-tuned eyes and stealth of your Foot Ninja to... monitor the city for me over the next few days. Winters walks to his window. It's night. Overlooks the city.
WINTERS	Just keep your eyes peeled for anything... strange.
KARAI	What kind of strange things? The question hangs as we PUSH IN ON Statue's face... his The glowing eye is really a STAR. The same line pattern we CAM LOWERS, placing us back in- A MAN walks down the sidewalk. As he passes a DARKENED ...WHAM! The requisite CAT jumps out of the shadows. Scares
WAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!	Gave me a scare kitty. He pets the kitty a bit, then walks off. CAM LOWERS behind
C	AM LOWERS further through the asphalt, then quickly hooks up Does ANYBODY train anymore?!
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)	Just a sec, dude! I'm almost at level eighteen. Scratch that... seventeen.
DONATELLO (O.S.)	In... uh... a few minutes, Leo. I'm in the middle of- KZZZT-BOOOM! - An OS invention blows up.
DONATELLO (O.S.)	Um... make that another hour. Leo sighs. Splinter walks by, not stopping.
SPLINTER	A true leader knows how to motivate his troops regardless of their own motivations. Splinter walks past a large FUSE BOX. Leo thinks a beat. Then WIDE SHOT OF LAIR MAIN ROOM as - KACHUNK! - the entire room Aw man! What's goin' on?! WHO Ninja tag, topside! A DEEP VOICE chants OS in a South American tongue as HIGH- Music builds as we see quick shots of the granite cracks The boys stand high atop the city below. Readying to run a

DONATELLO	-does the other team's chores for a week. Leo and Raph glare at each other.
LEONARDO/RAPHAEL	Deal.
MICHAELANGELO	I'm with Leo!
DONATELLO	Actually, I think you and I should pair up, Mikey.
MICHAELANGELO	You kiddin' me?! I mean, no offense Donnie, but you ain't exactly the biggest hitter on the bench.
DONATELLO	Just trust me on this one. Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick
LEONARDO	Have you been avoiding me? Barely seen you since I got home.
RAPHAEL	I been busy. I see. So... you're definitely not upset at me or anything, right?
RAPHAEL	Why'd you think that?
LEONARDO	I don't know... your brother gets to go on a world-wide training mission and you have to stay home. Might upset me too.
RAPHAEL	Are you trying to make me mad?
LEONARDO	I'm just saying, I'd understand if you were upset. Their intensity ESCALATES.
RAPHAEL	You wouldn't understand the first thing about me, daddy's boy - OOF!. hey both trip over a duct, tumbling in a ball. They stop
LEONARDO	Is that what this is about? You think Splinter likes me best?
RAPHAEL	You'd love that, wouldn't you?
M	WIDER - Don and Mikey are already sitting there.
MICHAELANGELO	So nice of you to join us, gentledudes.
DONATELLO	And by the way, I prefer the classic military corner tuck for my bedsheets.
M	ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren't amused. They
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)	Whoa! Whawazzat?! The others rush over to the edge with Mikey.
ICHAELANGELO	You dudes see that up there? OFF HIS LOOK - We see LARGE SHADOWS moving with in a large I-
MICHAELANGELO	So what now, captain?
LEONARDO	We need to come up with a plan.
RAPHAEL	Later! Raph RUNS OFF toward the action. But Raph doesn't stop. All three look at each other. Then-
MICHAELANGELO	Welcome home. The boys cross over on a large CONSTRUCTION CRANE and scale ON WALL - Deep CLAW MARKS are carved into the steel, much
DONATELLO	Guys, I've got a bad feeling...
RAPHAEL	Ahh, let's take a tiny peek. They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.
MICHAELANGELO	Well, there's a good/bad news scenario for ya. CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor.
MICHAELANGELO	Good news is that there are a buncha Foot Ninja gettin' the snot kicked out of `em. CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI
ICHAELANGELO (O.S.)	Bad news is WHAT's kickin' the snot out of `em... ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner
ONATELLO	An interesting conundrum. Do we hold dear the value of life and help the Foot regardless of our tumultuous past?
MICHAELANGELO	I vote for sitting back and enjoying the show. Whaddaya say, leader boy? ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered.
RAPHAEL	Nah. We kick butt. Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.
EONARDO	Who are YOU?! ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact. Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.
RAPHAEL	Nice of ya's ta join me. But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the
YEEEAAAAARGGHHH!!!!!	The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.
MICHAELANGELO	What? I saw it on a nature show once. The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out. NGLE ABOVE TURTLES - As a large teetering pallet filled with RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a ...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS!

RAPH!	Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he enters the sewer. The
A	beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for another peek.
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)	Y'know, it's not that bad, dudes. ON BUILDING - Actually, the place is destroyed. Dented, torn UP ANGLE on the Tower. Dead of night. No one around. A cavernous structure. Dimly lit. High ceiling. A few odd We hear the clicking of Winters' shoes echo as he enters.
WINTERS	What seems to be the problem? Karai and six Ninja are already there.
KARAI	The "problem" is that we were hired to merely patrol the city and report anything "strange" to you.
W	You never said anything about
MONSTERS.	Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take
INTERS	So, your job duties were just redefined. Congratulations on your promotion. SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-
KARAI	We may be hired help to you, but you should never forget... we are the Foot Clan. ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.
WINTERS	Oooooooh... It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH. The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
WINTERS	I believe we made a deal, Karai. I expect you to honor it. You do understand "honor", don't you? Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.
WINTERS	So I don't care what part of "muscle for hire" you don't understand. I hired your muscle. Now exercise the ones attached to your feet and... ...get back to work.
W	a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.
INTERS	So I will double... no, no... TRIPLE your pay for your troubles. Are we cool? ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
WINTERS	Are we... cool? The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.
WINTERS	Ninjas. No sense of humor. So how did we fare? CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
WINTERS	So it begins... It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
WINTERS	Were there any problems? AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
GENERAL AGUILA	None, my lord.
WINTERS	You see, now THAT'S a good soldier. You two should compare notes. Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not
KARAI	Just what is this all about?
WINTERS	Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt. I now have the power and know-how, but I need the speed and stealth of an organization such as your own. Not to mention an organization that values discretion.
KARAI	But of course.
WINTERS	You see, I have nine more beasts like this that should be coming to town very soon. Thirteen in all, to be exact. The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
ARAI	But... why? Why here? Why now?
WINTERS	Instinct, mostly. They're animals at their core. And they recognize something familiar in the air... in the stars. What can I say? I'm a lover of animals. The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some
W	we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.
INTERS	So you go and get to know each other. And don't forget... play nice. The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door.
KARAI	Not now. Our business will be handled at a later time... After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters. Quiet.
MICHAELANGELO	Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night? Oi, my head... Don pours over a thick book on MONSTERS AND MYTHOLOGY.
DONATELLO	Was it just me, or did that creature look familiar?
RAPHAEL	We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner.
LEONARDO	Fact remains, Raph, that we should have never been there in the first place.
APHAEL	Well, I suppose that we shoulda let Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city... oh wait... HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER TRYIN' TA KILL US!!! Good call, fearless leader.
ONATELLO	Come to think of it, it WAS pretty strange to see the Foot too. And who was that woman?
MICHAELANGELO	I dunno, but she sure gave Leo a run for his money.
LEONARDO	This is my fault now, Raph? I'm the only one who has to be responsible!
RAPHAEL	Hey, you're the "trained master", not me.
MICHAELANGELO	Dudes-can-it-here-comes-Splinter. ON DOOR - Splinter walks in, HUMMING to himself.
SPLINTER	Good morning, my sons.
TURTLES	Morning, sensei. Splinter makes himself a TEA. Room is SILENT.
SPLINTER	If anyone needs me, I'll be watching my stories.
S	plinter walks out. OS sound of the TV being turned on. At
LEONARDO	Hothead.
RAPHAEL	Splinter-junior.
NYC DIRT REPORTER (O.S.)	And in the latest of a string of strange criminal activity, a construction site was nearly destroyed last night. Authorities believe a violent battle had taken place earlier that evening. The boys react and rush into the MAIN LIVING AREA.
SPLINTER	My sons, what- Splinter's eyes go wide. He looks at his boys listening to
SPLINTER	I believe you boys have some explaining to do...
M	Splinter looks at the Turtles. Busted, as we-
SPLINTER	Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you. You are the leader of your brothers. I was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family.
LEONARDO	But Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so when Ra-
SPLINTER	There are no excuses when you are the Leader, my student. ON LEO - Biting his tongue. Hard.
SPLINTER	But the involvement of the Foot and their mysterious leader worries me.
ICHAELANGELO	I'm personally worried about a monster running around the streets of New York. But hey, that's just me. Don elbows Mikey back in line.
RAPHAEL	We hafta go out and find who's responsible for this. There ain't no other solution.
SPLINTER	Raphael, there are better ways to use your skills in ninjitsu. Fact- gathering. Analysis. Observation. Direct contact should only be your last resort.
RAPHAEL	Wow, sounds... exciting.
LEONARDO	Save the brute vigilante junk for that Nightwing guy.
N	"Nightwatcher".
LEONARDO	Whatever. Raph stands and exits the room. The others stay silent as we- QUICK SHOTS - Nightwatcher gearing up. ightwatcher emerges from a MAN HOLE. Walks to a long- N BIKE - Explodes out of a BACK ALLEY and into the night. Various shots of Nightwatcher tearing all over the city. On Aggressive and driving music. Various shots of the Stone - The Generals capture a Sloth-like creature, jumping in - The Generals capture a werewolf-like creature in the high-
APRIL (O.S.)	You sure you don't want to spar a bit? April is dressed in work-out gear on a grouping of floor
CASEY	Nah. Ever since you started with the blade weapons you, um... you kinda scare me.
APRIL	Suit yourself. Case?
CASEY	Yeah? Are you happy? I mean, with your life. With me. Casey pauses a beat. Tries to be upbeat.
CASEY	Yeah. Sure. You? April thinks just as much.
APRIL	Yeah. They sit on that for a moment. Casey leans in for a kiss.
CASEY	I'm going outside for some air. Casey slips out onto the fire escape. April knows better.
APRIL	Be safe. BAM! - the leather fist of Nightwatcher slams Burglar back,
IGHTWATCHER	Funny how you jerks don't care about crossing the line `til someone else does it... all over yer HEAD! Night hurls him back into a roof access door, denting it.
BURGLAR	
NIGHTWATCHER	Boy, oh boy, did YOU pick the wrong night to be a criminal... Night cocks his fist just as- Hey champ. You think you're being a little rough on the guy? ight slowly turns around. Menacing. Casey's taken aback.
CASEY	Are you that Nightwatcher fella? A little smaller than I expected.
RAPHAEL	Case? No way!
CASEY	I'm talkin' to you, pal. You think you own these rooftops? Well, lemme teach you a thing'r two. Class is Pain 101. Meet your instructor... Casey Jones. It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by You keep on playing with fire, little man, you might just get burnt.
CASEY	Raph?! Is that you?! What-what are you doing?! Are you pretending to be... ON RAPH - His eyes look around for an answer. Nothing.
CASEY	Why would you- -oh. So that would mean... Raph smiles... the first genuine one he's had in a long time.
RAPHAEL	Yep. IN BG - The Burglar tries to get away. Casey and Raph both
RAPHAEL	I dunno, I just got tired of the "nothing". Sitting around waiting for some disaster to cross our paths. Of us battling Utroms and Triceratons or any other friggin' creature... when there was still some guy gettin' mugged 100 feet above the lair. Just didn't seem right. `Specially if we had the means to do somethin' about it. Raph twirls a billy bat between his fingers. Stops.
RAPHAEL	And we did... but turns out I was the only one who was willing to do it, tho. So I just saved up, bought and tweaked a sweet bike, fitted the costume and began moonlighting. Papers called me "The Nightwatcher", so I went with it.
ASEY	"And a legend was born". So what was your handle before that?
RAPHAEL	I kinda liked "The Midnight Marauder"...
CASEY	Stick with Nightwatcher, ninja boy. The guys ever catch on?
RAPHAEL	Pfft. You kiddin' me? Leo's been away for, like, forever. And the other two are so wrapped up in that party business they'd never notice. So what about you? How's things with April? Haven't seen ya's since you two moved in together...
CASEY	They're good... I guess. I dunno, seems like all I do lately is just make her upset. She used to laugh so much... now it's mostly just working all day, and coming home to point out how I'm a screw up. She doesn't like me doing this. And I know she's pretending to not know I'm out tonight. But she knows. And she knows I know she knows. Life just kinda got complicated suddenly... y'know?
RAPHAEL	Yer tellin' me... Casey looks at his old bud.
CASEY	Raph?
RAPHAEL	Yeah?
CASEY	Nice to see ya, man. Raph acknowledges. The moment is broken by a HORRIBLE SHRIEK!
CASEY/RAPHAEL	What was that?! They both spring to their feet and run to the back of the
RAPHAEL	For old time's sake?
CASEY	What the shell. ON RAPH - He stops, mid-replacement of his helmet. Bro. Seriously. The two run and leap across the rooftops. Two vigilantes EDGE OF ROOFTOP - They look out. Silent.
CASEY	I think we lost it.
RAPHAEL	It's gotta be around here somewhere. SCREEEEECH!!! - A large VAMPIRE-LIKE CREATURE flies up from
WAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!	It's about to attack when - THUNKA-THUNKA-THUNKA - it's
RAPHAEL	Did I mention we ran into a monster last week?
ABOUT THAT ONE, BUDDY!	They inch closer to the edge. Peek over.
CASEY	The freakin' FOOT?! What about the walking statues? Were you going to mention THOSE?!
RAPHAEL	Nope. Those are a first for me too. We can take `em. One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER
CASEY	On second thought... The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a

ENERAL GATO	Witnesses. Aguila snarls and fires the tranq gun! Raph dives in front of
GENERAL AGUILA	Fetch. Gato SMILES as the other three board a Transport Vehicle.
CASEY	Not good. Raph takes out NINJA SMOKE PELLETS and throws them on the
NIGHTWATCHER	You ever heard of smoke pellets?
CASEY	Hey - you're the ninja, not me! BOOM! - Gato lands up on the roof and quickly gives chase! Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign. Then he sees it -
RAPHAEL	Bingo. Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC!
CASEY	What are we gonna do, Raph? WHAT
ARE WE GONNA-	-hey, cool ride.
RAPHAEL	Hop on. Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks
CASEY	Um, Raph? Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid- hisiscrazythisiscrazythisiscrazy. He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks ...and then -thumpthumpthump- Gato JUMPS DOWN TOWARD THEM!
CASEY	Oh crap. Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato
C	Gato comes close to breaking in. Very tense. Then-
ASEY	Okay, so it was great seein' ya again, Raph. Raph? ON RAPHAEL - He's got a dart in his shoulder, obsidian disks
CASEY	Gotta get you someplace safe, pal. And then, then I need to go buy some new undies. April is finishing up with her workout. She hears the fire
APRIL	Casey, I think we need to talk. I don't want- whoa. OFF HER LOOK - Casey is standing there, bracing the near-
CASEY	Could use a little... help here... Hey April... how ya been?
M	Raph passes out as we-
ICHAELANGELO	My compliments to zee chef. Le brrrraaaaaaapp! Mikey walks to the fridge of leftover birthday cake.
MICHAELANGELO	Anyone for dessert?
EVERYONE	
NO!!	The phone suddenly rings. Don rushes over to the jury-rigged Cowabunga-dude. Waita-slow down April. What happened to Raph? We'll be right there. ON WINDOW - One by one, Leo, Don and Mikey slip into the
M	and Casey. Mikey looks around.
ICHAELANGELO	Whoa... I am in the wrong line of work. Nice pad, kids. Don immediately starts checking Raph out.
DONATELLO	His vital signs seem to be okay. Pupil dilation is normal. Raph weakly pushes Donnie's head away. RAPHAEL Get the... frig offa me.
DONATELLO	Temper is normal too. He's going to be fine. Health-wise, I mean. Otherwise, he's still the same old Raph. Whoa. ON RAPH'S SHELL - Two Obsidian Disks are wedged in his back LOSE ON - Disk. It's beautiful and deadly. Don examines.
DONATELLO	Some sort of stone... probably obsidian, I think. There's an engraving on it. Looks... South American. Aztec? No. It's definitely not Mayan. April swallows hard.
APRIL	It can't be.
DONATELLO	What can't be, April? April sits down on the floor with the disk. Trying to figure
CASEY	Would it help things if I said that we were being chased by a one of those statues you collected for that Winters guy? ON APRIL - Her mouth is agape.
MICHAELANGELO	I'd say that's a big ten-four. It's just a myth... a legend. It can't be.
CASEY	And I suppose that bringing up the thirty-foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge, huh? ON APRIL - She slowly turns to Casey. Floored.
LEONARDO	What are you talking about Casey?
CASEY	Just some story this Winters guy told us. It all started down in South America. Long before the Ashmecks and the Macaroons.
APRIL	Azteks and Mayans.
CASEY	That's what i said.
APRIL	Sit down, Jones. So there was this guy call Yaotl... CAM PANS TO THE RIGHT - As it passes a FG element, the screen Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in
MICHAELANGELO	Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!!
APRIL	No one knows. The legend stops there. But it's just a legend. Donnie studies the tranq dart under a magnifying glass of
DONATELLO	The micro-tech of this dart is astounding. The molybdenum is of a grade only found in a few select markets... not to mention it's current stock is going for a little more than two-grand an ounce right now. What? I dabble in the market.
EONARDO	So what do we have? We have someone with a lot of money.
ONATELLO	Access to technology... and the means to produce it to exact specs.
RAPHAEL	Not to mention having a keen interest in these monsters... and them four stone jokers.
DONATELLO	If you ask me, it all somehow points to Winters Corp.
LEONARDO	How do you figure that, Donnie? Donatello looks up with MAGNIFYING GOGGLES on. Sarcastic.
DONATELLO	Hello? "Genius"? Well, that, and the fact that this part has a Winters Corporation logo on it.
EONARDO	Do you think he's trying to recreate the events from back then?
RAPHAEL	Well, what would you do with an army of monsters?
MICHAELANGELO	Well, aside from having your own wrestling league, I dunno... MAYBE
LEONARDO	Do bad guys still try to do that?
DONATELLO	Yes, however they're usually mortgage re-fi companies. What about it, April? You just finished working with the guy, right? Does it make sense?
APRIL	Guys! It's a legend!
R	
MICHAELANGELO	Is that "legend" like the ginormous freakin' hairball that attacked us?
APHAEL	Or "legend" like the moving statues and flying creature that attacked me n' Casey?
APRIL	Okay. Fine. I'll help for now... until we prove you're all insane.
LEONARDO	Or until we prove Winters is up to something more than collecting art.
DONATELLO	I'll work with April and see if these Stars of Kikin she told us about can give us any clues.
RAPHAEL	I say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person!
LEONARDO	Raph, that would be the worst idea yet. We hang back. Analyze. Formulate a plan, THEN storm your castle. Are we clear? Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway.
CASEY	Raph. Don't do it, man. I spent my whole life running out of rooms ticked off at the world. I wish I could take most of `em back. Sometimes, just takin' a breather is the best thing to do. ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is
RAPHAEL	Yeah... whatever. - and bolts out the door.
A	We see the same stars we've been tracking move closer into
PRIL (O.S.)	Think this is all of them, Donnie. ON DOOR - April walks in, holding a 3-foot-high stack of
APRIL	I cleaned out my archives on ancient South America. Might have found something useful. She takes out a hand-drawn map.
APRIL	A map of the stars, as recorded by an Aztec Shaman. They pinpoint the location of the Stars of Kikin... even though the names changed.
DONATELLO	For use in an Aztec calendar. So, if we can cross-reference our current star field, positioning of the Stars of Kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the Aztec
APRIL	-along with taking into account the point of origin of the first occurrence, we should know where another portal could take place. Max, what are you up to? Leo paces back and forth in the main area. Splinter walks in.
SPLINTER	Leonardo, time cannot be moved faster by wearing a groove in our floor.
MICHAELANGELO	Seriously, dude. We're all stressed. Try to chill.
LEONARDO	You're playing video games on the possible eve of Armageddon, Mikey. But I never said I was having fun. Leo looks at the clock.
LEONARDO	Where's Raph?
SPLINTER	Leonardo, a true leader knows the virtue of patience... and when to stop exercising it.
DONATELLO	We're almost done, Leo. You might want to go get him... If you can find him, that is. Leo looks at Splinter, clearly feeling leadership pressure Relatively peaceful. A few freighters off in the distance. Monay, monay, monay, MONAYYYY ...monay! POV FROM WATER - Steadicam shot, watching the man patrol The clicking intensifies. He follows the signal for twenty ..and comes up with a old unopened CAN OF SARDINES.
TREASURE HUNTER	Pfft. Figgers. He turns to leave the beach.
TREASURE HUNTER	Lousy metal detector. "Happy Anniversary" present, my big fat keister. He HURLS the can of sardines over his shoulder. Only, instead PTOOEY! - The tin "key" is spit back onto the sand. He bolts. It's dark. Barely lit in the hallways of the top private The camera travels the long and ornate hallways.

GENERAL AGUILA	Two creatures remain, my lord. A long beat. Winters closes his eyes.
WINTERS	Well, by all means then. Let's finish it. ON AGUILA - He squints. Deep in thought and not sharing. Nightwatcher runs along the rooftops. He pauses. He lifts his Classic Diner design, Pete's Diner is closed for the evening. A greasy DINER COOK finishes cleaning up the tables. He INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens. The man's face Nightwatcher hears the scream. Runs to the source and looks Night creeps to the freezer. He can hear the CHEWING and the -it's only THREE FEET TALL!

T	he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night ...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs
NIGHTWATCHER	Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't mess with the Nightwatcher! Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on
DINER COOK	Pl-pl-please don't hurt me!
NIGHTWATCHER	Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST
DINER COOK	Please, sir. I have kids. Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor.
NIGHTWATCHER	There ya go, pal. Make sure this is safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME?
HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY?	Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying

H	Tense stand-off as... Night suddenly bolts out the back as Night suddenly DASHES OUT into traffic! Jumping over passing
LEONARDO	Nice try, amateur. Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap!
LEONARDO	Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't you? They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top.
LEONARDO	Okay, someone's been training pretty hard. It begins to spit rain - and becomes a FRANK MILLER DOWNPOUR. Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the
LEONARDO	I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions. But you can't change the world like this. INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear
NIGHTWATCHER	Oh god. He's lecturing.
EONARDO	...so I'm going to give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense. Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him.
NIGHTWATCHER	Okay, Leo. Wanna play? Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with
LEONARDO	What? How did you- ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.
LEONARDO	Goodnight, dark prince. Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face
LEONARDO	R-raph? What? But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat.
AAAAAAAAGHH!!	He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock.
RAPHAEL	You're so friggin' smug! You think the world revolves around YOU, dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY survive without the mighty and powerful Leonardo to guide us through our problems, HUH?! Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we got along just fine without you.
LEONARDO	I was training! Training to be a better leader! For you! Why do you hate me for that?!
RAPHAEL	...and whoever said I wanted to be led? I shoulda gone on that training! OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient and hot-tempered! And more importantly... I'm better than you. Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and
RAPHAEL	Well, big brother, I'd have to disagree with you on that one. Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight. In another part of the city, the Generals have caught the
KARAI (O.S.)	The Foot report of strange activity five blocks north of your location.
GENERAL SERPIENTE	The final creature. Camera RISES UP until we reach the rooftop where Leo and Raph They battle. In the end, Raph becomes an uncontrollable ball It ends with Raph pinning Leo to the ground... holding a sai Tense. Raph shakes. He looks like he's going to do it... then Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother. CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over him. He looks up GATO POV - "reading" Leo on the ground. He frowns.
GENERAL GATO	It is neither monster nor human. CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile.
GENERAL AGUILA	Then he shall perfectly serve our purposes... let us inform our commander that the final creature has been captured. ON RAPH - He sees the commotion from afar... as Leo gets Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to the ground and eo!!! Hang on!! But the Caravan is too fast, and eventually loses Raph. Raph gets weak and collapses to his knees on the roof. The April and Don are poring over books at the kitchen. Mikey
SPLINTER	Raphael? What is the matter? I was out, and did... something... something happened and I- ARRRGH!!! Raphael picks up a HEAVY WEIGHT and hurls is across the dojo.
SPLINTER	Raphael! Kneel. Raph stops. Breathing heavy. Falls in line - walking to
RAPHAEL	I did something... I did something really stupid, Master Splinter.
SPLINTER	Go on... I know why you chose him now. I know that there's a reason why he's the better son and I'm not. And I think I made things worse tonight. A WHOLE lot worse... I know you must be ashamed of me, father. Raphael is lost in his guilt. Splinter kneels in front of
SPLINTER	Raphael. You always bear the world's problems on your shoulders. It is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others... plinter gently lays a hand on Raph's shoulder.
SPLINTER	But you must realize that while, at times, you may not be my favorite student, it does not mean that you are my least favorite son. Raphael looks up. Having not thought of it that way.
SPLINTER	You are strong, passionate and loyal to a fault. These are the merits of a great leader as well... but only when tempered with compassion and humility.
RAPHAEL	But Master Splinter, I messed up big tonight... I mean BIG. Splinter chews on this.
SPLINTER	Leonardo? R
APHAEL	Yes. Splinter is grim. Nods. But he moves on.
SPLINTER	Well then, I believe your brothers may be in need of a leader. Raphael looks up. Finally, his shot. He holds his SAIS in one
RAPHAEL	Thank you... father. Mikey bursts in the door, frantic.
MICHAELANGELO	Dudes. I think you're gonna want to check this out. Where's Leo? Raph and Splinter share a look. Raph has to tell the others. April and Donnie sift through their charts and calculations.
DONATELLO	So, the first time that this portal was opened, the Stars of Kikin aligned... ...and that's why it occurred in that specific South American region. Now if we take into account the continual rotation of the Earth since then, as well as the gradual celestial shift that's happened and been recorded over... well, over the course of that mountain of books over there... we now know our new location. Donnie's drawn a NEW LINE from the alignment of the stars.
APRIL	Precisely at 40.748 degrees latitude and -073.985 Degrees longitude. ON OTHERS - HUH?! Mikey air - calculates math in bg.
DONATELLO	New York City.
APRIL	Winters Tower.
DONATELLO	And the alignment is due to occur in precisely- - well... tonight. It sits in the room. Heavy.
MICHAELANGELO	But without Leo... what do we do? No one answers. Splinter looks to Raph. Raph steps up.
RAPHAEL	New York City. Splinter stands to his side.
SPLINTER	Together. The lobby has changed. Shots establishing the jury-rigged - The large Aztec-like calendar on the lobby floor suddenly The disk in the basement is suddenly RAISED up to the lobby - Finally, Winters' office elevator LOWERS from high above. PUSH IN on one cell, as Leo sits hunched over, unconscious Quick shots of April and Casey gearing up. Casey with his off- They both emerge from their rooms, dressed to kill. Casey's

CASEY	No way...
APRIL	I was saving it for our anniversary. Thanks. Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss
APRIL	That's our ride. nd on Raph in passenger seat and Mikey driving.
RAPHAEL	You know I ain't much on speeches. But we can do this. Leo, or no Leo. Not because of our individual strengths... but because of how we function as a team.
ICHAELANGELO	I love you man.
RAPHAEL	Don't push it. April, this is going to be dangerous. You sure you're in?
APRIL	I feel responsible, fellas. I found the Generals for him.

APHAEL (O.S.)	Nice an' incognito there, Mikey.
MICHAELANGELO (O.S.)	Well, I didn't see you offering any suggestions... besides- - a true ninja can hide in plain sight, my son! I heard that! Van takes off as the CAMERA SLOWS in the street, watching it

CASEY	Yeah, hey, I was supposed to drop this off for Mr. Winters. If I don't get this done, I am majorly in the doghouse. You know what I'm sayin', right? Right? The two stare at each other as the CAM ANGLES BEHIND KARAI -
KARAI	Please come in, then.
CASEY	Really!? I mean, "but of course". Casey wheels the crate inside. The gate closes only KARAI HAS
APHAEL	Let's NEVER do this again. And who did that?!
MICHAELANGELO	What?! Why does everyone always call ME out? A long beat. Then...
SPLINTER	I apologize my sons. Everyone looks at sheepish Splinter. A beat. Suddenly- KARAI makes a dramatic entrance, landing in front of April
CASEY	I suppose this is where we all take out our sharp and pointy things?
KARAI	You suppose correctly.

RAPHAEL	PUSH IN - it's LEO. He's slowly waking up - groggy. Muttering -CLUNK! She wobbles and then passes out. When Karai falls out
APRIL	I had the situation under control. You're welcome. Mikey fights the most like Jackie Chan - comical maneuvers
APRIL	Guys! Front door is open. Now! They all charge the front door! Winters is happy. He looks up to the heavens. Checks a time PACE - The final star drifts into position. A LIGHT BURST POV OFFICE ABOVE - Each of the Thirteen Cells LIGHT UP to
WINTERS	Finally... finally! ON GENERALS - they're still. Emotionless. The light sequence gets to Leo's cell... it doesn't light up.
WINTERS	What? His mind reels. Looks down at the cells. Nothing. Then it
WINTERS	What did you do?!
MICHAELANGELO	What do we do, dudes?!
DONATELLO	I'm working on it. Raph grips his sais with renewed strength. Casey looks
RAPHAEL	We get ready for round two. ON CASEY IN CORNER - He reaches into his back, takes out a The Ninjas are locked out!
RAPHAEL	Yeah! Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles.
APRIL	Nice work, Jones.
CASEY	I have my moments...
DONATELLO	Look! OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the
DONATELLO	And that would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume. Cool. They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell.
MICHAELANGELO	Leo! Is that you? RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way.
MICHAELANGELO	I guess that would be a "no". ON RAPH - He finds Leo!
DONATELLO	Out of the way, please.
D	on places a small EXPLOSIVE on a key lock. Raph pulls Leo
RAPHAEL	Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo, please wake up! Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is
LEONARDO (O.S.)	Wh-wh-what took you s-so long? WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength
RAPHAEL	Listen, I - I'm sorry. ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the window of his ..just misses it. WHUMP! He crashes onto the floor. ON GROUP - They just stare at him. Back up to the office, ON BALCONY ABOVE - Aguila looks down. Snarls.
CASEY	Is he... is he dead? Mikey takes out a hockey stick from Casey's bag and pokes
MICHAELANGELO	Yup. He's WAY dead, dude. WINTERS GASPS FOR AIR! Startles everyone in the room. Raph can't take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts
WINTERS	Fascinating...
SPLINTER	Mister Winters. We mean you no harm.
RAPHAEL	No harm?! Whatever! I'm about to give you piercin's in places you never imagined if you don't tell us what's going on.
O	
WINTERS	We were so close... so close. Winters collapses on the floor. Head in hands.
WINTERS	This was our chance. We could have changed it all.
APRIL	We know everything Max. We know you're trying to recreate what Yaotl started 3000 years ago. N WINTERS - He looks up. Sees April. Exhausted, as we- The same red-tinted battlefield we left in Winter's There are things, Miss O'Neil, no one could possibly know... Camera pushes in on YAOTL and his Four Generals high on a ON YAOTL - He takes off his helmet... IT'S WINTERS HIMSELF.
WINTERS (V.O.)	It was I who stood on that battlefield all those years ago. Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a
WINTERS (V.O.)	And we had to pay a price. The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They
WINTERS (V.O.)	We were cursed that day. My four comrades-in-arms were turned into stone.
B	Cursed to live on this Earth... immobile... yet fully aware at all times to ponder the crimes we've committed. ON WINTERS - He stands on the battlefield. Alone. As he
WINTERS (V.O.)	My curse was to live... forever. To feel the pain of losing love time and time again. Of boredom. The pain... of time. ACK IN PRESENT DAY. Winters stops walking...
WINTERS	We were doomed to live this way until, as the Shaman put it, "you corrected the mistakes of your past". That's what this is about. Penance, Miss O'Neil. Finally getting a chance to right our wrongs. Our master fails to include crucial points in his tale. ON SHADOWS - The Four Generals thump forward.
GENERAL AGUILA	He fails to discuss the petrified agony of three thousand years.
GENERAL SERPIENTE	Of the torture of taking CENTURIES to merely blink an eye!
GENERAL GATO	Of watching the erosion of your own body throughout centuries.
GENERAL AGUILA	So, while our great leader basked in the warmth of the sun and the glory of fresh air... we rotted in the stone hell that lasted throughout Wmillennia.
INTERS	My brothers, I-
GENERAL AGUILA	WE ARE NO BROTHERS TO YOU! Our brotherhood was broken the day that you condemned us to this eternity.
GENERAL GATO	And now, our Master has tired of feeding on the nectar of life. Of loving his entire life. Of FEELING. So he prefers to end it all. End HIS "misery" at the expense of ours. Aguila walks to the cells. The portal writhes in the bg,
GENERAL AGUILA	But thanks to his cunning, his technology, we are now capable of LIVING... we have now become- - gods.
GENERAL SERPIENTE	And we shall finish what we began all those years ago. We will finally have our victory.
GENERAL GATO	Even with one monster still free, the curse can never be broken!
GENERAL AGUILA	Join us. Join us Yaotl, and live a life eternal with us at your side! ON WINTERS - He waits. A beat.
WINTERS	Never. This was our opportunity! We were wrong! Don't you understand?! And you are weak.
GENERAL AGUILA	Destroy them. Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the What does THAT mean?
KARAI	It means we're going to help you. WIDER - 40 Foot Ninja disperse around out of the building,
KARAI	My soldiers will find the thirteenth monster. And you will bring it back here. Hurry - we don't have much time. Karai runs off. April looks over at Winters. He nods, still
CASEY	I got shotgun! BACK ON GENERALS - They move toward Winters! The Turtles Aguila moves forward to Leo. Raph steps in beside him,
RAPHAEL	If you mess with one of us- -you mess with all of us. Aguila smiles at their chutzpa.
GENERAL AGUILA	Challenge accepted. 97 The Portal worsens behind them. Sound and sight. The Eight 97 ...and the fight BEGINS! The Turtles leap, pounce and strike Suddenly a WALKING STICK across his chest stops him!
SPLINTER	They must face them alone. As brothers. Winters debates it in his head for a beat - WHAM! - a
WINTERS	Alright. We have more important things to do! ON PORTAL - A small DEMON makes its way out of the portal!
WINTERS	Help me push the cells into the portal! Splinter does as the two masters also manage to lay some This has got to be the suckiest vehicle to save the world with. - as the Cowabunga Carl van roars around the corner. Tinkling INSIDE VAN - Casey drives, as April, Karai and Four Foot are
CASEY	So... anybody from out of town? LOBBY - The combatants all pair off for their final battle.
LEONARDO	Come to daddy. MOMENTS LATER - SMASH! - Leo steps out, ready for action. Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS.
RAPHAEL	Sensei! How you guys doing?! ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in.
SPLINTER	Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL! BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC.
KARAI	My troops have located the final monster. At the harbor docks.
ASEY	Oh, I got this one covered. Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD - the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE. NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas look at
ASEY	Huh. Now there's somethin' you don't see every day... They pile out of the van.
CASEY	Well, I guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to Winters' Tower.
KARAI	We should tie it to the van and drag it back.
CASEY	Wow. You're... hard core. ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body.
CASEY	Incoming! ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away! BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.
LEONARDO	They better hurry with that last monster!
RAPHAEL	I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control...
LEONARDO	That's what I'm afraid of. BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE
APRIL	What are you doing in here?!
CASEY	Ran outta food. They all look out the back window as the creature pounds BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill.
APHAEL	Listen. I'm the last guy to sound like a TV cartoon, but I think we need to work together.
MICHAELANGELO	Teamwork. The more you know... Don clocks Mikey behind the head. Why Raph, no solo act tonight? Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM. ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as
SPLINTER	Yes. Yes, my sons. The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a
RAPHAEL	So who wants ta call it a day?
LEONARDO	I'm in.
DONATELLO	Affirmative.
MICHAELANGELO	Roger dodger, dude. The TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.
SPLINTER	My sons, I am so proud of you all. Then - BOOM! - the Generals' ARMS slam onto the ridge of the
GENERAL AGUILA	Silly children. We are immortals made of stone! The Earth has only BEGUN to feel our wrath! The brothers are screwed. They can't stop the Generals. Until- he Creature tries to stop, but can't on the marble floor. It Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle. Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal. WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!
RAPHAEL	I thought he'd never shut up. WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.
YEAH! WHOOHOO! WE DID IT!	The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud.
CASEY	Oh. I, uh - HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks.
APRIL	Don't try to tell me for one second that you didn't enjoy tha- Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and
KARAI	You are every bit the warriors I was informed you were. You have passed. ON TMNT - they're confused.
LEONARDO	Passed what?
RAPHAEL	You know us?
KARAI	I've known OF you for some time. Savor your victory tonight. For soon we will have further business together.
SPLINTER	What kind of business?
KARAI	The kind that involves familiar faces from your past... ON TURTLES - They all look at each other.
RAPHAEL	She doesn't mean... They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED.
RAPHAEL	Winters? ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned. own BLOOD from a cut on his cheek.
ICHAELANGELO	I'm never usually that happy to be bleeding.
DONATELLO	You would be if you were an immortal who couldn't bleed for three thousand years... Winters looks at all the Turtles.
WINTERS	Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You've made a very old man, very very happy.
MICHAELANGELO	So, um, what happens now?
MICHAELANGELO	Okay... just a little bit creepy. Oh gawd. I think he's in my n-n- CAM PULLS BACK, out of the building, onto the street. See the Raph comes to Splinter's room.
APHAEL	You wanted to see me Sensei?
SPLINTER	Sit down, Raphael.
RAPHAEL	Thank you, Master Splinter, for your guidance. I can only hope that one day, I will be able to begin the next stage of my training like Leo. Splinter smiles. Reaches into a box and takes out a similar
SPLINTER	That, my son, you already have. Our training works in mysterious ways. But the answer that lies in all our questions... is family. Raph beams as he accepts the "badge". He excitedly stands up. A ROCKIN' NUMBER PLAYS as we cap everyone's adventures.
L	
PLINTER	Ahh. Double chocolate fudge.
RAPHAEL	So we're cool with the whole Nightwatcher thing?
LEONARDO	Yeah, we're cool. Our secret, bro. You got rid of the stuff, right? QUICK SHOT - Nightwatcher's gear burning in a barrel.
EONARDO	What about the bike, tho?
RAPHAEL	Okay, so I couldn't exactly destroy the bike. Let's just say it's in good hands.
LEONARDO	What do you mean?
RAPHAEL	I mean, it's in good hands.
LEONARDO	Oh, you didn't. Raph sheepishly shrugs as we- As Casey roars down the street on the black motorcycle of He drives past WINTERS TOWER - now being converted to a
APRIL	...yes. She wraps her arms around his waist and holds tight for the CAM FOLLOWS for a beat, then rises up the buildings to- All four turtles are horsing around. They get geared up... The boys run, hoot and holler as they fly high on the
RAPHAEL (V.O.)	So what makes a family? Personally, it's more than sharing a roof or a bathroom. It's sharing life... My father taught me that, and I think it's pretty much true... y'know, provided that you don't kill each other in the process. Or that no one touches your stuff. Or makes loud noises when you're trying to sleep. Or...
RAPHAEL (V.O.)	Hey, nobody said it was easy.
