CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
GIRL	Now that the war's over, our soldiers get to come home, yes?
TEACHER	Some of them. Some will be stationed on the rim planets as Peace Enforcers.
BOY	I don't understand. Why were the Independents even fighting us? Why wouldn't they look to be more civilized?
TEACHER	That's a good question. Does anybody want to open on that?
GIRL	I hear they're cannibals.
ANOTHER BOY	That's only Reavers.
ANOTHER GIRL	Reavers aren't real.
ANOTHER BOY	Full well they are. They attack settlers from space, they kill them and wear their skins and rape them for hours and hours --
TEACHER	It's true that there are... dangers on the outer planets. So let's follow up on Borodin's question. With all the social and medical advancements we can bring to the Independents, why would they fight so hard against us?
RIVER	We meddle.
TEACHER	River? RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
RIVER	People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do, what to think, don't run don't walk we're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right. We're meddlesome.
TEACHER	River, we're not telling people what to think. We're just trying to show them how. She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead
2ND TECHNICIAN	She's dreaming.
FIRST TECHNICIAN	Nightmare?
2ND TECHNICIAN	Off the charts. Scary monsters.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight- drop. DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton See, most of our best work is done when they're asleep. We can monitor and direct their subconscious, implant suggestions... River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector It's a little startling to see, but the results are spectacular. Especially in this case. River Tam is our star pupil. The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
SIMON	I've heard that.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	She's a genius. Her mental capacity is extraordinary, even with the side-effects.
SIMON	Tell me about them.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Well, obviously, she's unstable... the neural stripping gives them heightened cognitive reception, but it also destabilizes their own reality matrix. It manifests as borderline schizophrenia... which at this point is the price for being truly psychic.
SIMON	What use do we have for a psychic if she's insane?
DOCTOR MATHIAS	I don't have to tell you the security potential of someone who can read minds. And she has lucid periods -- we hope to improve upon the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to ask if there's some reason for this inspection. Am I making you nervous?
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Key members of Parliament have personally observed this subject. I was told their support for the project was unanimous. The demonstration of her power --
SIMON	How is she physically?
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Like nothing we've seen. All our subjects are conditioned for combat, but River... she's a creature of extraordinary grace.
SIMON	Yes. She always did love to dance. He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor. As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade), River. Wake up. Please, it's Simon. River. It's your brother. Wake up... She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.
RIVER	Simon. A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion. They know you've come.
SIMON	We can't make it to the surface from inside. Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at 4wo SIMON Find a -- But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
SIMON	Get on! He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)	Stop. The action freezes. Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack. The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon f t o Stop. There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
THE OPERATIVE	Biograph. Simon Tam. As Simon's history files down in print and pictures -- Remarkable children. Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Excuse me! No one is allowed in the records room without my express permission.
THE OPERATIVE	Enter the doctor. Forgive me. I prefer to see the event alone, without bias. Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	I need to see your clearance.
THE OPERATIVE	You're right to insist. I know you've had security issues here. He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Apologies. An Operative of the Parliament will of course have full cooperation. I'm not sure what... I see no listing of rank, or name.
THE OPERATIVE	I have neither. Like this facility, I don't exist. The Parliament calls me in when... when they wish they didn't have to. Let's talk about the Tams.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	I assume you've scanned the status logs...
THE OPERATIVE	River was your greatest success. A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until her brother walked in eight months ago and took her from you.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	It's not quite so simple.
THE OPERATIVE	I'm very aware of that.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	He came in with full creds. He beat the ap-scan, the retinal... There was no way I could --
THE OPERATIVE	No, no. Of course. The boy spent his fortune developing the contacts to infiltrate this place.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Gave up a brilliant future in. medicine as well, you've probably read. Turned his back on his whole life. Madness.
THE OPERATIVE	Madness, no. Something a good deal more dangerous. Have you looked at this scan carefully? At his face? Mathias looks uncertain. It's love, in point of fact. He loved his sister and he knew she was in pain. So he took her somewhere safe.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Why are you here?
THE OPERATIVE	I'm here because the situation is even less simple than you think. Do you know what your sin is, Doctor?
DOCTOR MATHIAS	I. I would be very careful about what you -- It's pride. He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Key members of Parliament have personally observed this subject. I was told their support --
THE OPERATIVE	Key members of Parliament. Key. The minds behind every diplomatic, military and covert operation in the galaxy, and you put them in a room with a psychic.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	She was... she read cards, nothing more.
THE OPERATIVE	It's come to our attention that River became much more unstable, more... disturbed, after you showed her off to Parliament. Did she see something very terrible in those cards?
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Whatever... secrets she might have accidentally gleaned... it's probable she doesn't even know she knows them. That they're buried beneath --
THE OPERATIVE	But they are in her. Her mind is unquiet. It's the will of the Parliament that I kill her. And the brother. Because of your sin.
THE OPERATIVE	You know, in certain older civilized cultures, when men failed as entirely as you have, they would throw themselves on their swords.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	Well, unfortunately I forgot to bring a sword to -- The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.
THE OPERATIVE	The Parliament has no further interest in psychics. They represent a threat to the harmony and stability of our Alliance.
DOCTOR MATHIAS	I would put that down right now if I were you.
THE OPERATIVE	Would you be killed in your sleep, like an ailing pet? Whatever your failings, I believe you deserve better than that. The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He Young miss, I'll need all the logs- on behavioral modification triggers. We'll have to reach out to River Tam, and help her to come back to us. No matter how far out Simon has taken her, we can -- He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame, This is a good death. There's no shame in this, in a man's death. A man who's done fine works. We're making a better world. All of them, better worlds. Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the Young miss, I need you to get to work now. I think I may have a long way to travel. She goes. He approaches River, very close, staring... Where are you hiding,,little girl? The noise is sucked suddenly out of the room as we black out. becomes the name painted on the side of a spaceship, with The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
MAL	What was that? He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian
WASH	Whoah! Did you see that -- The ship bucks --
MAL	Was that the primary buffer panel? It did seem to resemble --
MAL	Did the Primary Buffer Panel just fall off my gorramn ship for no apparent reason? Another buck --
WASH	Looks like.
MAL	I thought Kaylee checked our entry couplings! I have a very clear memory of it --
WASH	Yeah well if she doesn't give us some extra flow from the engine room to offset the burnthrough this landing is gonna get pretty interesting.
MAL	Define "Interesting".
WASH	"Oh god, oh god, we're all gonna die?"
MAL	This is the Captain. There's a little problem with our entry sequence; we may experience slight turbulence and then explode. Can you shave the vector --
WASH	I'm doing it! It's not enough. Kaylee!
MAL	Just get us on the ground!
WASH	That part'll happen, pretty definitely.
JAYNE	we're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode.
MAL	Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing? You only got the two arms...
JAYNE	I just get excitable as to choice, like to have my options open.
MAL	I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job.
JAYNE	Well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar.
MAL	No grenades. No grenades. First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of
ZOE	Are we crashing again?
MAL	Talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped?
ZOE	Good to go, sir. Just loading her up. Are those grenades?
JAYNE	Cap'n doesn't want 'em.
ZOE	We're robbing the place. We're not occupying it. All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the:
MAL	Kaylee! He enters:
MAL	Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine We got the Primary Buffer
KAYLEE	Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret.
MAL	You told me -- You told me the entry couplings would hold for another week! That was six months ago, cap'n.
MAL	My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her. Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up. Doctor. Guess I need to get innocked 'fore we hit planetside. Simon nods, the ship jolting again. Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to worry about.
SIMON	I'm not worried.
MAL	Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc.
SIMON	This isn't fear. This is anger. Well, it's kinda hard to tell the one from t'other, face like yours.
SIMON	I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider.
MAL	I'll look for that next time.
SIMON	You're not taking her.
MAL	No no, that's not a thing I'm interested in talking over with --
SIMON	She's not going with you. That's final.
MAL	I hear the words "that's final" come out of your mouth ever again, they truly will be. This is my boat. Y'all are guests on it. He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:
SIMON	Guests? I earn my passage, Captain --
MAL	And it's time your little sister learned from your fine example.
SIMON	I've earned my passage treating bullet holes, knife wounds, laser burns...
MAL	Some of our jobs are trickier than others --
SIMON	And you want to put my sister in the middle of that.
MAL	Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'. It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine. The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the
SIMON	She's a seventeen year old girl. A mentally traumatized sevente--
MAL	She's a reader. Sees into the truth of things; might see trouble before it's coming. Which is of use to me.
SIMON	And that's your guiding star, isn't it? What's of use. Honestly, doctor, I think we may really crash this time anyway. Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm.
SIMON	Do you understand what I've gone through to keep River away from the Alliance?
MAL	I do, and it's a fact me and mine have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves.
SIMON	Are you threatening to --
MAL	I got one purpose here: keep this boat in the air. I take the jobs I get -- which is less and less, case you ain't been keeping track. He starts away, Simon still keeping pace. Every year since the war the Alliance pushes just a little further out towards the rim. Makes it a chore for naughty men like us to slip about -- and keeping you two on board means working twice as hard to avoid the law. Means turning down a score of honest jobs.
MAL	So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you. Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him: Things get gritty I will keep her from the fray, but she's coming. Best you get her ready. As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this boat out before we get flattened?
ZOE	Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody flies like my mister. The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
SIMON	River... She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
RIVER	I know. We're going for a ride.
SIMON	Now, River, you stay behind the others. If there's fighting you drop to the floor or run away. It's okay to leave them to die. River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.
RIVER	I'm the brains of the operation.
ZOE	We should hit town right during Sunday worship. Won't be any crowds.
MAL	If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll, this could look to be a sunny day for us. Captain, I'll ask you one last time...
MAL	Doctor, I'm taking your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to you I will get very choked up. Honestly. There could be tears. He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...
KAYLEE	Don't mind the Captain none, Simon. I know he'll look out for her.
SIMON	It's amazing. I bring River all the way out to the raggedy edge of the 'verse so she can hide from the Alliance by robbing banks.
KAYLEE	It's just a little Trading Station. They'll be back 'fore you can spit. Not that you spit... Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn.
JAYNE	What are we hoping to find here that equals the worth of a turd?
MAL	Alliance payroll. There's peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant. Can't use credits out here -- they got to pay their boys in cashy money. Which once a month rests here.
ZOE	Something about stealing from the Alliance just warms a body like whiskey in winter.
JAYNE	Shiny. Let's be badguys. Mal turns back to River.
MAL	You ready to go to work, darlin'?
RIVER	There's no pattern to the pebbles here, they're completely random. I tried to count them but you drove too fast. Hummingbird.
MAL	Right. Great. Let's go. The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
MAL	Hands and knees and heads bowed down! Everybody, now! Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others. The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a Y'all wanna be looking very intently at your own belly buttons. I see a head start to rise, violence is gonna ensue. The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
JAYNE	Looks like this is the place. He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
MAL	You've probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we are after is not yours. So let's have no undue fussing. As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
JAYNE	She's locked up. River suddenly looks around, perturbed. CLOSE ON: a young tough. River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
ZOE	You know what the definition of a hero is? It's someone who gets other people killed. You can look it up later. He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
TRADE AGENT	This is just a crop moon, don't think you'll find what you --
MAL	The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
ZOE	At last. We can retire and give up this life of crime. Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
MAL	Is there a fed down there? Be truthful. Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought for independence?
MAL	War's long done. We're all just folk now. Listen up! We are coming down to empty that vault! The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.
GUARD (O.S.)	You have to give me your authorization password! Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into Okay... Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:
SON	Repeater.
WOMAN	Did sound summat like gunblast... Maybe you aught run tell Lawman... She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man.
JAYNE	What the hell is up? You all right? What's goin' on? He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed...
RIVER	Reavers.
MAL	Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary organs...
GUARD	I was thinking more of a graze..
MAL	Well you don't want it to look like you just gave up...
MAL	Every heist, he's gotta start yelling my name --
JAYNE	Mal! Reavers! The girl's pitchin' a fit. They're here or they're comin' soon. He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly.
MAL	Get on the mule. Does that open from the inside?
GUARD	Whah -ah- yes...
MAL	You get everyone upstairs in there and you seal it. Long as you got air you don't open up, you understand?
GUARD	I -- Buh I -- Mal is in his face, dark and huge:
MAL	Zoe take the wheel --
JAYNE	You see 'em? Anybody see 'em? 1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
YOUNG MAN	Take me with you!
MAL	Get in the vault with the others --
YOUNG MAN	I can't stay here! Please!
MAL	It's too many. Drive, Zoe. A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
MAL	Drive! Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
JAYNE	How come they ain't blowing us out of the air?
MAL	They wanna run us down. The up- close kill. River is squashed down on her back, being very small.
RIVER	They want us alive when they eat us.
JAYNE	Boy, sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don'tchya think? Mal says nothing, keeps firing.
ZOE	Wash, baby can you hear me?
WASH	We're moments from air. You got somebody behind you? We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:
ZOE	Reavers.
ZOE	We're not gonna reach you in time.
WASH	Just keep moving, honey. We're coming to you. Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing
MAL	Grab on! Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the
JAYNE	I won't get et! You shoot me if they take me! Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne -- Well don't shoot me first! Mal fires. Again. Steadies himself for one more...
V0V	The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground. Mal Rutting pigs! Where's -- And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it.
WASH	Get some distance on 'em. You come to the flats, I want you to swing round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.
WASH	J Simon! Open the loading dock! Okay, baby, we've talked this through...
ZOE	Talkin' ain't doin'. She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about, Don't slow down!
ANGLE: THE SKIFF	As it heads for the mule -- As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
SIMON	River?
RIVER	I swallowed a bug. Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is. She goes to Simon.
KAYLEE	Are you okay?
MAL	Is he okay? A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top. We all here? What's going on? Hello? r./ ZOE No casualties. Anybody following?
WASH	Nice flying, baby, and that's a negative. Clean getaway -- Out of atmo in six minutes.
MAL	Set course for Beaumonde. First thing, I want these bod -- Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to
SIMON	You stupid, selfish, son of a whore ---
MAL	I'm a hair's breadth from riddling you with holes, Doctor --
SIMON	"One simple job! She'll be fine!"
MAL	She IS fine! Except for bein' still crazy, she's the picture of health!
ZOE	Wasn't for River, we'd probably be left there. She felt 'em coming.
SIMON	Never again. You understand me?
MAL	Seems I remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat.
SIMON	Well sleep easy 'cause we're off your boat. Just as soon as River gets her share of the "bounty".
KAYLEE	Well let's not do anything hasty...
MAL	No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying tourists anyhow. We'll be on Beaumonde in ten hours time, you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry. Meantime you do your job. Patch up my crew. A beat.
RIVER	He didn't lie down. They never lie down. She is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment.
ZOE	No, I think things'll glide a deal smoother for us without River and Simon on board... but how long do you think they'll last?
MAL	Doc made his call. They's as babes in a basket when we took 'em in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man has to cut loose, learn to stand on his own.
ZOE	Like that man back in town? They stop by Mal Is room.
MAL	I had to shoot him. What the Reavers woulda done to him before they killed him...
ZOE	I know. That was a piece a' mercy. But before that, him begging us to bring him along... vo,
MAL	We couldn't take the weight. Woulda slowed us down.
ZOE	You know that for certain
MAL	Mule won't run with five. I shoulda dumped the girl? Or you? Or Jayne? Well, Jayne...
ZOE	Coulda tossed the payload.
MAL	And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our mitts, tell 'em "here's your share"? They'd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril. We get a job, we gotta vo make good. Washenters from the bridge.
ZOE	Sir, I don't disagree on any particular point, it's just... in the time of war, we woulda never left a man stranded.
MAL	Maybe that's why we lost. She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and Mal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides
INARA	Kaylee, are you ever gonna put that capture down?
KAYLEE (0.5.)	We gotta have records of everything. A bona fide Companion entertained clients on this very ship! In this very bed! The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending For one sweet second, we was almost classy.
INARA	4 You promised to help me pack. Honest, Inara, why do you have to leave? Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
JAYNE (V.0.)	I do not get it. How's a guy get so wrong?
JAYNE	Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own face, rapin' and murdering -- I mean, I'll kill a man in a fair fight... or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight, or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman, or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only when I'm gettin' paid. But these Reavers... last ten years they just show up like the boageyman from stories. Eating people alive? Where does that get fun? He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing.
KAYLEE	Shepherd Book said they was men that reached the edge of space., saw a vasty nothingness and just went bibbledy over it.
JAYNE	Hell, I been to the edge. Just looked like more space.
KAYLEE	I don't know. People get awful lonely in the black. Like to get addlepated ourselves, we stay on this boat much longer. Captain'll drive us all off, one by one.
JAYNE	You're just in a whinge cuz that prissy doc is finally disembarking. Me I says good riddance. He never belonged here, and his sister's no saner than one of them Reavers.
KAYLEE	That ain't even so! River's a dear heart and a boon to this crew! You just don't like her 'cause she can read your mind and everything you think is mean.
JAYNE	Well, there is that.
KAYLEE	Her and Simon could have a place here. Now they're leaving us. Just like Shepherd Book. She looks up toward one of the shuttles. Just like Inara...
A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)	They love you.
SHEYDRA	The girls. They've learned more from you these last months than the rest of us could show them in two years.
INARA	They're very sweet. But they're not Companions. You've no hope for them? Junk the lot, start anew?
INARA	On Sihnon we started training at twelve. Years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure was even mentioned. Most of these girls --
SHEYDRA	They're all of good family, the highest academic standards --
INARA	Control. Was the first lesson. And the last and these worlds are not like the Central Planets. There is barbarism dressed up in the most civil weeds. Men of the highest rank who don't know the difference between a Companion and a common whore. It's unsafe.
SHEYDRA	All the more reason the girls look to you. You came out here alone, before the Alliance ever thought to establish a House this remote. You've seen so much. You're a figure of great romance to them. 4d INARA Great romance has nothing to do with being a Companion, Sheydra. You should know better.
SHEYDRA	I'm not the one who had a torrid affair with a pirate. Inara nearly spills her drink.
INARA	A who? With a what? It's the talk of the House. The girls all trade stories in the dorms at night.
INARA	I didn't... have a pirate...
SHEYDRA	In one of the stories you make love in a burning temple. I think that's my favorite. This is unbearable. Captain Reynolds is no pirate; he's a petty thief. And he never laid a finger on me. All he ever did was rent me a shuttle and be very annoying. A year on his shuttle and he never laid a finger on you. No wonder you left. I left because -- go away. We're no longer friends. You're a stranger to me now.
SHEYDRA	104 I do love to watch you boil. Don't worry. The stories will fade. And your Captain Reynolds has probably gotten himself blown up by this time.
INARA	Yes. That would be just like him.
KAYLEE	Don't talk to the barkers -- only the captains. You look the captain in the eye, know who you're dealing with.
40 SIMON	â¢ I wish there was... Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on:
KAYLEE	You shouldn't aughta be so clean. It's a dead giveaway you don't belong, you always gotta be tidy. Don't pay anybody in advance. And don't ride in anything with a Capissen 38 engine, they fall right out of the sky.
SIMON	Kaylee. She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other River... do you want to stay with them?
4 RIVER	It's not safe.
SIMON	No, I fear it's not safe anymore. He's heading off and doesn't hear:
RIVER	For them.
NEWSPERSON (V.O.)	that it was a band of Reavers remains unconfirmed. The only survivors of the massacre apparently locked themselves in the Trade Station vault until -- During this we come around to see that the screen has a We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
MAL	It's not my fault the Doc's got no stomach for Rim living --
KAYLEE	It is entirely and for all your fault! If you'd given Simon a moment, just a moment where he didn't think you were gonna throw them off or turn them in, he might've --
MAL	What? Swept you into his cleanly arms? Made tidy love to you? They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
KAYLEE	Don't you dare joke! You know how much I pined on Simon. And him fair sweet on me, I well believe, but he's so worried about being found out --
ZOE	Captain didn't make 'em fugitives.
KAYLEE	But he coulda made 'em family! Steada driving them off. Steada keeping Simon from seein' I was there, when I carried such a torch and we coulda -- goin' on a year now I ain't had nothin' twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries!
MAL	Oh god! I can't know that!
JAYNE	40 I could stand to hear a little more...
KAYLEE	If you had a care for anybody's heart you woulda -- You knew he was gonna leave. We never been but a way station to those two. And how do you know what he feels? He's got River to worry on but he still coulda shown you... if I truly wanted someone bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in the 'verse could stop me from going to her.
KAYLEE	Tell that to Inara. For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.
MINGO	4 Domestic troubles? MINGO is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a
FANTY	Domestic troubles? FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is
MINGO	'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.
FANTY	A man should keep his house in order.
MAL	Mingo. Fanty.
MINGO	He's Mingo. ,do
MAL	He's Fanty. You're Mingo.
MINGO	Ghahh! How is it you always know?
MAL	Fanty's prettier. Feel to do some business?
MINGO	Bit crowded, isn't it? As you see, we come unencumbered by thugs.
MAL	Which means at least four of the guys already in here are yours. All's one. I'll just keep Jayne with me.
ZOE	Sir, are you sure you don't --
MAL	Go. Go get yourselves a nice romantic meal.
WASH	Those are my two favorite words! Honey... "Meal..."
MAL	It's business. We're fine. They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.
MINGO	Quite a crew you've got.
MAL	Yeah, they're a fine bunch of ruebens.
MINGO	How you keep them on that crap boat is the subject of much musing tween me and Fanty.
FANTY	We go on and on.
MAL	So I'm noticing. Is there a problem I don't know of? You got 25% of a sweet take kissing your foot, how come we're not dispersing?
FANTY	Our end is forty, precious.
JAYNE	My muscular buttocks it's forty --
MINGO	It is as of now. Find anyone around going cheaper.
J FANTY	Find anyone around going near a sorry lot like you in the first instance. ANGLE: RIVER has entered, is looking about. You're unlikable, Mal. You got no respect for us above you, you got enemies in every quadrant, and your ship's older than the starting point of time. You's charity cases to such as us.
MAL	Well here's a foul thought. I conjured you two were incompetent; sent us out not knowing there were V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking you picked us out because you did.
MINGO	That were a sign of faith, boy. And it doesn't affect our forty per. Danger is, after all, your business.
JAYNE	Reavers ain't business, double dickless. This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the We push in, the light from the CV on River's face, pushing to
RIVER	Miranda. She turns and looks back at the crowd. What happens next happens very fast. She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
MAL	River...
JAYNE	V0 Whuhuh? She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using Gorrammit, girl, it's me! She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
SIMON	Eta Kooram Nah Smech! And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
MAL	I think maybe we ought to leave. Hello again. Yes, it's me. I'm glad you've finally asked for me. An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor:
ENSIGN	We got a pos on a retinal -- man carrying her out is Malcolm Reynolds, captains a Firefly-class transport ship, "Serenity". Bound by law five times, smuggling, tariff dodge... not convicted. Nothing here that would --
THE OPERATIVE	The ship. The name of the ship.
10 (SOFTLY)	Crossref. Malcolm Reynolds. Serenity. He looks over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on
ENSIGN	Sir?
THE OPERATIVE	Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle of the entire war. The Independents held the valley for seven weeks, two of them after their high command had surrendered. 68% casualty rate.
ENSIGN	Of course, Sir, I just didn't --
THE OPERATIVE	There. His glasses stop scrolling and Mal's military file opens, a If the feds ever bothered to crossref justice files with war records... Yes. Our Mr. Reynolds was a sergeant, 57th Overlanders. Volunteer. Fought at Serenity till the very last. This man is an issue. This man hates us.
ENSIGN	First Mate Zoe Washburn, formerly Corporal Zoe Alleyne, also in the 57th. Career army, looks like.
THE OPERATIVE	She's followed him far... Give me the crew, registered passengers -- Our Captain is a passionate man, no room there for subtlety. He's bound to have some very obvious... CLOSE ON: THE LENS of his glasses. On it is a slowly moving
THE OPERATIVE	.weakness... Mal stares at her a moment, then:
SIMON	May I see her?
MAL	She's still napping just now. And I believe you've got some storytelling to do. We're out of atmo, plotted for Haven. No one following as of yet.
KAYLEE	Haven? We're gonna see Shepherd Book? We got to lay low. And I could fair use some spiritual guidance right about now. I am a lost lamb; what in hell happened back there?
WASH	Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety pound girl. 'Cause I don't think that's ever getting old.
ZOE	Do we know if anyone was killed?
MAL	It's likely. I know she meant to Ad kill me 'fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work anyhow?
SIMON	Safeword. The people who helped me break River out -- they had intel that River and the other subjects were being embedded with behavioral conditioning. They taught me a safeword, in case... something happened.
KAYLEE	Not sure I get it.
SIMON	A phrase that's encoded in her brain, that makes her fall asleep. If I speak the words, "Eta --
JAYNE	Well don't say it! moo ZOE It only works on her, Jayne.
JAYNE	Oh. Well, now I know that.
MAL	"In case something happened."
SIMON	What?
MAL	You feel to elaborate on what that something might be? I mean they taught you that fancy safeword, they must've figured she was gonna, what -- start uncontrollably crocheting?
SIMON	They never said what --
MAL	And you never did ask. Mal grabs him and throws him against the wall, in his face. Eight months. Eight months you had her on my boat knowing full well she might go monkeyshit at the wrong word and you never said a thing --
SIMON	I brought her out here so they couldn't get to her, I don't even know how they --
MAL	My ship. My crewi You had a gorramn timebomb living with us!
MAL	What if she went off in the middle woo of dinner, or in bunk with Kaylee, did that give you a moment's pause? Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him.
SIMON	I thought she was getting better.
JAYNE	And I thought they was gettin' off! Didn't we have a intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore?
KAYLEE	We couldn't leave them now...
JAYNE	No, now that she's a... killer woman we ought be bringin' 'em tea and dumplings! In earnest, Mal: why'd you bring her back on? Mal looks at Jayne, at all of them. Doesn't have an answer.
SIMON	May I see her. Mal steps aside. Simon enters the locker.
JAYNE	She goes woolly again, we're gonna have to put a bullet to her. It's crossed my mind.
WASH	Can I make a suggestion that doesn't involve violence, or is this the wrong crowd?
ZOE	Honey...
WASH	V0 Fanty and Mingo might be coming hard down on us, or the laws... or maybe nobody could be bunged about a little social brawl. We need to get our bearings. I think we need to talk to Mr. Universe. As he watches the security feed of River's fight his image
MR UNIVERSE	Oh, this is good. This is... .she's beating up all the burly men and I'm having a catharsis, it's happening right now, you guys always bring me the very best violence. You think you're in a hot place?
WASH	That's what we're looking to learn. Is there any follow up, a newswave...
MR UNIVERSE	There is no "news", there's the truth of the signal, what I see, and there's the puppet theatre the V0 Parliament's jesters foist on the somnambulant public. Monkey taught to say the word "monkey" -- lead story on 32 planets. But the slum riots on Hera, not a --
MAL	What about this? Did this make the... puppet theatre?
MR UNIVERSE	No sir. And no lawforce flags, either -- I hadda go into the security feed direct...
MAL	You can do that?
MR UNIVERSE	Can't stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere and I go everywhere. Security feeds are a traipse to access -- and I wasn't the first one in, this has prints on it -- oh! Look at her go! A0 Everyone is getting bruises and contusions. Contoooosions.
ZOE	So somebody else has been fed this. That doesn't like me too well.
MR UNIVERSE	Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling in love with me. You're just gonna embarrass yourself. I have a commitment to my Lovebot, it was a very beautiful ceremony, Lenore wrote her own vows, I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby. And she falls asleep. Which, she would be sleepy.
MAL	Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her 'fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her... Mr Universe works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on Miranda...? Go back further.
MR UNIVERSE	No.. He pulls another screen close, starts working that one.
MAL	Um... please? Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as well -- and it starts breaking down, bursts of
MR UNIVERSE	Friends and potential lovers, I
4DO	have good news and I have the other kind. Good is you're very smart. Someone is talking to her.
WASH	The oaty bar?
MAL	Subliminal. It's a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her. I been seeing this code pop up all over, last few weeks. And I cannot crack it. It's Alliance and it's high military, so here then is the bad. Someone has gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend. And found her they have. Mal, Zoe and Wash look at each other. Do you all know what it is you're carrying?
RIVER	They're afraid of me.
SIMON	I'm sorry...
RIVER	They should be. What I will show them... Oh God... She starts tearing up, breathing faster... Simon runs his
SIMON	It's okay, it's okay...
RIVER	Show me off like a dog, old men covered in blood, it never touched them but they're drowning in it... so much loss... I don't know what I'm saying. I never know what I'm saying...
SIMON	You said something. When you were triggered, do you remember? The Captain saw you say something on the feed...
RIVER	Miranda.
SIMON	Miranda.
RIVER	Ask her. She'll show you all.
SIMON	Show us what? Who is Miranda? Am I... talking to Miranda now? Nwï¿½ She shoots him a look.
RIVER	I'm not a multiple, dumbo.
SIMON	No. Right. But I think somehow when they triggered you it brought this up, this memory --
RIVER	It isn't mine. The memory. I didn't bring it and I shouldn't have to carry it, it isn't mine. Don't make me sleep again.
SIMON	I won't.
RIVER	Put a bullet to me. Bullet in the brain pan, squish.
SIMON	Don't say that. Not ever. We'll get through this. She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately.
RIVER	Things are going to get much much worse.
SIMON	Well, the Captain hasn't tossed us in the airlock, so I'd say we're --
RIVER	He has to see. More than anyone... he has to see what he doesn't want to.
SIMON	River. What will Miranda show us. She thinks.
RIVER	Death.
SIMON	Whose death? And she starts laughing. Quietly at first, then louder, then Black Silence.
BOOK (O.S.)	Lord, I am walking your way. ANGLE: THE RAMP lowers to reveal Shepherd BOOK, a working- Let me in, for my feet are sore, my clothes are ragged.
BOOK (O.S. )	Look in my eyes, Lord, and my sins will play out on them as on a screen. Read them all.
BOOK	Forgive what you can, and send me on my path. I will walk on, until you bid me rest.
MAL	Hope that ain't for me, Shepherd.
BOOK	It's prayer for the dead.
MAL	Then I really hope it ain't for me.
BOOK	It's for the men River might have killed in that bar.
MAL	Weren't River that did it, you know that. Somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take, fenced it right Vd up.
BOOK	You got a plan?
MAL	Hiding ain't a plan?
BOOK	It'll do you for a spell, and the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin...
MAL	.but they'll be coming. Alliance is after this girl with a powerful will. I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment.
BOOK	You won't. This isn't a palms-up military MW run, Mal. No reports broadwaved, no warrants... much as they want her, they want her hid. That means Closed File. Means an Operative, which is trouble you've not known.
MAL	I coulda left her there. I had an out -- hell, I had every reason in the 'verse to leave her lay and haul anchor.
BOOK	Not your way, Mal.
V0 MAL	I have a way? Is that better than a plan?
BOOK	You can play the thug all you want, but there's more to you than you're ever like to 'fess.
MAL	You just think that 'cause my eyes is all sorrowful and pretty.
BOOK	Only one thing is gonna walk you through this, Mal. Belief.
MAL	Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd. I ain't looking for help from on high. That's a long wait for a train don't come.
BOOK	When I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God? They'll come at you sideways. As he continues, we see: The operative comes slowly up the staircase, stands before
BOOK W. (V.0.)	It's how they think: sideways. It's how they move. Sidle up and smile, hit you where you're weak.
BOOK	Sorta man they're like to send believes hard. Kills and never asks why.
MAL	It's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world.
BOOK	I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal.
MAL	Have to tell me about that some time.
BOOK	No I don't. He walks away, offering this: Sideways. Mal watches him go, thinking.
TEACHER	River? Eight-year-old River is working away, not paying attention. River, you look tired. I think everybody's a little tired by now; why don't we all lie down. River looks up, scared. All the other children wordlessly A little peace and quiet will make everything better. She starts to lie down herself, right on the grass.
RIVER	No... River. Do as you're told. It's going to be fine. Lie down.
MAL	Whuh huh nuhwhat?
WASH (0.S.)	Mal! You up? Got a wave. I'm a bounce it down to you. He pops up, turns to the screen as the white noise becomes:
MAL	Inara. REVERSE ON: Inara on Mal's screen. We see her from about Mal. I uh, is this a bad time
MAL	Good as any.
INARA	Please tell me you're wearing pants.
MAL	Naked as the day I come cryin'. How's your world?
INARA	Cold. It's autumn here.
MAL	Still at the Training House?
INARA	Right where you left me.
MAL	I remember it as nice enough. picturesque.
INARA	It is that. What about you? Still flying. So what occasi the wave? Not that to see you ain't... well you look very
watching both Mal and Inara on two	Zoe and Wash are secretly at their formal shyness. Jayne enters, wondering what's up...
INARA	Oh. Thank you, I... I guess we have something of a problem here. With the locals, I thought maybe...
MAL	You could use a gun hand?
INARA	I'm hoping not. But if you were close at all, you -- the crew -- could take your ease here a while... and there'd be payment...
MAL	Payment is never not a factor. I could sound out the crew... This pot like to boil over soon?
INARA	Soon. Not right away.
MAL	Well, it would be, I mean I would like to... Kaylee's been missing you something fierce --
KAYLEE	Oh they're so pathetic! I miss her too. I even miss my shuttle, occasionally.
MAL	Yeah, you left a... got some of your stuff in a trunk, never did get a chance to drop it off.
INARA	Oh.
MAL	I didn't look through the... stuff... just sundries I expect. Inara smiles blandly, nods. An awkward beat. Well, it's kind of late where I'm at. I'll send a wave as soon as I can.
INARA	Thank you. She disappears. Mal thinks a moment.
WASH	Inara. Nice to see her again.
ZOE	So, trap?
MAL	Trap.
ZOE	We goin' in? moo MAL It ain't but a few hours out...
WASH	Yeah, but, remember the part where it's a trap?
MAL	If that's the case, then Inara's already caught in it. She wouldn't set us up willing. Might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels. We go in.
KAYLEE	How can you be sure Inara don't just wanna see you? Sometimes people have feelings -- I'm referring here to people...
MAL	Y'all were watching, I take it. Guilty glances.
KAYLEE	Yes.
MAL	140 You see us fight?
KAYLEE	No.
MAL	Trap.
WASH	We're about seventy miles from the Training house. And nobody on radar... if the Alliance is about, they're laying low.
MAL	They're about. Find us a home. I'll take the shuttle in closer. Zoe, ship is yours. 4dO He starts out, turns back to Zoe. Remember: if anything happens to me, or you don't hear from me within the hour... you take this ship and you come and rescue me.
ZOE	What? And risk my ship? I mean it. It's cold out there. I don't wanna get left. The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle
MAL	Dear Buddha, please send me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and --
I NAR.A	Mal! What are you doing here?
MAL	You invited me.
INARA	I never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come!
MAL	Well that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it?
INARA	You knew my invitation wasn't on the level --
MAL	Which led me to the conclusion that you must be in some trouble.
INARA	I'm fine! I'm. giddy.
MAL	For a woman schooled in telling men what they wanna hear, you ain't much of a liar.
INARA	Mal, you cannot handle this man. I have to say, I'm impressed that you would come for her yourself. lwï¿½ And that you would make it this far in that outfit. I can be very graceful when I need to.
THE OPERATIVE	I've no doubt. Mal sheds his shawl and robe. Inara kneels at the alter,
MAL	What are you doing?
INARA	I'm praying for you, Mal.
THE OPERATIVE	That's very thoughtful. But I mean it when I say you're not in any danger.
MAL	Speak your piece.
THE OPERATIVE	I think you're beginning to understand how dangerous River Tam is.
MAL	She is a mite unpredictable. Mood swings, of a sort.
THE OPERATIVE	It's worse than you know.
MAL	It usually is.
THE OPERATIVE	That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. She's an albatross, Captain.
MAL	Way I remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck... til some idiot killed it. Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint. The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he
THE OPERATIVE	I've seen your war record. I know how you must feel about the Alliance.
MAL	You really don't.
THE OPERATIVE	Fair to say. But I have to hope you understand you can't beat us.
MAL	I got no need to beat you. I just wanna go my way.
THE OPERATIVE	And you can do that, once you let me take the girl back home. Give me the opportunity to help you.
MAL	All I gotta do is let you take one more thing away from me. I've had a lot of things taken in my time. And it may just be that this is one too many.
THE OPERATIVE	This psychotic, potentially murderous girl who can't have the slightest awareness of your protection. This is where you "draw the line".
MAL	Well I'm a whimsical soul.
THE OPERATIVE	There's a number of lives that hang in the balance here. Lives under your care. Are they as whimsical as yourself?
MAL	I got no notion that I'm being heroical at all. Any more than I think you're really just a harmless bureaucrat come to help me out. You move like a killer. The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:
THE OPERATIVE	I have a warship in deep orbit, Captain. We locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo. I can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location inside of three minutes. Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
MAL	You do that, best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord.
THE OPERATIVE	Pulse beacon.
MAL	Advice from an old tracker: you J wanna find someone, use your eyes.
THE OPERATIVE	How long do you think you can really run from us?
MAL	Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I never credited the Alliance with an over-abundance of brains. And if you're the best they got...
THE OPERATIVE	Captain Reynolds, I should tell you so that you don't waste your time: You can't make me angry.
INARA	Oh please. Spend an hour with him. Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!"
THE OPERATIVE	I need her, Captain. River is... my purpose and I will gather her to me. The brother as well. Whatever else happens is incidental. In the greater scheme.
MAL	Why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great?
THE OPERATIVE	I want to resolve this like civilized men. I'm not threatening you. I'm unarmed.
MAL	Great! He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
THE OPERATIVE	I am of course wearing full body armor. I'm not a moron. He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
MAL	No back up? We're making an awful ruckus...
THE OPERATIVE	They'll come when they're needed.
MAL	I'd start whistling.
THE OPERATIVE	Captain, what do you think is going to happen here? They come at each other. The Operative is the much better Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out Nothing here is what it seems.
INARA	I know.
THE OPERATIVE	He's not the plucky hero. The Alliance isn't some evil empire. This isn't the grand arena.
INARA	And that's not incense. He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
THE OPERATIVE	Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!
MAL	.I had him...
INARA	What?
MAL	I think that I was winning! CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
ALLIANCE SOLDIER	Grenade! Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
INARA	Hang on to something.
MAL	4 You sure you remember how it -- He nearly falls over as:
INARA	I told you to hang on.
MAL (O.S. )	I'm fine... These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly
THE OPERATIVE	Forget the pulse beacon, there has to be another way to track the ship -- get a read on the nav sat. It's a registered transport, you must be able to locate -- Sir?
THE OPERATIVE	Have you found a nav sat trajectory? Sir... we've found seven. The Operative looks more unhappy than angry.
THE OPERATIVE	Does he think this is a game? She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see:
INARA (V.0.)	We have every reason to be afraid.
JAYNE	Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard --
MAL	He didn't beat me up --
INARA	Because he's a believer.
INARA (V.0.)	He's intelligent, methodical and devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do.
INARA	I honestly think the only reason we haven't been blown out of the air is that he needs to see her.
SIMON	Needs to see her why?
INARA	I'm uncertain. I would say to be sure of the kill, but... I just know he'll kill us all to get to her.
JAYNE	So no hope of a reward, huh?
ZOE	Did he mention a deal of any kind?
MAL	Give the two of them up. Go my way.
JAYNE	Which you was all ready to do not a day ago. What went sour?
MAL	Cutting them loose ain't the same as handing them over.
JAYNE	That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm about to become is having trouble telling the difference.
SIMON	Did he say anything about a "Miranda"?
INARA	What is that?
MAL	Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind. Conjure it might be the reason he's after her.
INARA	You think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance?
WASH	Do we care? Are we caring about that?
JAYNE	You dumbass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is us on this boat!
MAL	Look, we get back to Haven in a 'r/ few hours time --
JAYNE	Hiding under the Shepherd's skirts, that's a manful scheme --
MAL	You wanna run this ship?
JAYNE	Yes!
MAL	Well you can't!
JAYNE	Do a damn sight better job'n you. Getting us lashed over a couple of strays... No offense, Doc, I think it's noble as a grape the way you look to River, but she ain't my sister and she ain't your crew. Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless! So where's it writ we gotta lay down our lives for her, which is what you've steered us toward.
MAL	I didn't start this.
JAYNE	No, the Alliance starts the war -- and then you volunteer. Battle of Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here, how many -- -- I'm talkin' at you -- how many men in your platoon came out of there alive? Mal stares at him.
ZOE	You wanna leave this room.
JAYNE	You're damn right I do. He stalks upstairs. There's a quiet moment.
INARA	This isn't the war, Mal. Mal turns, eyeing her.
MAL	Are you telling me that because you think I don't know --
INARA	You came to the training house looking for a fight.
MAL	I came looking for you.
INARA	I just want to know who I'm dealing with. I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.
MAL	I start fighting a war I guarantee you'll see something new.
TO	Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over:
SIMON	We'll get off. River and I'll get off at Haven and find some --
KAYLEE	Nobody's saying that.
WASH	Nobody besides Jayne is saying that.
INARA	Mal. I got no answers for you, Inara. I got no rudder. Wind blows 40 northerly, I go north. That's who I am. Maybe that ain't a man to lead but they have to follow so you wanna tear me down do it inside your own mind.
INARA	I'm not trying to tear you down --
MAL	But you fog things up. You always have -- you spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere.
INARA	I was. No trouble now, little crazy person... we're going for a nice
I	shuttle ride -- He opens the door and she is on him in an instant, whip blow
MAL	The other way! Find her and-do not engage! Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in ANGLE: SIMON'S POV: There is Jayne, not moving -- and River He starts, then waits as she opens the door. It's gonna be oka -- She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees,
ZOE	She's sealed off the bridge. I do not like her there.
KAYLEE	Cap'n! She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out
MAL	Check the shuttles. She coulda 40 snuck in. He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires. He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates
MAL	The government's man, he says you're a danger to us. Not worth helping. Is he right? Are you anything but a weapon? I've staked my crew's life on the a - person-,-- - actual and whole, and if I'm wrong you'd best shoot me now. Or we could talk more...
RIVER	Miranda. WIt's a planet. Matches the one from her dream.
KAYLEE	How can it be there's a whole planet called Miranda and none of us knowed that?
MAL	Because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable. Terraforming didn't hold, or somesuch. Few settlers died.
RIVER	I had to show them. I didn't know if you were going to make me sleep.
SIMON	You could've asked...
KAYLEE	Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years back, before the war. There was call for workers to settle on Miranda, my daddy talked about going. I should've recalled...
WASH	But there's nothing about it on the Cortex -- History, Astronomy... it's not in there.
MAL	Half of writing history is hiding the truth. There's something on this rock the Alliance doesn't want known.
INARA	That's right at the edge of the Burnham Quadrant, right? Furthest planet out. It's not that far from here... Whoah, no, no --
ZOE	That's a bad notion --
WASH	Honey...
ZOE	I got it, baby.
WASH	Show them the bad... She hits some commands on the screen, pulls back to reveal a
ZOE	This is us, see? And here's Miranda. All along here, this dead space in between, that's Reaver territory.
WASH	They just float out there, sending out raiding parties --
ZOE	Maybe a hundred ships. And more every year. You go through that you're signing up to be a banquet.
WASH	I'm on board with the run and hide scenario -- and we are just about... He looks at his monitors, looks ahead... I s It is a world of fire. Every building burns, some blown right apart. Bodies litter Kaylee heads for the burning church.
KAYLEE	Shepherd? Shepherd Book! She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple. There is
4 MAL	Get the Doc. He moves to the Shepherd, grabs his searching hand. Shepherd... Don't move.
BOOK	Won't go far...
MAL	Shouldn't've been you. I'm so sorry, it was... they should've hit us. They should've hit me.
BOOK	That crossed my mind. I shot him down --
MAL	I seen.
BOOK	I killed the ship... that killed us. Not... very Christian of me.
MAL	You did what's right.
BOOK	Coming from you, that means... almost nothing... HNAAH! Ah, I'm long gone...
MAL	Doc'll bring you round. I look to be bored by many more sermons 'fore you slip -- don't move --
BOOK	Can't... order me around, boy. I'm not one of your crew.
MAL	Yes you are. Book coughs up blood, grabbing Mal. Urgent, almost angry.
BOOK	You... it's on you now... all this death, this shit... you have to find a course. This can't mean nothing. River... you have to...
MAL	Come on, keep it up -- Book grabs Mal's face, talks as though replying to something:
BOOK	I don't care what you believe! Just... believe it. Whatever you have to... His breathing becomes laboured. Hitched. Jayne and Simon run up,Simon slowing down -- going to the them as Jayne looks around him, Mal still fixed on Book.
JAYNE	How come they ain't waiting? They know'd we was coming, how come they only sent one?
MO	Zoe realizes the answer, turns to Wash.
ZOE	Get on the Cortex. Wave the Sanchez brothers, Li Shen -- anyone whose ever sheltered us after a heist. Tell them to get out. Get out now.
Silence.	Every Cortex screen is on, each looking at a different place. Mal stands alone amidst the screens, saying nothing. After
THE OPERATIVE	V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you hide and I cannot let you run. Things become... extreme. And we wish for another way.
MAL	Don't talk at me like a righteous man. You are a killer of children.
THE OPERATIVE	When God wanted Pharaoh to release His people from bondage -- you know the story? He didn't ask. He sent his plagues down upon Egypt. That's me, Captain. The path to peace is paved with corpses. It's always been so.
MAL	So me and mine got to lie down and
R--BETTER-	world?
THE OPERATIVE	I'm not going to live there. How could you think -- there's no place for me there, any more than 40 there is for you. Malcolm, I'm a monster. What I do is evil, I've no illusions about it. But it must be done.
MAL	Why? Do you know why?
THE OPERATIVE	It's not my place to ask.
MAL	You will never see River Tam. I'm telling you this.
THE OPERATIVE	Maybe not. But you'll keep her close now, and when I blow Serenity out of the air, this will be ended. You're so terribly out of your depth, Captain. Your old boat can't take the pressure.
MAL	She ain't buckled yet. And the 40 only reason you're talking such a lot is you can't get a fix on us.
THE OPERATIVE	Yes, your scrambler's code is too old for our seekers. You love that, yes? The small triumph over modernity. You really are the noble savage.
MAL	Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble.
THE OPERATIVE	But that's what's going to kill you, Malcolm. Nobility. It confuses your text, which is self-interest. And sin.
MAL	Only- many-I-know-who still --bel i-eved- in sin just died by your hand.
THE OPERATIVE	What do you believe in?
MAL	Not a solitary thing.
THE OPERATIVE	If that were true, you'd be nothing more than a Reaver. Something changes in Mal's expression. But then, maybe you're not that far from -- Mal flicks a switch and every screen goes dark.
MAL	Get these bodies together.
ZOE	We got time for gravedigging?
MAL	Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope V0 'em together. Five or six of 'em. I want them laid out on the nose of our ship.
SIMON	Are you insane?
KAYLEE	What do you mean, the bodies...
MAL	Kaylee, I need you to muck the reactor core, just enough to leave a trail and make it read like we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us.
KAYLEE	These people are our friends --
MAL	Kaylee, you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it. Jayne, you and Wash hoist up that cannon mount. Goes right on top.
MOO	Piece or two of the other ship, stick it on. Any place you can tear hull without inner breach, do that too. And we're gonna need paint. We're gonna need red paint.
INARA	Sir. Do you really mean to turn our home into an abomination so we can make a suicidal attempt at passing through Reaver space?
MAL	I mean to live. I mean for us to live. The Alliance won't have that, so we go where they won't follow.
JAYNE	V0 God's balls, there's no way we're going out there! And everybody (save River) is talking at once:
SIMON	What's the point of living if you sink to the level of a savage -- Please, we should talk this over --
JAYNE	I ain't takin' orders from a man has lost his brainstem -- , -Mal pule-s-his- in his face, steps back, hand on his.
MAL	This is how it works. Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore, this is your port of harbour. There's a lot of fine ways to die. I'm not waiting for the Alliance to choose mine. He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the I mean to confound those killers, and take my shot at getting to Miranda, maybe finding out what all I'm dying for. That's my theme now. So I hear a word out of any of you that ain't helping me out or taking your leave I will fucking shoot you. He grabs a body -- drops it at Zoe's feet as he heads toward Get to work. We arm past them to the windows of the bridge, looking in at ï¿½Mo
INARA	Mal. He looks up: she's in the corner looking through that trunk
MAL	Didn't see you.
I NARA	I figured that.
MAL	Anything of use in there?
INARA	Maybe. She puts it down and crosses to the bed. He sits by her.
MAL	You don't have to stay in the shuttle, you know. There's empty rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile.
INARA	You think anyone's set to sleep? Simon's portioning out overdoses of morphine, just in case.
MAL	Cheerful fellow. Did you really miss this place?
INARA	Sometimes... Not so much right now. A beat. He doesn't look at her when he asks:
MAL	Why did you leave? Site does lo9}E-at-- t -m-
INARA	Why didn't you ask me not to? Dissatisfied, Mal rises.
MAL	I, uh, I'd better go check on the VW crew. See how the inevitable mutiny is coming along. They both want to say more. They don't. He goes. The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada...
THE OPERATIVE	Define "disappeared". The Ensign just looks uncomfortable.
ZOE	Every reading I'm getting says normal. Oceans, land masses... no tectonic instability or radiation.
WASH	Yeah, but no power, either.
MAL	Nothing at all?
WASH	Wait. Something. Might be a beacon, but it's awful weak.
MAL	Find it.
V0 MAL	Gravity's Earthnorm.
ZOE	02 levels check, pressure... if there's anything wrong the scanner isn't reading it. Mal pulls off his helmet. Breathes, looking around him.
MAL	Well something sure as hell ain't right... WIDER ANGLE: They're in a CITY. Gleaming metal, spread out
JAYNE	
ZOE	We flew over at least a dozen cities just as big. Why didn't we hear about this?
MAL	Beacon's up ahead.
ZOE	Ho. She moves rapidly, gun out, to: Face-down on the ground, clothes tattered. She examines it No entry wound, fractures...
MAL	Poison? Got another one! ANGLE: JAYNE is by a downed hovercraft. Inside are three
JAYNE	They's all just sittin'. Didn't crash... ANGLE: RIVER is quietly becoming more and more upset.
JAYNE (O.S.)	Couple more here... 0 0 orpse _of_aman is pressed up against the glass wall right behind her. Mouth
SIMON	Kaylee... Come this way. Come here. Don't -- But she looks --
KAYLEE	GAAAAaaoh God -- -- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach.
JAYNE	How come they're preserved?
MAL	Place must've gone hermetic when the power blew. Sealed 'em.
KAYLEE	What're they doing? What's everybody doing?
SIMON	There's no discoloration, nobody's doubled over or showing signs of pain...
MAL	There's gasses that kill painless, right?
INARA	But they didn't fall down. None of them. They just lay down.
SIMON	More than anything, it looks like starvation.
MAL	Anybody want to bet there's plenty of food around?
INARA	They just lay down... They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening. As she speaks we see, as she sees, FLASHES: bodies. In
RIVER	, make them stop, they're everywhere, every city every house every room, they're all inside me, I can hear them all and they're saying nothing! GET UP! PLEASE, GET THEM UP! , please God make me a stone... She's starting to damage my calm.
ZOE	Jayne --
JAYNE	She's right! Everybody's dead! This whole world is dead for no reason!
WASH	Let's get to the beacon. A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see ,two
CARON	-- just a few of the images we've recorded, and you can see it isn't.. it isn't what we thought. There's been no war here, and no terraforming event. The environment is stable. It's the Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors. It's... .well it works... it was supposed to calm the population, weed out aggression. Make a peaceful... it worked. The people here stopped fighting. And then they stopped everything else. They stopped going to work, stopped breeding... talking... eating... There's thirty million people here and they all just let themselves die. They didn't even kill themselves. They just... most starved. When they stopped working the power grids, there were overloads, fires -- people burned to death sitting in their V0 chairs. Just sitting. There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts, I have to be quick. There was no one working the receptors when we landed, so we hit pretty hard. We can't leave. We can't take any of the local transports because... The bang again. There are people... they're not people... about a tenth of a percent of the population had the opposite reaction to the Pax. Their aggressor response increased... beyond madness. They've become... they've killed most of us... not just killed, they've done... things. Reavers... they made them...
CARON	I won't live to report this, and we haven't got power to... people have to know... We meant it for the best... to make people safer... to... God! She whirls, grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting at Turn it off. Wash does, nobody saying anything. Mal walks outside.
MAL	I seen so much death... I been on fields carpeted with bodies, friends and enemies -- I seen men and women blown to messes no further from me than you.
INARA	Mal...
MAL	But every single one of those people died on their feet. Fighting. Or, hell, running away -- doing summat to get through. This is...
INARA	Mal, I need your help with this. I need you to help me, because I can't -- He looks at her, folds her into his arms. Brings her face to
SIMON	River...
RIVER	I'm all right. She looks at him, wet eyes full of clarity. I'm all right.
V0	Wash pulls the recording cylinder out of the console.
MAL	This report is maybe twelve years old. Parliament buried it, and it stayed buried til River dug it up. This is what they feared she knew. And they were right to fear, 'cause there's a universe of folk that are gonna know it too. They're gonna see it. Somebody has to speak for these people. He pauses. Everyone waits. You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all V0 come to the same place. So now I'm asking more of you than I have before. Maybe all. 'Cause as sure as I know anything I know this: They will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground, swept clean. A year from now, ten, they'll swing back to the belief that they can make people... better. And I do not hold to that. So no more running. I aim to misbehave. There is a beat as he eyes them all.
JAYNE	My grandma always told me: if you can't do something smart, do something right. By way of emphasis he loudly cocks his big-ass rifle. Mal
MAL	That the same grandma told you 4 there was an evil dwarf spirit living in your well? She was a fun grandma.
SIMON	Do we have a plan?
MAL	Mr Universe. We haven't the equipment to broadwave this code, but he can put it on every screen for thirty worlds. He's pretty damn close, too.
RIVER	Based on our orbital trajectories, he reached optimum proximity just before our sunset. If we make a direct run within the hour we're only 67,332 miles out. At full burn we'd reach him inside of three- hours . She doesn't notice the reactions to her sudden clarity --
WASH	Still got the Reavers, and probably the Alliance between us and him.
ZOE	It's a fair bet the Alliance knows about Mr Universe. They're gonna see this coming.
MAL	No. He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly. They're not gonna see this coming. CLOSE ON: One of Serenity's jet engines, as it FIRES up.
MR UNIVERSE	It's no problem! Bring it on bring it on bring it on! From here to the eyes and ears of the 'verse, that's my motto, or it might be if I start having a motto.
MAL (ON SCREEN)	We won't be long.
MR UNIVERSE	You're gonna get caught in the ion cloud, it'll play merry hob with your radar, but pretty pretty lights and a few miles after you'll be right in my orbit. You'll let us know if anyone else comes at you? DROP BACK WIDE to see: The Operative and ten soldiers are in
MR UNIVERSE	You'll be the first. CLOSE ON: the Operative's sword, as he unsheathes it. Serenity drifts through the armada -- and suddenly another He swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them.
HELMSMAN	I'm reading activity in the cloud.
THE OPERATIVE	Lock and fire on my command. You should have let me see her. We should have done this as men. Not with fire...
HELMSMAN	Sir! ,Wd
THE OPERATIVE	Vessel in range, lock on... Bastard's not even changing course...
THE OPERATIVE	That's not good... Sir?
THE OPERATIVE	Target the Reavers! Target the Reavers! Target everyone! Somebody FIRE!
MAL	We're too close for them to arm --
ZOE	This is gonna be very tight -- Hey look, we're upside down. V0 Zoe and Mal shoot a look at Jayne.
WASH	I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar. She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet
MAL	Chickens come home to roost... They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another The hell -- It's okay! I am a leaf on the wind!
MAL	What does that mean?
4 WASH	We're fried! I got no control!
MAL	Where's the back up? Where's the back up? He and Wash are frantically flipping buttons -- the ship
ZOE	Back up reads at 20%.. Can you get us down?
WASH	I'm gonna have to glide her in!
ZOE	Will that work?
WASH	140 Long as that landing strip is made of fluffy pillows...
MAL	Everybody to the upper decks! Strap yourselves to something!
WASH	I am a leaf on the wind. Watch -- A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales
WASH!	She moves to him -- Wash baby baby no, come on, you gotta move you gotta move baby VW please -- Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
JAYNE	Go! The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons.
MAL	Head inside!
MAL	Come on. Jayne, rearguard. Zoe slows, looking around her.
ZOE	Sir. This is a good hold point_
MAL	We all stay together --
ZOE	No. They have to come through here; they'll bottleneck and we can thin 'em out. We get pushed ,oO back there's the blast doors.
KAYLEE	I can rig 'em so they won't re- open once they close.
MAL	Then shut 'em and hide til -- done. This is the place. We'll buy you the time.
JAYNE	Move those crates back there for cover -- and make sure they ain't filled with anything goes boom.
KAYLEE	Wait, Wash -- where's Wash? Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm. He ain't comin'. Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up.
JAYNE	Move the gorram crates! Come on! We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're
ANGLE: HIS POV	Reavers rush toward them. He turns to Jayne.
MAL	Tell me you brought 'em this time... Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own It explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about. Explodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the
MAL	Zoe... are you here? She looks up at him.
ZOE	Do the job, sir.
MAL	You hold. Hold till I'm back. He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look
JAYNE	Captain's right. Can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this.
ZOE	You really think any of us are gonna get through this? He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a
JAYNE	I might... ANGLE: MR UNIVERSE is lying dead, eyes open, half draped on
V0	Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and
LOVEBOT	Mal. Mal stops. Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me with a sword. How weird is that? I got... a short span here... they destroyed my equipment but I have a back-up unit... bottom of the complex, right over the generator. Hard to get to. I know they missed it. They can't stop the signal, Mal. They can never stop the signal. Okay this is painful. On many levels. I'm not --
A0	She turns back, powering down. Recording over.
RIVER	I can't shut them up...
SIMON	It's okay... -
RIVER	They're all made up of rage. I can't... A BANG as a body slams against the door.
SIMON	Just stay low. I'm right here. Jayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her.
JAYNE	She picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us.
ZOE	Jayne and I take the first wave. Nobody shoots less they get past our fire. Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on
KAYLEE	Oh, I didn't plan on going out like this. I think we did right, but...
SIMON	I never planned... anything. I just wanted to keep River safe. Spent so much time on Serenity trying to find us a home I never realized I already had. She looks at him with soft surprise. My one true regret in all this is never being with you.
KAYLEE	With me? You mean to say, as, sex? I mean to say. Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than
KAYLEE	Hell with this. I'm gonna live. Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth:
MAL	Guy killed me, Mal.
MAL	Hard to get to. That's a fact.
lwï¿½	The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
JAYNE	Zoe... Gorramnit... But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot, ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line! voï¿½ She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly.
MAL	Shot me in the back. I haven't... made you angry, have I? I s
THE OPERATIVE	There's a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now.
MAL	You have no idea how true that is. There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing I know the secret now. The truth that burned up River Tam's brain and set you after her. And the rest of the 'verse is gonna know it too. 'Cause they need to.
THE OPERATIVE	You really believe that?
MAL	I do.
THE OPERATIVE	You willing to die for that belief? I am. The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw Of course, that ain't exactly plan He drops out his cartridge and slams another in.
SIMON	Spine's intact --
ZOE	Just gimme a bandage. Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades)
JAYNE	Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh? Cheaters! He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing.
ZOE	Everybody fall back! Fall back! Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor. Jayne! Grenade!
JAYNE	Very last one... He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from
ZOE	They're gonna get in --
KAYLEE	Can close it... from outside...
ZOE	No one's coming back from that... She tries to stand, fails. How much ammo do we have?
JAYNE	We got three full cartridges and my swingin' cod. That's all. Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.---
INARA	Lift isn't moving...
ZOE	When they come, try to plug the hole with 'em... Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her.
KAYLEE	I'm starting to lose some feeling here... I think there's something in them darts they throwed at me.
SIMON	Lie still. I'm gonna give you something to counteract the -- He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe. My bag. and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
INARA	Keep pressure here...
SIMON	My bag. Need... adrenaline... and a shot of calaphar for Kaylee... I can't... River...? She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of River... I'm sorry...
RIVER	No. No. The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires
SIMON	I hate to... leave...
RIVER	You won't. You take care of me, Simon. You've always taken care of me. She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face My turn. She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG. Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides
THE OPERATIVE	You know what your sin is, Malcolm?
MAL	Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven. He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so But right now... He pulls the sword out, grimacing. Holds it over the vao I'm gonna have to go with Wrath. He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
JAYNE	You suppose he got through? Think Mal got the word out?
ZOE	He got through. I know he got through.
THE OPERATIVE	I'm sorry. The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right You should know there's no shame in this. You've done remarkable things. But you're fighting a war you've already lost. He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
MAL	Iwo Well, I'm known for that. The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back, Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his Piece a shrapnel tore up that nerve cluster my first tour. Had it moved. He squats down, looks the Operative in the face. Sorry 'bout the throat. Expect you'd wanna say your famous last MW words now. Just one trouble. He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the I ain't gonna kill you. He moves to the console, starts prepping it. Hell, I'm gonna grant your greatest wish. He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life. I'm gonna show you a world without sin. He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
CARON (V.0.)	These are some of the first sites we scouted on Miranda. There is no one living on this planet. There is no one... Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other River. She is bloodied, but not killed. She's as she was in the She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
ZOE	Sir?
140 MAL	It's done. Report? Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
SOLDIER	Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now!
ANOTHER SOLDIER	Do we engage? Do we engage? Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the
SOLDIER (O.S.)	Targets are acquired! Do we have a kill order? Do we have an order? The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone, The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash. The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to WIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads. Close on Mal as he watches it go... A beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above,
MAL	If you're here to tell me we ain't finished... then we will be real quick. The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
THE OPERATIVE	Do you know what an uproar you've caused? Protests, riots -- cries for a recall of the entire Parliament. We've seen the broadwaves.
THE OPERATIVE	You must be pleased.
MAL	'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be long 'fore she rolls right over and falls back asleep. Taint my worry.
THE OPERATIVE	I can't guarantee they won't come after you. The Parliament. They have a hundred men like me and they are not forgiving.
MAL	That don't bode especially well for you... giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt...
THE OPERATIVE	I told them the Tams were no longer a threat -- damage done. They might listen, but... I think they know I'm no longer their man.
W MAL	They take you down, I don't expect to grieve overmuch. Like to kill you myself, I see you again.
THE OPERATIVE	You won't. There is... .nothing left to see. Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head "Serenity". You lost everything in that battle. Everything you had, everything you were... how did you go on? Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as You still standing there when the engine starts, you never will figure it out. The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.
MAL	What a whiner...
ZOE	Sir, we have a green light. Inspection's pos and we're clear for upthrust.
MAL	Think she'll hold together?
ZOE	She's tore up plenty. But she'll fly true.
VW	A beat between them before:
MAL	Make sure everything's secure. Could be bumpy.
ZOE	Always is. She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs.
MAL	We're taking her out. Should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls.
INARA	Right.
MAL	You ready to get off this heap and back to a civilized life?
INARA	I, uh... I don't know. He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.
MAL	Good answer. He turns and heads into the bridge.
MAL	You gonna ride shotgun, help me fly? V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the
RIVER	That's the plan.
MAL	Think you can work out how to get her in the -- She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship
MAL	Okay, clearly some aptitude for the... but it ain't all buttons A0 and charts, . You know what the first rule of flying is? Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say.
RIVER	I do. But I like to hear you say it. He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens,
MAL	Love. You can learn all the math in the 'verse, but you take a boat in the air you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as the turning of worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells you she's hurting 'fore she keens. Makes her a home. River also looks out at the sky.
RIVER	Storm's getting worse.
MAL	We'll pass through it soon enough. There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at What was that?
