SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)	My father, Stephan Gold, was the youngest Unit Commander in Mossad.
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)	David Peretz had his twenty-ninth birthday while on the mission.
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)	My mother was even younger. Only twenty-five.
SARAH (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Despite their youth they'd had the courage to confront an unimaginable evil....
SARAH (O.S)	...a man whose sadistic experiments left thousands disfigured or dead, who became known by a name which defiles the annals of medicine: The Surgeon of Birkenau. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 3. Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial. Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin...
SARAH (V.O.)	But this was not what was celebrated. It was their youth itself that became a symbol. Here were the children who had faced Israel's greatest nightmare, her greatest pain... David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches ...and in the simple act of facing the Monster, had helped to vanquish it. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 4. This book is dedicated to my inspiration. My mother, Rachel Singer.
SARAH (CONT'D)	Mother, I'm so very proud to be your daughter.
YOUNG AGENT	David Peretz?
DAVID	Yes.
YOUNG AGENT	You were expecting me?
DAVID	Yes. I was expecting you.
YOUNG AGENT	Would you come with me sir?

DAVID	I - I think I...
SARAH	When are you going to stop?
RACHEL	Stop what?
SARAH	The smoking.
RACHEL	Soon.
SARAH	I hope so. Do it for your grandson.
SARAH	Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow?
RACHEL	It's all arranged, I'm afraid...
SARAH	But we'll have breakfast before you go? I thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach? (Trying to sound casual) I'd like you to see more of him. RACHEL Well, I'll be back. We can...maybe in the holidays or...
MIRIAM	I've marked the place. I thought perhaps from chapter eleven...?
RACHEL	...Yes, thank you. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 8.
SARAH	If you'd rather read something else, mother.....
RACHEL	No, that's fine.
MIRIAM	You must be very proud. RACHEL ...It's a wonderful achievement. I'm very proud of her.
MIRIAM	And I'm sure you were invaluable in the research.

STEPHAN	We're going to David's apartment.
RACHEL	David...?
STEPHAN	I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job. (Beat) I know he came to see you yesterday.
RACHEL	What's this? The jealous ex- husband or the intelligence officer? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 14.
STEPHAN	A little of both. What did he want?
RACHEL	Fuck you.
STEPHAN	What did he tell you?
RACHEL	He didn't tell me anything. (Off his look) He didn't! He told me where he'd been travelling, that he'd been teaching... We spoke for a few minutes and then I had to go.

STEPHAN	You're in my room.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	You're at the end there.
STEPHAN	What do you think of your new wife?
DAVID	Too young.
STEPHAN	Pretty. You didn't notice.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	You know what I've noticed? You don't notice women. I've noticed that. How long have I known you?
DAVID	I don't know.
STEPHAN	Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me?
STEPHAN	Well, well...I think he just noticed. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 21.

RACHEL	Cordoba.
STEPHAN	What were you doing there?
RACHEL	My husband is an Industrial Chemist.
STEPHAN	He does look like a chemist.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	She's not going to fucking break, David. Move. What were you doing before this? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 22.
RACHEL	Before Argentina we lived in Hungary where my husband studied...
RACHEL (CONT'D)	Oh...Liaison.
STEPHAN	And what did you do in Liaison?
RACHEL	Translator.
STEPHAN	So, first time in the field. Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs

NURSE	Frau Roget?
VOGEL	Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm Doctor Bernhardt.
RACHEL	Good morning, doctor.
VOGEL	Alright now, just relax. We're going to do a little examination. If you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say. Alright? SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 25.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	Alright, this is my hand... and this is the speculum. It's going to feel cold. Can I ask how old you are?
RACHEL	Twenty five.
VOGEL	And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby? RACHEL Nearly two years.
VOGEL	Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look fine. Alright, let's see... your cervix is slightly retroverted. Tilted backwards?

RACHEL	Teatro Colon. He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile.

STEPHAN	Bitte sehr.
STEPHAN	One, two, three, four, five, six... It's a ghost station... DAVID West Berlin trains pass through East Berlin on this track, but don't stop.
STEPHAN	Usually.
DAVID (V.O.)	The station's guarded at all times... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 29.
DAVID	...and the stairs to the platform are sealed off. Our train driver makes an unscheduled stop on the near track. The last two carriages will be around...
STEPHAN	...here. And they will be empty. Once that train has stopped, the guards won't be able to see this fence. And on the other side of the fence is...
STEPHAN (V.O.)	...a postal depot.
STEPHAN (V.O.)	The vans come and go all day long.
DAVID	We're just one more parcel. Once we're in West Berlin there'll be transport to Templehof airbase and a private charter.
STEPHAN	That's the wrapping. Now all we need is the present. Rachel realises both men are looking at her.
RACHEL	Try this on. How does it feel? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 31.
STEPHAN	Nice. Here you are, Mossad agent, all those years of training, the highest levels of marksmanship and krav magah, first big mission...sewing.

RACHEL	What is it?
DAVID	It doesn't have a name.
STEPHAN	Shit.
DAVID	Now it does. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 32. It's my birthday.
RACHEL	Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah, at fifteen - study the Talmud. By eighteen - stand under the wedding canopy... STEPHAN We're too late for all of those.
RACHEL	Uh...twenty. In your twenties you are to "pursue your life's goals."
STEPHAN	What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs.
RACHEL	I don't know. I'm waiting to find out.
STEPHAN	Youth...
RACHEL	What about you, grandfather? Have you got a goal?
STEPHAN	Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 33.
RACHEL	So what's your goal?
STEPHAN	Director of Collections by forty.
RACHEL	What about you David. What "life goal" are you pursuing?
DAVID	This is it.
RACHEL	This is it? This is all you want?
RACHEL	Seriously, what do you want out of life?
DAVID	I want this. I want to get Vogel. I want him to be put on trial and I want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. I want them all to know the truth.
DAVID	And...I want another drink.
STEPHAN	Forget about it.
RACHEL	Forget about what? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 34.
STEPHAN	I've spent two years with him, and I don't know him. Nobody knows him. He's alone.
RACHEL	What about family?
RACHEL (CONT'D)	All of them?
STEPHAN (O.S.)	All of them.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	Maybe it's not always a blessing to survive. STEPHAN Vielen dank!
SMARTLY DRESSED MAN	Bitte sehr.
VOGEL	This is my hand. This is the speculum. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 35.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	How did you find me?
RACHEL	What?
VOGEL	Who told you about me?
RACHEL	Who... told us?
VOGEL	Were you referred by a doctor, or...?
RACHEL	Oh, Doctor Eisenberg.
VOGEL	Ah-ha. How is the old Jew?
RACHEL	Very good.
VOGEL	Any history of infertility in your family Frau Roget? RACHEL No.
VOGEL	Are your periods irregular?
RACHEL	Yes.
VOGEL	Yes. I think we've found the problem.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	It's very common. Your ovarian follicles...well, inside you're still immature. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 36.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	We need to help you with this. There's something we can use, a little injection. Do you want to proceed?
VOGEL (CONT'D)	How many brothers and sisters do you have?
RACHEL	None.
VOGEL	An only child?
VOGEL (CONT'D)	And yet you say there's no family history of fertility problems?
RACHEL	I lost my mother in the war.
DAVID	Are you alright?
STEPHAN	Identity is confirmed. We have a green light. David looks at her as Rachel spreads her hair around her
DAVID	It's a brave thing you're doing.
RACHEL	I'm not brave. I'm terrified.
DAVID	But you're doing it anyway. Because you know how important it is. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 38.
DAVID	You're very brave.
RACHEL	David...
STEPHAN	It's whiskey.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	You're so beautiful...
VOGEL	Alright, this is my hand. And this is the speculum.
RACHEL	Okay.
VOGEL	You had intercourse last night?
RACHEL	Yes.
VOGEL	Good. You're at the most fertile stage of your cycle. This is very good timing.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	I think we are going to see results. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 40.

NURSE	My God! What happened?!
RACHEL	I don't know! I don't know! He just clutched his chest and collapsed!
NURSE	I need an ambulance! Karl-Gustav- Strasse. The clinic. My husband has had a heart attack.

NURSE	Oh God!
STEPHAN	He's going to be alright.
DAVID	I'm sorry, Madam, but you'll need to meet us at the hospital.
NURSE	But... I want to travel with him.
DAVID	Not possible I'm afraid. New regulations. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 44.
RACHEL	Don't worry, he's in good hands now. He's going to be fine.
NURSE	Thank you...thank you.

RACHEL	Yes.

WORKER	...it's just on the corner. You should come along. They're almost there.
DRIVER	There's something on the tracks up here! FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 49.
RACHEL	Well, maybe I'll see you there? I finish in half an hour. Why don't you go and get me a drink ready?
WORKER	Half an hour then. Stephan and David turn back to the van.
WORKER	What was that...? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 50.
DAVID	Fuck.
RACHEL	I think it came from over here?
WORKER	No, it was one of those...
BORDER GUARD (O.S.)	Stay where you are!
BORDER GUARD	There's nothing there. Get moving now!
FIRST GUARD	What are you doing here?
RACHEL	I work here. I'm on a break.
FIRST GUARD	Show me your papers, both of you.
STEPHAN	We have to go!
STEPHAN	We can make it. Help me with him...
FIRST GUARD	You can go.
STEPHAN	We're going! Now! FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 52.

STEPHAN	Is he dead? (Beat) Is he dead?
RACHEL	Who?
STEPHAN	The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead? RACHEL No.
STEPHAN	How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection?
STEPHAN	Did you give him the...
RACHEL	I don't know! I thought I... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 55.
STEPHAN	Jesus Christ!
STEPHAN	We could have gone!
DAVID	It's not over.
STEPHEN	We could have fucking...!
DAVID	WE STILL HAVE HIM! IT'S NOT OVER! We still have him. A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and
RACHEL	What did he say?
RACHEL	You made contact?
RACHEL	What did he say? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 56.
DAVID	It's going to take time. They need to open up a new route, they need to find political help. Maybe the Americans. Two weeks... maybe three.
DAVID	We work four shifts guarding him. We feed him at the end of each shift. We never leave him alone.
STEPHAN	And you're compromised. You don't leave the fucking house.
DAVID	We can do this. We just need to stay focussed.
VOGEL	.....Fucking assholes! Fucking pig shit food! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 57.
DAVID	At this rate he's going to starve himself to death before we can get him back.
VOGEL	My wife.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	Is she hurt? Is she alright?
VOGEL (CONT'D)	Please? Tell me she's alright.
STEPHAN	You can't talk to him.
RACHEL	I didn't say anything.
STEPHAN	You can't listen to him.
RACHEL	I know. I just...
STEPHAN	I'm not angry -
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	- I'm just telling you - we don't talk to him. We don't listen to him. He isn't there. He isn't a human being. He...
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	We have a date. Ten days time. The Americans are going to help.
RACHEL	Good. Rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom, for
STEPHAN	Fuck!
VOGEL	Why don't you just kill me now?
VOGEL (CONT'D)	How can you keep me waiting to die like this!
VOGEL	I know what you want. You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands. But that isn't true. There will be blood on your hands. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 61.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	You will be my murderer! You fucking hypocrite. You fucking...
VOGEL (CONT'D)	Yes. Do it. You want to do it...
VOGEL (CONT'D)	That's right. I'd forgotten. You Jews never knew how to kill. Only how to die. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 62.
VOGEL	I was dreaming about my wife.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	One of the great regrets of my life is that we were unable to have children. My wife would have made a wonderful mother.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	It's a great blessing. Rachel stares at him.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	You should try lemons. For the morning sickness.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	They say it helps.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	What's your name? (Beat) Sarah? You Jews stay close to your roots, don't you? It's a good thing. Very good. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 63.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	I loved the bible as a child. Retribution. Higher justice.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	Yes. I understand you perfectly. (Beat) You weren't lying at the clinic when you told me about your mother were you? About her death?
VOGEL (CONT'D)	I'm very sorry for your loss. It almost takes her breath away. She tears the tape and
DAVID	What happened? What's the matter?
RACHEL	Nothing. He...nothing.

DAVID	It's alright. It's alright. It's nearly over.
RACHEL	Why didn't you go? At the station. You could have got away. Why didn't you? There is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and,
RACHEL (CONT'D)	What did they say?
DAVID	Stephan? STEPHAN It's not happening.
DAVID	What the fuck does that mean?
STEPHAN	The Americans have pulled out. (To Rachel) Has he been fed?
DAVID	So...so what does that mean?
RACHEL	Oh God... SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 65.
STEPHAN	Did you feed him?
DAVID	What does that mean? What's the plan now?

STEPHAN	I said has he...? DAVID I'm asking you...
STEPHAN	I'm talking to her! Supposedly it's her shift now, but instead be doing she's out here with you! fucking question: Did you feed him?
RACHEL	YES! I fed him!
STEPHAN	There's no plan. There's no fucking plan. They said the operation is being "re- evaluated."
STEPHAN	You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 66.
STEPHAN	It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can. No.
STEPHAN	It's happening. I can feel it.
RACHEL	They can't just leave us!
STEPHAN	Yes they can! Because we fucked it all up! We fucked it all up and now we're on our own!
DAVID	Were you followed? Could you have been...?
RACHEL	Stephan? Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN.

STEPHAN	If it's them, he dies. SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 67.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)	Move.

STEPHAN	He's not getting away from me.
DAVID	This isn't the mission.
STEPHAN	I decide what the mission is! If I say he dies, he dies.
DAVID	We're finishing this mission. We're taking him back.

STEPHAN	It's your shift.
DAVID	Did you know about this?
RACHEL	About what?
DAVID	His mouth's taped. You want him to suffocate?

STEPHAN	You don't give orders David. It's your shift now so you can go back in there...
RACHEL	Stop it! FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 70.

DAVID	Rachel... RACHEL Get out of my way, please. I'm just going to go out for a few minutes. That's all I want to do.
DAVID	She wants to go out.
RACHEL	No one will see me. Tell him, David. I just want to walk. I just want to get some...air. Please. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 71.
STEPHAN	Don't be stupid.
RACHEL	GET OFF ME!
VOGEL	Thank you. David.
David doesn't react.	Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching David and Stephan and Rachel...
VOGEL (CONT'D)	If I had a choice I'd prefer Rachel to feed me. So gentle...in another life, the makings of a Nurse, I think...in another life...
VOGEL (CONT'D)	How is she today? SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 72.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	You should let her get more rest. It's a dangerous time, the first month or two of the pregnancy.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	You didn't know?
VOGEL (CONT'D)	You're not the father then? (Beat)I thought it would be you. I thought...I don't know. The way you look at her. The way she looks at you...
VOGEL (CONT'D)	Women can be like that, they like to make you dance first, I remember. (As though to himself) So, she chose the other one...?
VOGEL (CONT'D)	That must be hard, watching them together, right in front of you. And you not saying a word. Like the Poet says - "Great souls suffer in silence." I wouldn't have taken Stephan as a family man. Too ambitious, too...? Whereas you? David, I see you with children...
DAVID	Shut up.
VOGEL	I am expressing my sympathy. For your suffering.
DAVID	What does a monster like you know about suffering? SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 73.
VOGEL	I'm a doctor, David.
DAVID	A doctor. (beat)You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes. You inject people with petrol. You...you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they...
DAVID (CONT'D)	This isn't medicine. This is disease. This is sickness. VOGEL So we were all insane? Is that the answer?
DAVID	There's no answer. I'm not looking for an answer. I'm not looking for...
VOGEL	You're trembling.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	It's strange. Here I am - the victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to be murdered, but I think you are the one that is afraid, David. (Beat) Afraid of the monster.
VOGEL (CONT'D)	Boo. Yes. Do you know why it was easy to exterminate you people? Your weakness. I saw it. Every day I saw it. Every one of them, thinking only of how to avoid being flogged, or kicked, or killed. Only thinking of themselves. Why do you think it only took four soldiers to lead a thousand people to the gas chambers? Entire families? Because not one, out of thousands, had the courage to resist, the courage to be the first to fall. Not one would sacrifice himself. Even when we took their children from them. I knew then that you people had no right to live, no right to...
STEPHAN	Out. We're going out. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 75.
