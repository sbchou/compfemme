CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
LYNCH	I don't see her.
DAN	The shift change is late. Just wait.
PARKER	Are you sure about this?
DAN	We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.
LYNCH	I'm cute.
PARKER	Is um... is that her?
DAN	Shit.
LYNCH	Dude.
DAN	It's cool, it's cool. Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him-
PARKER	-What? Me? No way. This is your thing. easy. All you do is tell the guy that you and your friends-
LYNCH	-GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".
DAN	-you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets. Start at $50. That's what we usually give the other lady. He'll take it. Trust me.
PARKER	Dan, no. You do it. I feel stupid.
DAN	You've got this. You can totally do this.
LYNCH	Parker, you've so got this.
DAN	The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no.
PARKER	Why me?
LYNCH	`Cause you're a girl.
DAN	A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. There.
PARKER	My charming smile?
PARKER	Hey. Could I bum a smoke? Thanks. I'm Parker.
JASON	Jason.
PARKER	Oh, cool. My brother's name is Jason.
JASON	OK.
PARKER	Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid... My girlfriends and I drove all the way up here from Salem State, and I was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that I could cover the lift tickets on my Mom's credit card...but then I left her credit card at the gas station...and so...
JASON	Right.
PARKER	No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know?
JASON	How much?
PARKER	Like...fifty?
JASON	I could lose my job.
LYNCH	He's not going for it.
DAN	Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?
LYNCH	Minimum.
DAN	-Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more.
LYNCH	She had to come skiing with us?
DAN	You said you didn't mind?
LYNCH	I don't. I don't mind. Don't mind at all. beat. I'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with
R	us since last semester. You never come around for Monday night football, nobody has seen you at-
A	-I watched the game with you last week!
LYNCH	For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes.
M	They're lots of ten minutes-es, you know?
DAN	Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you... LYNCH No, no it's fine. I'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn't even know how to board yet.
	DAN She's getting better. Now I feel like a dick. You should have said something if it was a problem.
LYNCH	It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything. Dan smiles at Lynch. DAN Good work! See? They always go for it. PARKER I did good, right?
LYNCH	You did great.
A	
DAN	Oh, so where's my change?
PARKER	There isn't any. DAN You gave him the full hundred?
PARKER	He wasn't going for it at 50.
D	So what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there? Like, I don't know, $51 or maybe even $75? You gave me two 50's. What was I supposed to do, ask for change?
LYNCH	I would have asked for change.
PARKER	It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right?
LYNCH	I would have definitely asked him for change. They get up to the front of the line. Jason looks at Dan and
JASON	"Girlfriends"?
X	Parker gives him an apologetic smile.
A	DAN Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby. PARKER Oh, now I'm "baby"? You never call me pet names.
DAN	I'm just not a `pet name' guy.
D	PARKER He calls me "Parker." DAN It's your name.
PARKER	Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like "honey" or "sweetie".
LYNCH	I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here.
DAN	See? At least I don't call you "O'Neil".
PARKER	You don't touch my face enough either. laughs.
LYNCH	
R	Third wheel.
A	Watch it, Lynch.
LYNCH	Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.
M	shoots Dan a look: "Oh, really?"
DAN	Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck. Sweetie.
D	a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face. Aww!
LYNCH	Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?
PARKER	I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right?
DAN	You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike. Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board?
LYNCH	Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.
X	DAN That's what they said about rap.
R	LYNCH Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain air, huh? Kind of smells like... cancer. PARKER You know what, I am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts.
LYNCH	At least pot does something for you. Cigarettes are just gross. Especially out in the cold. It like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss.
D	
DAN	Used floss? Where do you come up with this shit.
	Have you ever sniffed your floss? It's nasty.
DAN	No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you? Gimme a drag.
PARKER	What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.
LYNCH	Oh no. She broke the rule.
X	Parker you just broke the first rule. What?
DAN	No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this
A	is to relax and have fun. Worry about school when you get home.
PARKER	But, I haven't read a-
M	chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly. The suddenly shut off.
D	SKIERS and BOARDERS in the surrounding chairs express
	DAN It's alright.
LYNCH	Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?
PARKER	No.
LYNCH	So it doesn't bother you when I do this?
PARKER	Quit it!
PARKER (cont'd)	I'm not afraid of heights. I just don't like them.
DAN	Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off
R	of a lift.
PARKER	Points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up.
A	LYNCH Yeah, statistics don't work on smokers. Oh, shut-up.
LYNCH	OK, WHAT ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET ON THE CHAIR RIGHT?
D	echoes from the chairs behind him. COME ON, I PAID GOOD MONEY TO DO SOME SKIING!
DAN	Actually, I paid good money.
LYNCH	Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! WOO!
X	He playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as
R	The three begin to get situated with their boards and skis.
PARKER	Why do I have to wear a helmet?
A	DAN Safety first.
PARKER	But you guys don't wear them.
M	She looks around.
PARKER (cont'd)	I only see little kids wearing them. Cause they're still learning, too. Come on, I'm not gonna argue about this. Even extreme boarders wear helmets. Nobody makes fun of them.
DAN / LYNCH	Awww.
PARKER	You're just doing this to make fun of me.
DAN	No, I'm not. I swear. You look hot in a helmet.
X	nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.
LYNCH	Need some help?
R	SHANNON Do you think?
A	into his face.
M	the strap with his other.
PARKER	Aww, check out Lynch. See? Chick magnet.
	RYAN What the hell?
LYNCH	Woah! Shit, man! I was just trying to help!
SHANNON	Ryan, what the hell?
RYAN	He had his hands all over you!
SHANNON	No he didn't. I can take care of myself!
X	and Shannon help Lynch to his feet. I am so sorry about that. He can
R	be such an asshole sometimes.
LYNCH	I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even
A	compete with a catch like that?
SHANNON	Are you OK?
LYNCH	Yeah, I'm fine.
SHANNON	Well, thank you for your help. I am so, so sorry about that.
D	I'm Shannon, by the way.
LYNCH	Joe.
RYAN	Shan!
SHANNON	Well it was nice to meet you.
LYNCH	I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
DAN	I know you were, man. Come on. Don't sweat it.
LYNCH	Seriously, that guy was such a dick.
X	PARKER Come on boys. We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom.
R	Lynch starts down the hill.
DAN	I'm tough. PARKER I know you are. Dan, Parker, and Lynch move down the mountain on their snow
D	Finally, Parker comes to a stop on her own next to Dan and he
E	Look at you! See? Having fun?
PARKER	Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too.
LYNCH	Last one to the bottom is buying dinner! Parker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in
DAN	We gotta take a weekend trip up North one of these days. Hit up Killington or Okemo and really do it up right. Why don't we just do it over Christmas. You and me.
DAN	Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like
M	the stuff you see in commercials. We had to take like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see.
LYNCH	Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill
D	all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight? DAN Dude, you didn't have to stay with us. It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few.
LYNCH	No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point. feels horrible.
PARKER	You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go-
X	Lynch feels horrible.
LYNCH	-no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that.
R	looks to Dan.
PARKER	I told you I didn't have to come.
A	LYNCH Parker, I didn't not want you to come.
M	
DAN	It was his idea that we invited you in the first place.
LYNCH	Exactly. Remember? I was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come
D	with us?" And you were like-
DAN	-I was like, "OK that would be cool".
	isn't buying it. She puts on a smile.
PARKER	It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway. Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages.
DAN	No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell.
X	laughs.
PARKER	She does not.
R	looks to Lynch.
DAN	Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom
A	kept calling and calling. And what did she want? She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer. LYNCH What did you say? You said chicken. Hell yes, I said chicken, but that's not the point. The point is you can go a few more hours without hearing from Annette.
PARKER	I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today.
LYNCH	You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, "Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..."
X	Parker and Dan are beaming at him. He knows he's beat.
LYNCH (cont'd)	What?
A	From their POV the chair lift is still moving but the line is
M	Joe!
LYNCH	Wait up.
D	the lift line.
SHANNON	Hey. I just wanted to apologize again. LYNCH Oh, no big deal. He's just lucky he didn't make me mad. You know, I just look half your boyfriend's size.
SHANNON	Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work.
LYNCH	No way.
SHANNON	A group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. It's a whole story and-
X	-I don't want to hold you up. But that was just really embarrassing. So I just wanted to say sorry. Are you gonna be here next weekend?
LYNCH	Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.
A	SHANNON Cool. Well, my roommate and I come like every Sunday, so maybe I'll see you.
M	That would be...a nice time.
SHANNON	OK. See ya later.
D	jogs after Shannon again.
LYNCH	Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or
	something? That way I'll...know how to catch up with you and stuff.
SHANNON	Yeah, sure.
LYNCH	Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen?
SHANNON	Don't ski with a pen. Sorry.
LYNCH	Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good.
SHANNON	You know it's a gateway drug right? Kidding.
LYNCH	Whew. You! That's so like you!
M	He puts a red flag on the back of a chair that heads up the
DAN	But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs!
D	
JASON	It's not my decision, man. They're closing early. You're only open three days a week. You can't afford to close early.
JASON	Why don't you write a letter?
LYNCH	Remember "429".
DAN	What? Just remember "429".
PARKER	
X	Come on, just one more run.
JASON	Sorry. DAN Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have. LYNCH Hey man, do you have a pen? JASON It's not about the money. They need to clear the mountain. We've got weather coming in. There's nothing I can do.
PARKER	What if we promise to run straight
D	down. Like the quickest run ever.
DAN	Wicked fast.
	struggles. He sighs and looks around. There are still
JASON	Fine. But hurry. DAN PARKER you! Thank you so much!
DAN	We'll be wicked fast. Like the wind!
LYNCH	Seriously. For a hundred bucks
X	you'd think he could cut us some slack.
DAN	I know right? They're supposed to
R	stay open until 10 on Sundays. Whatever happened to night skiing?
LYNCH	Wachusett still has night skiing. We should have gone there. It's kinda like Ward Hill but not as lame. Hey, you remember the numbers I told you?
DAN	
PARKER	Good for you, Lynch. You got her number! DAN What did He-Man have to say about that? That guy? Who cares? Steroids shrink your dick. Wait, shit. What were my four numbers? "5022". Parker, will you remember "5022"?
PARKER	Nope. A fellow employee (RIFKIN) approaches.
RIFKIN	Early night, huh?
JASON	You're not gonna hear me complain.
X	
RIFKIN	Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office. Something about next weekend's schedule. JASON I'm not working next weekend.
A	Oh, come on. It's my brother's bachelor party. I put in for it two months ago. RIFKIN Go talk to the boss. He's getting ready to leave.
JASON	I'm the best man! Shit. Rifkin takes his place.
RIFKIN	Ready to shut down?
E	As Jason runs away he turns back.
JASON	There's three more on their way down. Wait for them, then it's all set.
PARKER	I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving.
DAN	Why didn't you have some pizza?
PARKER	You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate? That wasn't pizza. That was like,
X	`roller skating rink birthday party pizza'.
LYNCH	There's a Papa Gino's on our way
R	back. It's like 15 minutes down the road from the mountain.
PARKER	Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real
A	pizza myself.
DAN	Check it out!
M	look down to see THREE SKIERS hit a huge jump, one after
DAN (cont'd)	We are so hitting that jump. Last run. Gotta make it count.
PARKER	Jesus!
DAN	It's just wind, Parker.
LYNCH	Don't you mean, "baby"?
DAN	Who invited you?
X	HEYMAN (another employee) runs by him on his way to the Heyman! HEY, HEYMAN! Do me a solid? I've gotta piss so bad I can taste it. Can you just take over for 2 minutes?
M	saying to him. He keeps running. Asshole.
D	A low, distant thunder roll echoes far away.
PARKER	Shit. Do you hear that?
E	
DAN	It's the mountains. It snows every night. Relax.
PARKER	Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. I'm not even kidding.
X	Nothing. minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him.
A	Last chair is through.
RIFKIN	Cool. Last three just hit. I'm
M	clear. Clear up here.
E	white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them
DAN	Oh, come on.
PARKER	Bur!
LYNCH	IT'S FRIGGIN COLD UP HERE! NO TIME FOR THIS CRAP! THANK YOU!
X	
PARKER	It's gonna start again, right?
DAN	Yes. Anyone got any jokes? What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity?
DAN	"Get off me, you're crushing my
M	Marlboros".
LYNCH	I told you that?
E	light of converging white strings.
DAN	What do you think the worst way to die would be?
PARKER	That's not morbid.
LYNCH	Yeah, seriously. That's kinda spooky, Dan.
DAN	I think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go. Not if it was like one of those
R	surfers where they get hit from behind and they don't even know what happened. You know. Cause it like came up
A	from beneath them. Like on the Jaws poster.
LYNCH	The chick on the Jaws poster was hot.
PARKER	She was?
LYNCH	I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot.
D	
DAN	But if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water. That would be worse than actually
	getting eaten. Knowing that this animal is coming for you but you can't get away. And that it's going to eat you. Like you're gonna get eaten alive? Have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal?
LYNCH	That's why I only swim in pools.
PARKER	I think burning to death would be the worst.
LYNCH	Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.
PARKER	I remember watching TV for like 3
X	days straight after 9/11. That footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the Trade Center? Can you imagine how bad it was inside
R	to know that jumping was a better way out?
LYNCH	But they say that when you jump from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it.
PARKER	OK, then Lynch. What is the worst
M	way to die?
LYNCH	What?
PARKER	No, you have an answer for
D	everything. What's your biggest fear?
	LYNCH Easy. The Sarlaac pit.
PARKER	The what?
LYNCH	The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever.
DAN	"I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!"
LYNCH	Shut-up. Why hasn't it started again?
DAN	Give it a minute.
R	LYNCH This is nothing man. At Stowe last year, me and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. This big chick fell getting off up top and
A	twisted her leg. It was like- "move her to the side and keep the line going people". But no. They had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to-
M	BOOM. The lights go out.
D	They sit in darkness.
E	At first no one can speak.
DAN	WHAT THE FUCK??! HELLO???!!!!
LYNCH	Come on now! This is messed up.
PARKER	HEY! TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON! HELLO!!!!
DAN	Are they fucking kidding?
LYNCH	I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie. DAN HE-LLO!!!!!!!!!!!????
R	PARKER No one knows we're up here. They forgot that we're up here. DAN No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now. starts waving around his hands. WE'RE FREEZING UP HERE!!!
PARKER	What if they don't start it again?
D	What if everyone went home?
DAN	Will you stop?!
	They didn't go home. Stop freaking me out. Remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down. This is horse shit.
LYNCH	What did you say to the guy?
DAN	Me? Nothing!
LYNCH	Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.
DAN	I didn't do anything! He knows we're still up here.
PARKER	Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut
X	off the lights and scare the customers?
DAN	They just lost power or something.
R	I'm sure it's gonna come back on any second. They didn't go home. That's retarded.
A	a few more moments.
LYNCH	This is so messed up. DAN It's a power outage. They'll come up with a ladder if they have to. We need to get down from here. We can't just sit up here. Why isn't the goddamn chair moving, Dan? What the hell?!
DAN	Well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move. Just chill out.
PARKER	Don't yell at me.
DAN	I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night?
LYNCH	Free lift tickets.
PARKER	What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us.
X	made a good point. But still...
DAN	We won't be stuck here all night.
R	PARKER No. You're right. We won't be here all night. It's Sunday. Its fucking Sunday and they aren't
A	open again until Friday. We'll be stuck here all week. We're gonna die up here.
LYNCH	We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even
D	if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here- we can jump. I see people jump off of chair lifts all the time.
DAN	It's true. I've done it before. You just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. It's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it.
PARKER	-HELP!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!!!! HEL-LO!!! HELP!!!!!
DAN	Shh. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this.
X	moments pass in silence as they survey their situation. I have to pee.
A	I have to pee wicked bad.
LYNCH	That makes two of us.
M	Ew, Lynch if you pull out your junk in front of me I'm gonna puke.
LYNCH	Well, what do you want me to do? I gotta go. How am I supposed to go? Well if we just lift the bar up you could probably just bend over if we hold on to you.
PARKER	Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!!
LYNCH	It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway.
PARKER	Well I like the safety bar and I like it down where it's supposed to be.
DAN	Then how are you going to piss?
PARKER	I can hold it. For a whole week? Sorry. She's the one who said we'd be here for "a week"! takes a deep breath.
PARKER	I can hold it. I'm telling you, five minutes from now we'll all be laughing.
LYNCH	I'm pissing.
D	
DAN	I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope they ban you from the
	mountain. That's so nasty.
LYNCH	Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back. There. Much better.
DAN / PARKER / LYNCH	HELP! / HEL-LO! / UP HERE!
X	Almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down at them.
R	Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder.
LYNCH	SOMEBODY GET US DOWN FROM HERE!
A	HELP!
DAN	Put the safety bar down, Joe.
M	LYNCH SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!
DAN	Put the bar down. SOMEONE- PUT THE BAR DOWN!
E	Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from Dan.
R	Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them.
A	
M	bottom. It's headlights shine across the trees in front of
D	Dan begins to cheer.
DAN	What did I tell you guys, huh? WOO- HOO! UP HERE!
E	PARKER Oh, thank God.
PARKER	UP HERE! DAN HELLO!
A	look like it's going to stop.
M	Panic sets in yet again.
PARKER	Why isn't he stopping?
LYNCH	HEY! WHAT THE HELL?!!
D	
E	STEVE (the driver) concentrates on the path. The roar of his
VOICE (O.C.)	Steve.
STEVE	Go for Steve. We got a problem here.
X	Below them, the Snow Cat slows down to a halt.
R	DAN / PARKER / LYNCH THANK YOU! / WOO! / YES!!
M	It's nothing but ice at the bottom of Wildcat so you're gonna have to cut over to the south hill and come around the side.
STEVE	That's gonna take me 20 minutes!
D	Sorry brother, but it's a frozen swimming pool down here.
LYNCH	What is this asshole doing?
PARKER	No! No!
X	inches.
R	Parker takes off her helmet and throws it down.
M	Though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three The Snow Cat drives away. Lynch throws one of his ski poles but doesn't even come
PARKER	NOOOO!!!!!! The moon shines down on the mountain. It glistens like a The three shiver uncontrollably.
R	Finally.
PARKER	My face is burning. DAN The power is coming back on soon.
PARKER	No it isn't.
DAN	It has to. Anyone know what time it is? I
D	don't wear a watch.
LYNCH	Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the
E	locker real quick and I'll find out. OK, top 3 breakfast cereals of all time. Go. I'll go first.
PARKER	Stop.
LYNCH	Crunch Berries...
PARKER	Please, stop.
X	Apple Jacks...
DAN	Dude, quit it. LYNCH ...and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky Charms pre-purple horseshoes.
A	There's just something weird about eating purple horseshoes, am I right?
M	
PARKER	Everyone went home. They left us up here.
LYNCH	Top 3 celebrities you'd do. Me first again? Fine...
	DAN Someone has to jump. We can't just sit up here until next weekend. We'll die. Dan puts an arm around her. Shhh. It's OK.
LYNCH	SOMEBODY HELP US!!
X	voice is getting hoarse.
PARKER	I don't want to die up here.
DAN	You're not gonna die, baby. I
A	won't let you die. OK? I promise I won't let you die. I'm so scared.
DAN	It's alright. It's alright.
D	Hey. It's snowing.
	LYNCH Great. Best Christmas present you ever got? Go.
PARKER	Shayna. My puppy.
DAN	Disneyworld in 8th grade.
LYNCH	Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh? takes off her glove to light a cigarette.
R	PARKER Shit! See? That's where smoking gets you.
PARKER	Shut-up.
M	keeps struggling with the lighter but eventually gives -what, what are you doing?
DAN	I'm jumping. I'm gonna get help.
	LYNCH Dan...woah. Let's talk about this.
PARKER	No. No, don't leave me up here.
DAN	Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as long as I can get to the bottom I....your skin is so red. You're getting frost bite.
LYNCH	You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops?

LYNCH	Dan, it's a far drop. I don't know.
M	DAN Do you have a better idea? I'm telling you, I've totally jumped off of a lift before. If we can wait `til morning I bet someone will come up here. Like a snow groomer or some shit.
	Really? And why would they come groom the snow on a day when they aren't open, Joe? A day when they still have a full work week before they open again? I can do this.
PARKER	No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt.

DAN	I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom.

PARKER	DAN! DANNY? Oh my god!

LYNCH	Dan, say something. Are you alright? My legs. I broke my fucking legs.
LYNCH	Oh, shit.
PARKER	Can you move? Dan? Hold on. Hold on, baby.
LYNCH	What are you doing?
PARKER	I gotta...I have to get to him.
R	LYNCH You'll just get hurt, too. Stop. Calm down. PARKER Calm down?! Talk to me, Danny!
DAN	Stay there. Don't get off the
D	chair.
PARKER (O.C.)	How bad is it?
E	Dan can see that his legs are shattered and that he is
DAN	It's bad. It's really fucking bad. SOMEONE HELP US! PLEASE!
LYNCH	OK. Alright. You gotta stay
X	strong for me, Parker. Can you do that?
R	If we go to pieces we're never gonna get through this, OK? What are we gonna do? We're gonna die up here.
LYNCH	Buddy, can you move at all?
M	
DAN	I can't even stand up. LYNCH You can't, like...I don't know, slide down the hill or something?
DAN	My legs are shattered, asshole! I'm bleeding to death- NO, I CAN'T SLIDE DOWN THE FUCKING MOUNTAIN!
LYNCH (O.C.)	Alright, alright. Um...?
DAN	...so much blood. PARKER Can you stop the bleeding? With what?
PARKER	Here... She takes off her scarf and tosses it below. SHIT!
LYNCH	Here you go, Dan. I'm throwing mine down. I can't see. Just feel for it, OK? Here it comes...
DAN	What do I do with this? Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing.
X	DAN I'm so cold.
A	
PARKER	Here, take my coat. No! Don't you take off your coat!
M	You need it!
PARKER	No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please-
DAN	-Parker, keep your coat on.
E	Dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties the elastic Shit! Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding.
DAN	I...I've got it.
PARKER	Are you sure.
X	DAN Yup.
R	Moments pass with only their breathing. Are you sure you can't try and get
A	down the hill, buddy?
M	No, man. I can't move. I can't move.
D	Lynch holds his head.
LYNCH	Alright. Hold on.
E	Once again, Lynch starts looking all around. Above, below.
LYNCH (cont'd)	Maybe...if I could climb up to the lift cable? Maybe I could like, scale across to the other chairs until I find one that isn't quite so high up from the ground?
PARKER	You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs?
LYNCH	I can't even do a pull-up. You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy.
LYNCH	There was no reason to embarrass myself. I knew I couldn't do it. You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking did it. You can do it.
LYNCH	Even if I made it across to the
A	next chair...how many more would it take before I found one closer to the ground? Every lift pole has an emergency ladder on it. LYNCH OK. The chair that's two back. Does it look like it's near the pole? PARKER I don't know. I can't see.
LYNCH	Shit, that's far. Just. Just give me a second.
PARKER	What if you fall, too?
LYNCH	Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death.
PARKER	Maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here.
X	Maybe, they'll need to do maintenance on the lift or something, you know?
R	What's going on up there? You guys?
PARKER	We're right here, baby.
LYNCH	Yeah, man. We didn't go anywhere. I think...I think I'm gonna try and climb back to the pole. If the chair is close enough, maybe...
M	maybe I can jump to it.
DAN	Do it. Please do it now. Just hang in there, Dan. It's gonna be OK.
LYNCH	It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now.
PARKER	What can I do to help?
X	LYNCH Just hold on to my legs. You can't really stop me from falling...but it's, you know...psychological or something you know?
R	maneuvers herself to hold Joe's legs.. OK...OK...just give me a second.
PARKER	I think we should wait til morning. We can make it a few more hours.
M	LYNCH Us? Maybe. But not him.
D	Lynch gets ready to try and stand again...we hear
	a sort of "moan" rings in the distance.
PARKER	Baby, is that you?
DAN (O.C.)	What?
LYNCH	Shh!
DAN	Oh, motherfucker. Lynch tries to control the panic.
LYNCH	It's alright man. It's just a
A	coyote or something. They're scared of people. It probably won't even come anywhere near us, OK?
M	That sounded like a fucking wolf.
LYNCH	Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England?
E	is becoming.
DAN	I read about one on-line somewhere last year. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Wolves around here are pussies. They aren't even that big.
PARKER	It could be worse, right? How the hell...could this be worse?
X	PARKER It could be the Sarlacc Pit.
R	It's uncomfortable and forced as hell. But it's a
LYNCH	Parker- coming through with the
A	tension breaker, look out! She's alright, Walker. Your girl is alright.
M	OK...here we go. Holy shit, is that high up.
	What can I do?
LYNCH	Nothing. Just be quiet.
DAN (O.C.)	You can do this, Lynch. You've got it.
LYNCH	Please stop talking. Woa-! The whole back of this thing is ice.
R	protection.
LYNCH (O.C.)	Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should
A	be able to reach the top.
M	Dan takes his gloves away from his face...only to freeze in
D	DAN You guys.
E	YOU GUYS!
PARKER	What? What's wrong?
DAN (O.C.)	There's a wolf down here. Lynch and Parker look down. From their POV they can see that
PARKER	Oh shit! Dan doesn't take his eyes off of the wolf. He is shaking in What the hell do I do? WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO??!
D	GET AWAY FROM HIM!!! THWOCK! Parker's snowboard comes down and skids away into
LYNCH	Are you alright man?
X	Yeah. I'm alive.
R	LYNCH See? What did I tell you? They're more scared of you than you are of them. I don't know. I'm pretty scared, I gotta be honest.
LYNCH	It's just a dog. That's all it is.
M	He won't be back.
PARKER	Are you keeping warm down there?
DAN	As warm as I can.
E	I can't feel my legs anymore. Is that bad? I mean, it doesn't hurt as much...but that's bad right?
LYNCH	No, no. You'll be alright. That's probably really bad. I gotta move, so I need you to- looks closely at Parker's face. The tip of her nose and Hey...go like this. motions wiping his face. Ow! It feels like...like sunburn. I'm not an expert but I think that's frost bite.
PARKER	What?
LYNCH	Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere?
PARKER	I don't..I can't see anything. I
D	don't know, it's too dark No! Stop touching it. Don't touch it.
PARKER	But it itches now...
LYNCH	I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off. Just try and cover your face. Try and stay warm. warm is absolutely impossible. Parker hides her
X	You gotta move faster up there.
LYNCH	I'm trying man, I'm trying.
R	slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair, starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chair
PARKER	Careful.
M	LYNCH Stop talking. Lynch. I think the-
LYNCH	DAN, STOP TALKING.

	distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as far I can do this. If Jenny Bluth could climb the rope, I can totally do this. OK. OK. OK.
PARKER	Don't look down.

PARKER	Do you got it?
A	LYNCH Shh.
M	cable clangs somewhere to the front and back of Lynch.
D	two feet out. He looks down for the first time. Oh god.
PARKER	What's wrong?
LYNCH	Please no. Please no...
DAN (O.C.)	Come on, Lynch! You had it! SWISH! His foot slips off of it and he almost falls...but
PARKER	I got you.
X	What's wrong?
R	What happened?
A	her.
LYNCH	Don't look down. What?
LYNCH	Don't look down there, Parker.
D	them...we reveal Dan splayed out on the ground below.
E	Lynch? What's wro-
DAN	Oh shit. Oh shit. LYNCH. YEAH, MAN.
DAN (O.C.)	DON'T LET HER LOOK.
LYNCH	I WON'T.
M	DON'T YOU FUCKING LET HER LOOK.
D	Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead Shhhh. Don't listen to it. Don't listen. Don't listen.
DAN (O.C.)	Don't let her look! Don't look! Don't you fucking look down here!
The sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers	
X	Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep
R	bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain
A	The camera never sees it. Only Lynch and Parker's faces.
M	Silence once again.
E	in the distance, birds take off in fear.
LYNCH	I should...try and... starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again to
PARKER	Why did you let him jump?
X	turns and looks at her in disbelief.
LYNCH	You can't be fucking serious.
R	PARKER It was too far.
LYNCH	He said he could do it. You didn't
A	try and stop him! I can't believe this?! You're blaming me? I'm not...I'm not blaming you.
LYNCH	You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him!
D	He wasn't going to listen to me.
LYNCH	Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I
	said it was too far a drop! But I didn't hear any better ideas out of you except for crying about it! Don't you fucking blame me! You've been his girlfriend, for what? A year maybe? I've known him my whole fucking life!
PARKER	But you... You should have...
LYNCH	What? Say it. Say it! It should have been me?
PARKER	I didn't say that. But you want to! It's OK. I get it. It should have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me, right? feels terrible. She puts her hand on his shoulder.
PARKER	No, no, I- shrugs her hand off of him.
LYNCH	You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass
M	we would have gotten some real runs in and we could have just gone home!
PARKER	I'm sorry. You're sorry? Maybe if you hadn't fucked with our thing... maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into every aspect of his life... maybe my best friend
	wouldn't be dead right now!
PARKER	That's not fair!
LYNCH	And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD!
PARKER	I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! I'm just- I'm just-
LYNCH	-Fuck you. Lynch is numb. He sits expressionless. Seething.

D	They only speak to be speaking.
PARKER	LYNCH 5...5...shit, what was it? 5520?
PARKER	
LYNCH	5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like "Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve. Parker's face is expressionless.
PARKER	Who's gonna pay for the house.
LYNCH	She will. Shannon's got a great
X	job. What does she do.

A	She...an orthodontist.
PARKER	Orthodontists make a lot of money. Yup.

PARKER	Who names their dog "Steve".
LYNCH	I will.
PARKER	Steve's a "people" name.
LYNCH	Says who? You don't like walk into someone's house and have them say "Here's my dog Steve." Why not? Steve's a good name for a dog.
PARKER	"Here, meet my cat Chris."
A	LYNCH No cats. Just a dog. Steve. PARKER Shayna must be so hungry.
LYNCH	What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's?
D	doesn't hear him. As she continues, wet snow starts The poor thing. She's just a puppy. She won't understand that I died. She's gonna think I left her. That I forgot about her. All she wants is for me to come home. She's probably waiting by the door for me right now. Every sound she hears in the hallway she's probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if I'm going to walk in. But I won't. I won't ever walk in. And Shayna's going to starve to death. The poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and it's all my fault.
LYNCH	She won't starve to death and you're not going to die.
PARKER	No one else has a key to my place.
X	LYNCH The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She'll be fine.
R	And so will you. So will we.
A	PARKER I would have had Shayna for a year this month. I got her a year ago for Christmas.
LYNCH	I know. But you'll see her again.
PARKER	Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. I want to see my Mom and my Dad. I want to open presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so we can
	eat. She's always late. But she brings all of the desserts. And she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's so good. And after dinner my Dad always passes out on the couch `cause it's his one day off and he's had too much eggnog. And my sister, my Mom, and I watch A Christmas Story until the marathon is over. And that's how you know Christmas is really over. When Ralphie gets his Red Rider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming. It's kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for Christmas again. It's the same routine every year. I just want to see my Mom and Dad.

D	LYNCH I...thought I was dreaming. This. I thought this was a dream.
PARKER	What?
LYNCH	Your frost-bite. It's getting...worse.
PARKER	Really? How bad is it?
LYNCH	Don't. It's bad.
X	PARKER It's not as itchy any more. Just don't touch your face, OK? When we get out of here, we'll get you to a doctor right away and they'll fix it. PARKER You have some dark spots on your face, too.
LYNCH	They'll fix me, too then. Just don't touch it.
D	Well, it's morning. Maybe someone will come up here now.
PARKER	For what? LYNCH I don't know. Mountain maintenance. Besides, when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for us.
PARKER	No one's gonna look for me. I skip class all the time. By the time anyone notices I'm gone I'll be dead.
LYNCH	Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please!
PARKER	Besides. No one knows we're here.
LYNCH	HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!! HELP!!!
X	voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if
R	Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down.
A	doesn't speak. Help me. PARKER Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? What if you're right? What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today?
D	is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just
	LYNCH UP HERE! SOMEONE HELP US!
PARKER	I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute.
LYNCH	If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you.
PARKER	No. I can't.
LYNCH	Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this. PARKER No. I'm fine. LYNCH Alright.
M	An empty lodge.
D	Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side in a As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand They both sleep.
R	Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still
A	LYNCH Hey...hey Parker...
M	Nothing. Parker wake up. What?
LYNCH	Shit, I thought you stopped breathing...
E	He notices her skinned cheek. Her ear tips are now
PARKER	What's wrong?
LYNCH	Nothing.
LYNCH (cont'd)	How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here?
PARKER	Yeah.
X	onto the ground.
R	LYNCH OK. 1...2...3-
A	Parker holds onto his legs tightly. I feel like I gained about 100 pounds overnight. PARKER It was all that pizza talk.
LYNCH	I have no strength. Then don't do this. LYNCH Damn it.
PARKER	Maybe later.
LYNCH	What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength.
PARKER	There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now.
LYNCH	Even if it was a foot deeper- it
X	wouldn't break that fall. I should have just climbed across last night. I had strength. I had adrenaline.
R	PARKER What do you want me to do?
LYNCH	Nothing. Let's sit and do nothing.
A	She reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes. The
M	
D	AHHHH!
PARKER	How come you never have a girlfriend?
LYNCH	How am I supposed to answer that?
PARKER	I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls dig you. But you never stay in a relationship.
LYNCH	I had a serious girlfriend once.
X	PARKER High School doesn't count. No, post-high school. Freshmen year.
PARKER	Who? LYNCH This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. I
M	totally just felt it with her, you know? We were into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool. She was way into Aerosmith. I had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty. How cool is that?
D	What happened?
LYNCH	She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates
	and that stuff you read about.
PARKER	So then... what happened?
LYNCH	Same old shit. No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named "Dean" had left her notes and shit.
PARKER	Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous?
LYNCH	I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention.
X	PARKER So she dumped you for a frat guy? No. I dumped her. We were in the cafeteria, right? And I was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. And I
A	kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing. So I was like, "who are you laughing at?" You know? Like "what the hell is going on?" And she's like, "Dean's making fun of
M	you." So I turn around, and I'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making eyes with my
D	girlfriend...but I couldn't see him.
PARKER	That's messed up. LYNCH I've never felt so stupid and bad in my life. So I left.
PARKER	You just walked out?
LYNCH	Yup. Told her to go laugh with "Dean the Frat guy". I was out.
PARKER	That sucks.
LYNCH	Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I
X	screwed up.
PARKER	You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that. LYNCH I can't. She's dating Dean.
A	has fought it's way to the surface again. Parker and
M	a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears.
PARKER	I should have done something.
LYNCH	There was nothing either of us could have done.
D	PARKER I sat here and let him die.
	No, you didn't. We didn't let him die. There was nothing we could have done. He jumped down there to try and save us, OK?
PARKER	He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry.
LYNCH	Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little... laughs. Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass. And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying
R	like a total pussy.
PARKER	Sounds like Dan. LYNCH You have no idea. But then, the teacher... Mrs... What was her name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying. And so she
M	says, "Well Dan, is there anyone else in the class that you know?" You know, like, "Maybe there's a friend you'd like to sit with?" And the fucker points right at me and says "him"! I had never seen this kid before in my life, you know? But for whatever reason, he
D	points right at me.
PARKER	And so he had to sit with you?
	LYNCH For a week! For my whole first week of school I'm sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass! Douchebag. I never let him forget it.
PARKER	I loved him so much. But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit.
PARKER	Yes. LYNCH So I need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit. We're gonna get out of this
R	for Dan. Alright?
PARKER	Yes. Lynch bites his severely chapped lips.
LYNCH	Help me up. OK....let's try this again.
E	metal is bending with a light squeaking sound.
PARKER	Are you OK? Do you have it?
LYNCH	Rrruh! his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at an
