ADAM,	I'm completely in -love with someone, and I'm brainstorming ways that I can never see her again without ruining my life.',
ALVIN	How'd.you get so screwed up? Oh yeah.-I did it.
ADAM	I'm just like you- I'm going to fuck it all up. Like you. -Like you gave up on Mom.
ALVIN	When ' we -first , had you, we hadn't slept in days, we were just shoving' food in our mouths over the sink whenever we could. And finally, I got it together enough to get. some take-out from one of the -restaurants we used to like.
ALVIN (CONT'D)	And I set it all out on,the table, and the second we sat down, I think it was the first bite I took, you started crying. And your Horn and I looked at each-other-and just
STARTED-LAUGHING- LIKE	uncontrollably laughing., We're on the floor, we can't breathe.. that kind of laughing. I'm pretty sure that was the best of moment of my life'. If, you rre not Counting anything with a blowjob.
ADAM.	So why'd-you start dicking around?'. Why'd you leave her?
ALVIN	I don't know. I-think the. simplest answer is: I'm a jerk. And--the. other answer is: Because - at -some point, we forgot how to make each other laugh.. And if that-sounds like a bullshit answer, you're probably right. But if it 'sounds really deep, then - that-'s, good too. Alto.-just FYI- the first time I cheated .oft.' your mom, I. was on a lot of blow. So. if you're married and you. do blow, try to avoid-being -around women who wantto_fuck.you. Even fat women. Blow is-blind, Adam, blow is blind. You're an asshole.
ALVIN	But you're not. Call her.
