YOUNG PEOPLE	I'm doing my part... Me, too... Are you ?
OFFICIAL VOICE	Join the mobile infantery and save the world ! Service guarantees citizen-ship. Would you like to know more ? past an observation ship.
OFFICIAL VOICE	The Bugs send another meteor our way !
OFFICIAL VOICE	But this time we are ready ! Planetary defenses are better than ever ! Would you like to know more ?
Klendathu, a fierce orange planet ringed by an asteroid belt,	orbits a double star.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks, orbits a twin star system whose brutal gravitational forces produce an unlimited supply of meteorites... relationship to the BUG PLANETARY SYSTEM and Klendathu.
OFFICIAL VOICE	To ensure the safety of our solar system, Klendathu must be eliminated ! Would you like to know more ? LIVE BROADCAST -- FROM ORBIT - THE INVASION OF KLENDATHU ! Graphics: KLENDATHU: THE INVASION
OFFICIAL VOICE	We break net now and take you live to Klendathu the invasion has begun ! POWER SUITS as they move up the line, the pans to the NET CORRESPONDENT
NET CORRESPONDENT	We 've just landes here on whar cap troopres are calling "Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery division... It 's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we iGKKKKKK ! The CAMERA catches a glimpse of HUGE CLAWS as Cap Trooper JOHNNY RICO , 18, blows away SOMETHING BIG big with his pulse cannon.
JOHNNY	Com'on, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE LEVY, 19, and KITTEN SMITH, 18. The CAMERA pauses, unsure. FOLLOW THEM...! GO ! GO ! Cap Troopers scream as they are torn apart right and left by an enemy seen only in disorientating glimpses.
JOHNNY	THIS WAY ! Something slices Kitten Smith, and he goes down screaming.
JOHNNY	KITTEN !
JOHNNY	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! We glimpse the hideous jaws of an ARACHNID WARRIOR.
CAMERAMAN (O.S.)	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! from the mouth, crawls into CAMERA, trying to get away from the dark INSECT SHAPES that close in on him.
JOHNNY	Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me... Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her. The end of another school year, and for me no doubt another failure... Rico, pay attention ! displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused.
JOHNNY	Sorry, Mr. Rasczak. a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.
RASCZAK	Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? LANNY It's a reward... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service.
RASCZAK	No. Something given has no value ! Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential... Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.
RASCZAK	When you vote, you're exercising political authority. You're using force. And force, my friends, is violence, the supreme authority from which all other authority derives.
CARL	Gee, we always thought you were the supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.
RASCZAK	In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by degree. The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it.
DIZZY	My mother always says that violence never solves anything.
RASCZAK	Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that. You.
CARMEN	They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed. across the way on Carmen's screen.
RASCZAK	Correct. Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor. The contrary opinion 'violence never solves anything' is wishful thinking at its worst. smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.
RASCZAK	People who forget that always pay... They pay with their lives and their freedom.
Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.	So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump, snaps Johnny to.
RASCZAK	You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
JOHNNY	The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
RASCZAK	The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
JOHNNY	Uh, I don't know.
RASCZAK	Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
RASCZAK	Well, that's it. Have a nice life. tries to take Carmen's hand, but she demurs. Johnny broods.
CARMEN	C'mon, let's see if they've posted the math final test yet.
STUDENT	Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ?
JOHNNY	How should I know ?
STUDENT	You're captain of the team !
CARMEN	First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores. Wish me luck !
JOHNNY	Good for you.
CARMEN	Your turn...
CARMEN	Hold on... I wanna talk to Marco. His sister's at Fleet ! makes sure no none else has seen. Carl walks up to him.
CARL	You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
JOHNNY	What's the hurry ?
CARL	Others are waiting.
JOHNNY	Did you read her mind ?
CARL	Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
JOHNNY	Yeah, but I want Carmen.
CARL	You got it bad.
CARL	He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss.
CARMEN	She's flying starships !
JOHNNY	Who ?
CARMEN	Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
JOHNNY	I have good reflexes. like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm.
CARMEN	C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology. other students gather around covered lab tables.
BIOLOGY TEACHER	For our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. You may begin. centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection.
CARMEN	Eeuch !
JOHNNY	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
BIOLOGY TEACHER	Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society.
JOHNNY	Better put your goggles on. fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.
BIOLOGY TEACHER	Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.
CARMEN	But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel.
BIOLOGY TEACHER	True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society. common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR.
BIOLOGY TEACHER	They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space. open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out.
JOHNNY	Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
CARMEN	Excuse me...!
JOHNNY	35% on the math final ! No one could be that dumb with numbers.
CARMEN	Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
JOHNNY	Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
CARMEN	Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
JOHNNY	Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
CARMEN	I don't want everyone to see.
JOHNNY	Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
CARMEN	How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
JOHNNY	It's all I think about anymore. about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand.
CARMEN	You can't walk me home.
JOHNNY	Why not ?
CARMEN	I thought you were going to help Carl.
JOHNNY	Carl can wait.
CARMEN	Johnny, my Dad's home today.
JOHNNY	What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
CARMEN	It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
JOHNNY	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
CARMEN	Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? Johnny grins, happy to be in love. basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card, the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.
CARL	Don't think about it... go on instinct.
JOHNNY	Ace of spades. Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds.
CARL	Statistically speaking you should've accidentally right by know.
JOHNNY	In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
CARL	Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't. Federal studies like this might provide a clue.
JOHNNY	I wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking. Four of spades. the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold.
CARL	Cyrano, you big yellow turd !
JOHNNY	He just wants attention. You don't play with him like you used to.
CARL	Go bug Mom, Cyrano. a time. Carl clears the screen.
JOHNNY	How do you make him do that ?
CARL	I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
MOM (O.S.)	Get out ! Get out ! CARL...!
JOHNNY	Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me.
CARL	Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet. C'mon let's go.
JOHNNY	Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D; ?
CARL	Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
JOHNNY	I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
CARL	Your father will never let you.
JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
CARL	Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
JOHNNY	Eight point... no, uh, seven...
CARL	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
JOHNNY	All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
CARL	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
JOHNNY	Queen of hearts. It is the Queen of hearts.
CARL	Well, what do you know about that ! The SCOREBOARD says: REGIONAL FINAL. Across the field, fans wear red and gold and sing another song. suit up in their orange and black uniforms.
DIZZY	Tesla's tough. They tumble good and they hit HARD. suit up in red and gold.
JOHNNY	We tumble good, too. high in the air over the Giant defensive line, makes ten meters before he is down. Johnny has seen her among all the people.
DIZZY	Kick three, fade left. On two. handsome, super-confident, to guard Johnny.
ZANDER	Time's running out. three minutes and counting on the clock. Johnny grins.
JOHNNY	A lot can happen in three minutes.
DIZZY	Hut... hut ! hurls himself at Johnny, misses. Johnny scores. Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe.
CARMEN	Are you alright ?
ZANDER	I'm getting better. 21-20. Johnny frowns when he sees Carmen talking to Zander on the sidelines, shaking his head, smiling.
ZANDER	So what are you doing later ?
CARMEN	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
ZANDER	I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
CARMEN	You're going to the Academy ? That's where I want to go. I'd love to talk to you abou that.
ZANDER	I'm all ears.
CARMEN	Don't you have to finish the game ?
JOHNNY	Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
ZANDER	You can never be sure. She waves, smiling. The Giants pull ablitz.
DIZZY	WATCH THE BLITZ...! TIGERS 21, GIANTS 22 and less than a minute to go. because Zander's back talking to Carmen again.
DIZZY	Flip six, three hole. Rico ? Hey !
JOHNNY	What ?
DIZZY	You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
JOHNNY	Just throw me the ball, Diz. Johnny broadly. Johnny doesn't grin back.
DIZZY	Hut ! it, trips Zander up painfully, and hurls himself into the end zone as a horn sounds the game's finish. Tigers do flips in the air. Giants look dejected. Zander picks himself up, watches Johnny leave with Carmen. for the big dance. His MOTHER catches him preening in front of a mirror by the TRANSPORTER in the hall.
MOTHER	Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
JOHNNY	Aw, don't get mushy.
FATHER	This came for you today. I presume on your request.
JOHNNY	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
MOTHER	You aren't thinking of applying...?
FATHER	Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
JOHNNY	It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
MOTHER	Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
FATHER	Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
JOHNNY	Mr. Rasczak.
FATHER	Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
JOHNNY	No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
FATHER	Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
FATHER	is that how it is ?
MOTHER	Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
JOHNNY	Uh, no.
FATHER	A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
JOHNNY	Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
MOTHER	Good good, then it's all settled.
FATHER	A year at Harvard and you'll see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives. Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
FATHER	Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
JOHNNY	I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
MOTHER	Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
JOHNNY	Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
MOTHER	Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
FATHER	Teenagers !
BAND LEADER	Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so let's turn down the lights and make it a slow one. standing alone near the dance floor.
DIZZY	Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
JOHNNY	Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
DIZZY	Too bad for her if she's not around.
DIZZY	You know, it's sad... Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight.
JOHNNY	You still gonna play for Brazil ?
DIZZY	Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
JOHNNY	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
DIZZY	How come we never got together ? the room, stunning in her formal.
JOHNNY	Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
DIZZY	Sure.
JOHNNY	
DIZZY	Guess you gotta go.
JOHNNY	You're the best. his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with. Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly.
JOHNNY	Isn't it great to be in love ?
CARMEN	How do I know if this is love ?
JOHNNY	It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
CARL	Outa the way you two ! Johnny goes in for the kiss again.
CARMEN	Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
JOHNNY	Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet. but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak.
JOHNNY	Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
CARMEN	I'll meet you outside.
JOHNNY	Mister Rasczak ?
RASCZAK	What is it, Rico ?
JOHNNY	I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
RASCZAK	Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
JOHNNY	I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
RASCZAK	Good for you. Go find out.
JOHNNY	Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
RASCZAK	Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico. uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee. Carmen examines his FLEET PIN, a pair of silver wings.
CARMEN	Johnny, this is Zander.
ZANDER	Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
JOHNNY	None at all... We won.
CARMEN	Good luck at the academy.
ZANDER	Always.
CARMEN	He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
JOHNNY	Yeah, sure, I guess.
CARMEN	No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
JOHNNY	What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
CARMEN	Zander is going for pilot, too.
JOHNNY	You two have so much in common.
CARMEN	Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
JOHNNY	I can't help it.
CARMEN	He's nothing like you.
JOHNNY	I don't even know if you're my girl.
CARMEN	Are you the boy for me ?
JOHNNY	I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service. breathless.
CARMEN	Oh, Johnny... including a POLICEMAN.
CARMEN	Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
JOHNNY	Who cares ?
CARMEN	You're right. Let's never stop...
POLICEMAN	Hey, you, there's a place for that !
JOHNNY	I love you, Carmen.
CARMEN	Shhh...
CARMEN'S DAD	Carmen, it's late. Get inside.
CARMEN	Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny. battle scar oon his face.
CARMEN'S DAD	I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ?
JOHNNY	Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from now on, Mr. Ibanez.
CARMEN'S DAD	Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you and your rich family. The Federation'll give her everything she needs. Dad, leave him alone... citizens file through the main doors.
RECRUITING SERGEANT	Fresh meat for the grinder, eh ?
CARL	That's us. Where do we sign ? smiles even wider.
RECRUITING SERGEANT	Here and here and here. chest. We hear MUSIC: "The Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays softly in honor of distant battles.
RECRUITING SERGEANT	Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service. Follow the blue line. A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker.
COLONEL	There is no guarantee of service. We don't need all of you. It costs a great deal to train human beings for useful tasks. Many jobs are hazardous to your health. If you are chosen and do not wish to serve you may resign at anytime simply by completing form 1240/A. Thank you for exercising you constitutonal rights. DON, 18, athletic and cheerful.
DON	They took my sister, they'll take anybody. his side, drawing fluids.
DON	Oh, this is the part that hurts !
PSYCH OFFICER	No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
JOHNNY	Here in Buenos Aires. stimuli, and scanned from head to toe.
PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)	Are your parents currently citizens ? No, sir. Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ? Courage, I guess. Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because... I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
MAJOR	I'm happy to tell you that you've been accepted for Federal Service.
JOHNNY	Wow, that's great.
MAJOR	Looks like you're quite an athlete. Boy, look at those reaction stats. MOBILE INFANTERY.
MAJOR	My job is to dertermine what you're best suited for.
JOHNNY	I want to be a pilot, sir.
MAJOR	Sorry, son, no way. Your school records say you don't have the math skills. "Pilot" from the list, then several other items.
MAJOR	That rules out the scientific and engineering applications, and I'm afraid we reserve non-military options for candidates who are frankly less able-bodied than you are, son... The only thing left is MOBILE INFANTERY.
MAJOR	It looks like the only thing you're good for is cannon fodder. I'm putting you down for the Mobile Infantery. a gleaming silver FLEET PIN on her chest. She looks around for Johnny, sees him grinning at her.
JOHNNY ET AL	...of my own free will, without promise, coercion, or inducement, after having been duly advised and warned of the meaning and consequence of this oath, do now enroll in the Federal Service of the Terran Federation for not less than two years and as much longer as may be required by the needs of the Service...
CARMEN	I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
JOHNNY	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
JOHNNY	He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
CARMEN	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse. and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on. He grins when he sees them staring.
RECRUITING SERGEANT	They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted, but at the end of the day I go home. How'd you kids do ?
CARMEN	I'm gonna go for pilot.
RECRUITING SERGEANT	Good for you. We need every pilot we can get. Suddenly Carl appears looking a little paler than usual.
CARMEN	Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
JOHNNY	Did you get Starside R&D; ?
CARL	No.
JOHNNY	I don't believe it !
CARL	I got Games & Theory.
CARMEN	Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
JOHNNY	Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
RECRUITING SERGEANT	Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute you. What about you, son ?
JOHNNY	Infantery, sir.
RECRUITING SERGEANT	Well, good for you. The Mobile Infantery made me the man I am today. away. MUSIC: "The Mobile Infantery Theme". Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the arm as they walk.
CARMEN	Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
JOHNNY	I'll go for that.
CARL	Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away from each other, and chances are we'll never see each other again, but sure...
CARMEN	I can't wait to tell my Dad I'm in. He's gonna be so happy !
JOHNNY	My father's probably gonna kill me.
FATHER	You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
JOHNNY	I won't quit !
FATHER	I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
JOHNNY	I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
FATHER	You walk out that door, you're cut off, young man... You understand me ?
MOTHER	Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
JOHNNY	Well, yeah, sure...
MOTHER	I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
JOHNNY	Don't talk about my girl that way.
looks for Carmen among hundreds of young people bound for	Federal Service destinations. Recruits wear civilian clothes. Everyone else is in uniform. Outbound group 1380, Ursa Minor and Tyko, now transporting at bank 17... help her and soon he is carrying all her bags.
JOHNNY	You're late.
CARMEN	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. numbered tags for her bags.
JOHNNY	Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own.
CARMEN	Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
JOHNNY	Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
CARMEN	You talk to Carl ?
JOHNNY	He left this morning. He couldn't say where. FLEET ACADEMY. The tickets station spits out a pass.
CARMEN	It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it. Going someplace new where you don't anyone. takes her by the arms.
JOHNNY	I'm gonna miss you.
CARMEN	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
JOHNNY	I love you. Outbound group 948A, Tereshkova, all sections, transporting at bank 5.
CARMEN	Oh, that's me.

OFFICIAL VOICE	Disregarding Federal warnings, Mormon extremists established Port Joe Smith, a settlement of 300 on Tango Urilla, a system just inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. multiple eyes, cutting mouthparts and claws. Wary SCIENTISTS keep their distance as it eats a COW.

ZIM	I am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim. TO THINK THIS HAD TO HAPPEN TO ME ! What a bunch of apes. No, strike that. You don't rate that good...you sunken-chested, slack-bellied, drooling refugees from apron strings ! In my whole life I've never seen such a disgraceful huddle of momma's spoiled little darlings ! Suck in those guts ! You there, EYES FRONT !
ZIM	Do you think I'm funny ? Do I make you laugh ? Do you think I'm a comedian ?

DIZZY	Sir, I heard it was the best, sir ! It is the best... BUT WHAT MAKES YOU YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH ? YOUR BELLY AND GIVE ME RECRUIT ! MEDICS arrive and go to work on Ace's hand. meat on the bottom, ice cream on top.
ACE	I'd like to disable Zim...!
KATRINA	Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out for talking like that...
DJANA'D	They can kick you out for anything. Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory Performance...
KITTEN SMITH	Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye !
ACE	Aw, you either got what it takes or you don't.
DJANA'D	C'mon Ace, wait your turn !
ACE	At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck.
JOHNNY	Better get in line like everyone else, Ace. with interest. Ace opens his hand.
ACE	You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
JOHNNY	What an honor...
ACE	Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
BRECKINRIDGE	Come on, Ace, back off the line ! Bacl off the line ! Johnny has his grub. Dizzy comes up with her tray.
DIZZY	Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
JOHNNY	No thanks, Diz.
DIZZY	What's your malfunction, Rico ?
JOHNNY	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
DIZZY	What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
JOHNNY	You saying you didn't ? the pack , breathing hard, Johnny and Ace race.
ACE	What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Something... I've got...you don't.
ACE	You rich kids... are all the same !
JOHNNY	It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
DIZZY	Coming through !
ZIM	C'mon, move it, you apes !
KITTEN SMITH	We all have one thing in common. We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infanterie. What's your excuse, Breckinridge ?
BRECKINRIDGE	Well, my family is all farmers. I hate farming. Mobile Infantery's pure picnic by comparison.
KITTEN SMITH	So the grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, eh ? Djana'd ?
DJANA'D	I'm going in for politics. You gotta be a citizen for that. So here I am.
KITTEN SMITH	C'mon, keep it going... Katrina !
KATRINA	I wanna be a mom. It's easier to get a licence if you've served.
ACE	I'm going career... officer's training. That's why I wanna be squad leader. They look for that.
JOHNNY	Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
ACE	Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
JOHNNY	Well, maybe you better look again.
SHUJUMI	Federation's gonna give me a scholarship when my hitch is up. I wanna be a neurologist, study brain chemisty and associated stimulus... She has a fabulous body. Dizzy cathes Johnny looking. He turns his back as she steps into the shower next to him.
KITTEN SMITH	Your turn, Rico !
JOHNNY	Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ?
KITTEN SMITH	Me, I got plans to be writer, and a writer's got a right to be nosey. Flores, you know Rico from Buenos Aires... What's his story ?
DIZZY	Well, some say he turned his back on the family fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for a girl... missed a spot there, bucko... which is funny because Johnny says I joined up to be with him, but why would I do that ? He doesn't even like me.
BRECKINRIDGE	Don't look that way to me. blushes, grabs a towel and exits the shower. lounging around in their skivvies.
JOHNNY	I know it's not much, but it's home. Over there's my bunk where I dream about you every night... camera.
JOHNNY	Hey, do you mind ? shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame.
KATRINA	Hey, what's going on ?
DIZZY	I bet it's that girl I was talking about... Her name's Carmen, I think.
ACE AND THE OTHERS	Carmen ! Ooh la la, Carmencita !
KATRINA	Hi, Carmen !
ACE AND THE OTHERS	Hey, where you going ? Come back...! He's getting awy... Grab him...!
JOHNNY	Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes I think I won't make it, but then I imagine you're watching me, and that gives me someting... I try harder. Thanks to you, I think I might have a shot at squad leader. Johnny lowers his voice.
JOHNNY	Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you're having fun, hope you're careful. No training accidents for you, eh ? I want to kiss you so badly. I want to feel you next to me, I-
ACE	I love you truly, so truly, dear...! over the door, giggling, delighted with themselves.
ACE	Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
JOHNNY	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys ! arm as she runs by in a sleek blue pressure suit.
BALD CADET	Orbit in five, Ibanez ! First one there gets to fly ! second seat.
CARMEN	Looking it down !
LATE CADET	Oh no, not Ibanez again, she's crazy !
CARMEN	On my mark, in three, two, one...
straeks upward from the lunar floor past orbitting training platforms where	CADETS in brightly colored pressure suits float against the Earth which hangs beyond the horizon. ...GO ! and other slower fleet traffic in the crowded space lanes of Luna. The two late cadets are terrified.
BALD CADET	Geez, I thought I liked to fly fast !
CARMEN	This is nothing. Today, I get to fly that !
CARMEN	Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
DELADIER	Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
CARMEN	Yes, ma'am ! Zander Barcalow, now a 2nd Lieutenant.
CARMEN	Hey ! What are you doing here ?
ZANDER	I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
CARMEN	Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
ZANDER	Only when I give you an order.
DELADIER	Prepare for departure.
CARMEN	It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
ZANDER	Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
DELADIER	Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
CARMEN	Yes, ma'am.
CARMEN	In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
ZANDER	This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
CARMEN	Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
ZANDER	Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed. away from the dense orbiting yards os Luna toward the outer system.
CARMEN	Or...?
ZANDER	They revoke our flight status.
CARMEN	Oh, I see... teamwork.
DELADIER	Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
ZANDER	Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one... blur together, becoming one, then: WHAM ! Breckinridge, and Djana'd. Johnny, Shujumi, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy are part of BLUE TEAM.
ZIM	The object of this exercise is to capture your enemy's flag before your enemy captures yours.
ZIM	These weapons have been modified for this exercise. If your enemy hits you, your suit will fail. You will be unable to move. You will be as good as dead. flag guarded by two recruits. She jumps down to joining other Red Team members on the move.
DJANA'D	It's right over the next ridge... Only two guards. Djana'd and the others collapse as their suits fail, Djana'd laughing because playing at war seems funny.
KITTEN SMITH	You are now prisoners of the Blue Team. Tell us your plans or die !
DJANA'D	Oh no ! Name, rank, and mind your own business is all you get from me ! go down in an ambush led by Breckinridge. Johnny dives for cover, and finds himself sharing it with Dizzy.
KITTEN SMITH	I'm going in ! Let's go ! fire from two new hidden Red Team positions, taking Kitten and his team down with a cross fire.
JOHNNY	Man, they're defended... no way in.
DIZZY	Flip six, three hole.
JOHNNY	What ?
DIZZY	High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
JOHNNY	Cover me.
DIZZY	You got it. as he rises to fire. Johnny lands, knocks out Katrina, then Ace. He picks up Ace's fallen Morita.
JOHNNY	Thanks, pal. Red Team defenders. He grabs the Red Team flag and hurls it into the air like spear.
ZIM	Kid's got some moves... to practice drops from altitude.
ZIM	Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
JOHNNY	Sir, thank you, sir !
ZIM	Don't stand there dumb... GO !
JOHNNY	YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...! that designate him as Squad Leader.
KITTEN SMITH	Look at him. Do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself ?
ACE	Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose, I guess.
JOHNNY	I just want you guys to know that I'll never do anything that I haven't asked you to do first.
JOHNNY	Couldn't've done it without you, Diz. Friends ?
DIZZY	Yeah, sure... friends.
BRONSKI	Levy... Shujumi... Rico.
JOHNNY	Bet it's from my girl. in her quarters aboard starship Athena.
CARMEN	Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every moment here.
ACE	Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that !
JOHNNY	Shhhh...!
CARMEN	I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
JOHNNY	All it takes is the love of a good woman... Saturn sparkle in bright solar light.
CARMEN	Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had to show you. It's great to be out here on my own. I'm just not some little girl from Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the universe... And that's also the problem because I don't really want to get married, Johnny. I don't want to have kids. I want a command, a ship of my own, and you know, I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me. something else to do.
CARMEN	I know that's not what you wanted to hear... but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry. I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me, so I'll know that we'll always be friends. shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder.
ACE	Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
JOHNNY	It's what I deserve.
ACE	Whad'ya talkin about ?
JOHNNY	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
ACE	You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
JOHNNY	Thanks, Ace. Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him. each squad member's power suit.
ZIM	With the Marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME CARE on my firing line. Do you get me ?
RECRUITS	Sir, yes, sir !
ZIM	The live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide. If you do not hit your target, it will shoot you... are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story building facades.
ZIM	The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir ! as the target drones take cover and disappear from view.
ZIM	Perfect score for this exercise is 300. B company came through last week with 285. I expect you to do better. a recruit takes a hit and goes down, immobilized. Djana'd has a clear shot, but Breckinridge gets in her way.
DJANA'D	You're in my line of fire, Breckinridge
JOHNNY	CROSSFIRE ! EVERYBODY DOWN ! Shujumi rises to fire, a round slams him back to the ground. Johnny and Djana'd knock out the two drones.
JOHNNY	Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard. Move out. There is something wrong with his "head up" display.
JOHNNY	What's the problem ?
BRECKINRIDGE	Dunno. Display's fritzed.
DJANA'D	Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up our score... Let me see. Breckinridge. Her "head up" zeroes him.
DJANA'D	How come when something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge ? it discharges. The round tears the top of Breckinridge's head off. The recruits stare in horror.
JOHNNY	Oh, God... uh... MEDIC !
ZIM	Rico, you are relieved of squad command. Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico to the C.O.'s Office. No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing. both saddened by the proceedings.
C.O.	Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir. Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Sir, no, sir.
C.O.	Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
JOHNNY	Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir. You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404. You may, of course, demand trial by court martial.
JOHNNY	Sir, no, sir ! Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
JOHNNY	Sir... I guess I do, sir.
C.O.	Sergeant, we've lost two recruits over this incident already... is there any possibility of salvaging this man ?
Zim	I believe so, sir.
C.O.	Alright. We'll try administrative punishment. Until then you are confined to your quarters, Rico. erected. The recruits look up as Zim enters.
ZIM	Alright, let's go, Rico. leader, watches, feels bad for his pal. strung up as the C.O. reads the charge.
C.O.	For incompetence of command, for failure to abide by safety regulations in a live fire exercise, for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate...
ZIM	Bite on this. It helps. I know.
C.O.	... recruit trainee John Rico is sentenced to administrative punishment. Ten lashes. stands at the post alone. Corporal Bronski, a big man with an unhappy task, unrolls his whip. You may carry out the sentence.
BRONSKI	One. sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece.

BRONSKI	Four.
BRONSKI	Five. and LANDING BOATS lining her open hangar deck. and Carmen.
CARMEN	Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
ZANDER	Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
ZANDER	Profile's wrong... there.
CARMEN	No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
ZANDER	Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
CARMEN	Hey, check it.
ZANDER	You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
CARMEN	Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
ZANDER	Well, whad'ya know...
CARMEN	Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
ZANDER	She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
CARMEN	You and me, huh ? her hand, up her arm and playfully around her breasts.
ZANDER	I have a feeling about us. We're good together, way ahead of the curve in every department. I seem to be able to anticipate your needs. You know what I want...
CARMEN	No, what do you want ? gets serious for amoment.
CARMEN	I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet... Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle. Deladier appears on the hot screen, still waking up.
DELADIER	Report.
ZANDER	Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... WHERE IS IT ?
ZANDER	THERE ! GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
CARMEN	It looks like an... asteroid.
DELADIER	In this part of the system ? ASTEROID tumbles directly towards them at terrific speed.
ZANDER	Sweet Jesus...! within and fires the rockets. in Athena's hull. Ice and rock travelling in ist wake shreds COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. The ship continues to tumble. seal Athena's wound and their fates. rush to their stations. Zander's going through star charts.
DELADIER	Where'd it come from ?
ZANDER	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
DELADIER	Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Communications are down, ma'am.
DELADIER	Engineering. Damage assessment.
ENGINEERING OFFICER	Hull's compromised. We're lucky to be alive, ma'am. CAP TROOPER trails in the wreckage of the flight deck.
DELADIER	Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
CARMEN	Thank you, ma'am. day's training. No one says anything. He moves stiffly, careful of his back.
DIZZY	It stinks, you goin.
JOHNNY	I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
DIZZY	If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
JOHNNY	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
BRONSKI	Your call's going through, Rico. Take it there. His mother appears when she picks up the other end.
MOTHER	Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
JOHNNY	Hi, mom.
MOTHER	Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
FATHER	Johnny ! Where's your uniform...?
FATHER	Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
JOHNNY	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
MOTHER	Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
JOHNNY	I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
FATHER	Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
MOTHER	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
FATHER	Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son. mother looks out the window.
MOTHER	Oh, my, what's that ?
FATHER	Looks like rain.
MOTHER	This time of the year...? TRANSMISSION TERMINATED.
VU-PHONE VOICE	Your transmission has been terminated due to atmospheric interference. Please try your call again later.
JOHNNY	Well, see ya.
DIZZY	You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
JOHNNY	What's that, Diz ?
DIZZY	That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
C.O.	Now you, Sergeant.
C.O.	That's it, son. You can go. out the door. Out across the parade ground he sees the glint of Marauder power suits as recruits tumble the obstacle course. back for one last look and notices people running to the Comminications shack. Kitten Smith runs by.
JOHNNY	Hey, Kitten, what's going on ?
KITTEN	It's war !
OFFICIAL VOICE	... early estimates. Millions dead, a city in ruins...
JOHNNY	Oh, jeez, is that Geneva ?
KATRINA	Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.
OFFICIAL VOICE	... Buenos Aires has been wiped of the Earth. Nothing lives in what was once called the Latin Paradise...
DIZZY	Aw, Johnny, geez... It's home.
OFFICIAL VOICE	The Federal Court met moments ago and voted unanimously for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat. illustrates the insect treachery.
OFFICIAL VOICE	The meteor derived from here, near Klendathu, in the Arachnid's home system...
ZIM	I'm serious, sir. I'll go anywhere. I want combat. Forget it, Zim. We're gonna need you here. The only way you'll get a combat assignment is if you bust yourself to private. You get me ?
ZIM	Yes, sir, I get you. What can I do for you, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir. Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
JOHNNY	Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
ZIM	Is that your signature, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Sir, yes it is, sir.
ZIM	Doesn't look like it to me. of the coming war. Zim tears up the 1240/A.
ZIM	Get outa here, private. people wail, kids play tag in the ruins.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow, then ANGER !
ANGRY PERSON	The only good bug is a dead bug !
OFFICIAL VOICE	Would you like to know more ? weary comrades carry him off the field.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Cap Troopers establish a foothold on Dantana, a planet system at the outer edge of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Casualties are high, but casualties won't stop the Mobile Infantery ! Would you like to know more ? FACTORY WORKERS turn out ordnance. PEOPLE line up to enlist.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Everyone's doing their share. Are you ? The war effort needs your effort at work, at home, in your community. Would you like to know more ?
SKY MARSHALL DIENES	We are a generation commanded by fate to defend humankind ! We must meet the threat with our valor, our blood, with our very lives, to insure that human civilization, not insect, dominates this galaxy now and always.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Sky Marshall Dienes announces plans for an offensive against Klendathu, source of the bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires. where STARSHIPS are stacked in berths. Super title: COUNTDOWN TO VICTORY.
OFFICIAL VOICE	We now break net and take you live to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. MOBILE INFANTERY and FLEET PERSONNEL.
NET CORRESPONDENT	No one here in the AQZ knows when the invasion of Kendathu will occur, but everyone's talking about it, and the talk says tomorrow !
NET CORRESPONDENT	Here's a bunch of M.I. kids who look like they eat bugs for lunch !
DIZZY	Yum, yum yum ...!
NET CORRESPONDENT	So you're not to worried about fighting the Arachnids...?
ACE	Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, lotta dead bugs, am I right ?
KITTEN SMITH	I just hope it's not over before we get in it !
NET CORRESPONDENT	Some say the bugs were provoked by human attempts to colonize within the AQZ, that a "live and let live" policy is preferable to war with the bugs...
JOHNNY	Yeah, well, I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill'em all ! singing and dancing, a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and excitement, but nearby a VETERAN drinks alone.
KITTEN SMITH	That guy's been in it.
JOHNNY	How can you tell ?
KITTEN SMITH	The eyes. He's got the 1000 meters stare. Dizzy eyes his skull and crossbone earring.
ACE	Great scars.
DIZZY	I like the jewelry. Hey, amigo, where can I get an earring like yours ?
VETERAN	Port Joe Smith, Outer Rings, Dantana... Every time I come back from a drop, my gunny gives me a bone. I got three now. You don't see a lot of guys with three.
JOHNNY	Waht's it like... combat ?
VETERAN	I guess it's not so bad. I mean as long as you don't get any on you.
KITTEN SMITH	Get any what on you ?
VETERAN	Oh, you'll know when it happens. See you on the bounce.
ACE	I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
JOHNNY	What do I want with a scar ?
DIZZY	What, your skin's too pretty ? C'mon, everyone's doing it !
CARMEN (V.O.)	Hey Johnny ! Johnny Rico ! the hat and the lieutenant's bars on her shoulders.
JOHNNY	Carmen... ? follow suit. Carmen salutes back, sheepish.
CARMEN	Oh... at ease. Guess I oughta lose the hat when I'm off duty, eh ?
JOHNNY	What happened to your hair ?
CARMEN	What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
JOHNNY	It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
CARMEN	It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
JOHNNY	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
CARMEN	You don't look very happy to see me.
JOHNNY	Should I be ?
CARMEN	Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
ZANDER	Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
CARMEN	Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
ZANDER	Best in the Fleet !
JOHNNY	I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
CARMEN	Johnny, wait...
ZANDER	Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
JOHNNY	You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
ZANDER	You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
JOHNNY	Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers. Fleet on one side, Mobile Infantery on the other.
ZANDER	Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
CARMEN	Zander, please... Let's go ! It's alright. What's he gonna do ? bleeding. Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny.
ACE	Whoa, easy there, buddy... Nice punch.
CARMEN	What's wrong with you ?
JOHNNY	Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Carmen turns away, stung. Johnny immediately regrets. Dizzy,	for her part, couldn't be happier.
DIZZY	Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and Fleet weren't meant to mix ! intricate pattern into his arm.
JOHNNY	It hurts...! Ace pours booze directly into the fresh wound.
ACE	No, this hurts.
JOHNNY	YAAAAAAAA !
KITTEN SMITH	Well, here's to it ! We're gonna fightn, and we're gonna win ! Lightning bolts on a shield and the words: DEATH FROM ABOVE.
ACE	Mobile Infantery rules !
JOHNNY	Death to all bugs !
DIZZY	Don't get any on you ! The "Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays loke Holst, pounding and relentless. The invasion has begun ! wait to drop with other cap troopers. Their mood is grim. LIEUTENANT WILLY, 35, easy-going and confident, enters.
ACE	Officer on deck !
LT. WILLY	At ease. Alright... we got hot poop straight from the top: Willy's Wildcats is in with the first wave. Means more bugs for us to kill...
LT. WILLY	Now if you follow orders and remember your training, I guarantee you'll make it back alive. Any questions ?
LT. WILLY	Alright... next we got a little last minute briefing from Military Intelli-gence I think you're gonna like... captive BUG WARRIOR clicks and shrieks as FEDERAL SCIENTISTS torture it. The troopers cheer.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Everyday Federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs and you can help... Johnny and Dizzy share an amazed grin, noticing a difference in their old friend, something that speaks of... authority.
CARL	To defeat the enemy, we must know the enemy. Take for instance your basic Arachnid warrior. Minimal IQ, armored, completely lethal. You can blow a limb off... The insect screams.
CARL	... and it's still 86% combat effec-tive. But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good. Carl tosses the pulse gun aside.
CARL	Now while you are out killing bugs, we want you to be our eyes and ears. The bugs use some kind of plasma burst to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth. We need to know how they do this. If you encounter any plasma, report it immediately to your superior. Good luck and good hunting !
P.A. (O.S.)	This is the Captain speaking. All personnel prepare for drop.We are at D minus three and counting.
LT. WILLY	Move out ! Dizzy gives him "thumbs up". The capsule seals as it moves with the others down the firing tube. tube. Lt. Willy appears on the "head up" display.
LT. WILLY	Smash the entire area, kill anything that has more'n a couple legs , and don't any of you loafers come back aboard with unexpended bombs. Get me ?
JOHNNY ET AL	Yes, sir ! Five seconds... We move down the line past Mannerheim, Dauntless, George Marshall, and Yamamoto to the Rodger Young. rips past the starboard bow.
CARMEN	Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
DELADIER	Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
ZANDER	Drop is 35% complete, ma'am.
DELADIER	Steady as she goes, Number 1.
GUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.)	...surface in twenty-fivr seconds ...LZ has been identified ...beacon is in place... battle group. Below, the surface of Klendathu fairly bistles with outgoing defensive fire.
DELADIER	This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
ZANDER	That's it, we're empty ma'am ! and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn.
DELADIER	Someone made a big goddam mistake ! Get us out of here, Number 1 ! and then KA-WHAM ! they're hit. Carmen flies out of her station and into CAMERA hard.
GUIDANCE COMPUTER (V.O.)	...surface in fifteen seconds... deploying chute now... of cap troopers in ordered rows drifting down into the cloud layer. It's quiet in the clouds, then: out of the ground to defend against the invader. ...surface in five... four ... three... on the bounce. None of it compares to the sound of his own racing HEARTBEAT. Lieutenant Willy shouts.
LIEUTENANT WILLY	Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions from theAAAAAAAA ! wings for gliding) lands on Lieutenant Willy and cracks his head like a nut.
ACE	KILL IT ! gushing.
JOHNNY	Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
ACE	I didn't see him ! and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS.
KITTEN SMITH	Here they come...!
DIZZY	Ace, what're we doing ?
ACE	I uh... uh... in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects.
SHUJUMI	You want some ? Here's some ! C'MON !
JOHNNY	Don't waste your ammon on the workers ! into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs.
SHUJUMI	AAAAAAAAAAAA !
KATRINA	Let's get out of here ! lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes.
DIZZY	Look out ! from under her.
KATRINA	AAAAAAAAAAAAA !
JOHNNY	C'mon, Katrina was right. We gotta get out of here ! to be churning with insects as more and more bugs come to the surface to repel the invasion.
JOHNNY	It's a general retreat ! The boats are coming down. CAMERAMAN are doing live coverage of the invasion.
NET CORRESPONDENT	We've just landed here on what cap troopers are calling the "Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery Division. It's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we kow iGKKKKK !
JOHNNY	C'mon, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE ! streaks acroos thr sky.
KITTEN SMITH	I can see the beacon...!
ACE	Retrieval !
JOHNNY	KITTEN ! right through Johnny's thigh.
JOHNNY	AAAAAAAAAAAAA !
DIZZY	Johnny ! JOHNNY ! WHERE ARE YOU ? JOHNNY ! Johnny...! down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes.
JOHNNY	Medic... MEDIC...!
Now two more Arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping	smoke. He fires his pulse rifle empty, and dropping it, crawls desperately, dragging his useless leg.
JOHNNY	Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me...! toward him, when suddenly it is blown to pieces in the blinding blast of a point-blank pulse cannon.
VOICE (O.S.)	Take my hand ! attack. His rescuers's pulse cannon thunders overhead. Bug parts fly as insects swarm in for the kill. drenched plains of Klendathu.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Crsisis for Humankind ! Fleet official admit they underestimated the Arachnid's defensive capability. Would you like to know more ? bfore a gathering of the Federal Council.
OFFICIAL VOICE	Accepting responsibility for Klendathu, Sky Marshall Dienes resigns. His successor, Sky Marshall Tahat Meru, outlines her new strategy.
SKY MARSHALL MERU	Until we understand the bug better, we must proceed with caution... We can ill afford another Klendathu. Arachnid species topped by a QUESTION MARK.
OFFICIAL VOICE	To explain the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids, Federal Scientists postulate the existence of a leadership caste...BRAIN BUGS !
OFFICIAL VOICE	Families oof those who have died or become incapacitated by Federal Service are entitled to benefits ! If you see the name of a loved one, please do not call. A Federation official will call you. Would you like to know more ? she flies inverted. Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young requesting approach vector... Affirmative, Rodger Young...one zero zero niner five two... welcome back. CARMEN docks of Ticonderoga.
CARMEN	You know, we're lucky to be alive. Zander and Carmen make their way up the steep companionway beside the ghastly conveyer belt.
ZANDER	Give me hand, willya ?
ZANDER	I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
CARMEN	You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
ZANDER	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
CARMEN	There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
ZANDER	So ?
CARMEN	So who's got time to get married ? onto the conveyer belt, finds himself eyeball-to-eyeball with a horribly maimed trooper, scrambles to get off. with wounded awaiting triage. Survivors watch casualty lists scroll ba on a Federal Net terminal.
ZANDER	Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
CARMEN	Funny...
ZANDER	I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
CARMEN	No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
ZANDER	Hey, bugs don't take prisoners. MORE ? She bites her lip, enters Johnny's name. In an instant, she has the news: RICO, JOHN D. - KIA
CARMEN	Oh no.
ZANDER	Carmen...?
CARMEN	Excuse me...!
ZANDER	I'm sorry, Carmen.
CARMEN	Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
CARMEN	No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
ZANDER	You're upset, that's alright.
CARMEN	No, don't you see ? No one can wait for anything anymore... You're right... We should get married... A low underwater KNOCKING wakes him. He opens his eyes and sees Ace and Dizzy outside the tank.
DIZZY	Two more days. arms culture layers of new tissue. Johnny gives a weak thumbs up. The knocking sound continues.
ACE	Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
JOHNNY	He was our teacher... He was great.
ACE	Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
DIZZY	The Roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit in 2nd Brigade... Only took 15% casualties on Big K. big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.
JOHNNY	Seeing as how we're about all that's left of 1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement. You top kick ?
SUGAR WATKINS	Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
JOHNNY	I wouldn't mind.
BIRDIE	I would. Nice earring.
DIZZY	Where you been besides Big K ?
BIRDIE	Outer rings. Zegema Beach.
JOHNNY	I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
SUGAR WATKINS	Good luck. It's not there anymore.
ACE	Is your Lieutenant as bad as they say ?
BIRDIE	No one talks about the Lieutenant that way. He saved my life !
SUGAR WATKINS	Mine, too.
OTHER ROUGHNECKS	Same for me... me, too...
ACE	Sounds like he is quite a guy.
GILLESPIE	Attention !
RASCZAK	This is for you new people. I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me ?
JOHNNY, DIZZY AND ACE	We get you, sir !
RASCZAK	Get rid of the jewelry. I hate it. Welcome to the Roughnecks.
BIRDIE	Rasczak's Roughnecks !
RASCZAK	Alright. There's a new Sky Marshall and a new plan. We're gonna clean out the systems outlying Klendathu one planet at a time. Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla. After Fleet glasses the planet, M.I. mops up. endless line of WORKERS enter bearing foodstuff appropriate to this exotic jungle planet. FIGHTERS screams down from high orbit and a white hot nuclear firestorm burns consumes the landscape. Roughnecks.
RASCZAK	Spread out, teams of three. When you locate a bug hole, secure it, gas it, and close it. Ace spots a bug hole where workers and warrors have broken through the glassed surface.
ACE	There. Johnnx and Ace step over burning bug carcasses to the rim of the hole and fire their gas rounds.
JOHNNY	Fire in the hole ! the entrance to the bug city. You new guys over there... WE could use some help... overrun when Johnny touches down wuth Ace and Dizzy.
JOHNNY	Looks like you've got a little bug problem, ma'am...
BIRDIE	Stow it, trooper. Give it verything you've got ! crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a TANKER BUG.
JOHNNY	WATCH OUT ! an arm, screaming.
BIRDIE	AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! pulse cannon.
RASCZAK	Sugar, in for pick up ! The big bug explodes.
RASCZAK	Gas that hole and close it ! beside Rasczak.
RASCZAK	Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
JOHNNY	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
RASCZAK	I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better. to meet an arriving skimmer.
RASCZAK	Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes with a factory guarantee !
DIZZY	Way to go, amigo !
JOHNNY	I'm gonna need a squad leader.
ACE	No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
JOHNNY	What about it, Diz ?
DIZZY	Looks like I'm your girl, sir. from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air. Flaming debris rains down.
RASCZAK	Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's our trash ! pit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving.
JOHNNY	What kind of stinkin' bug is that ? translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery.
SUGAR WATKINS	You never seen how they do it before ? plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.
ACE	Agghh ! It's making me sick...! yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.
SUGAR WATKINS	It's gonna pop ! streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew.
GILLESPIE	Sir, look !
RASCZAK	We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
GILLESPIE	Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
RASCZAK	Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
GILLESPIE	Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
RASCZAK	They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
DIZZY	That'd be me, sir.
RASCZAK	Heat it up.
RASCZAK	Roughnecks, you may fire at will.
DIZZY	I'm hot, sir !
RASCZAK	FIRE ! BLAST SHIELDS DOWN !
RASCZAK	HIT THE DIRT ! returns Johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the bug battery.
GILLESPIE	Now comes the part I hate the most.
JOHNNY	What's that ?
GILLESPIE	We go down into the colony and make sure all the queens are dead. every turn and kill them. Helmet lamps make weird shadows of dead bugs piled everywhere along the way.
SUGAR WATKINS	You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
JOHNNY	He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
SUGAR WATKINS	Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
JOHNNY	Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared. guarding the entrance of a large chamber. and though she is herself dying, her abdomen, rippled by life within, continues to undulate.
JOHNNY	All dead except one, sir.
RASCZAK	Kill the bitch.
JOHNNY	Yes, sir. wriggling premature bugs come spilling out. Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire. Roughnecks eat. Rasczak stands, banging a spoon on his mess kit.
RASCZAK	Tango Urilla is now bug free. Means the Roughnecks have killed a helluva lotta bugs...! rool out. He kicks open a second module. Inside, musical instruments. Ace picks up a violin.
RASCZAK	I expect the best, but I give the best. Habve some fun. That's an order ! Dizzy tries to pull Johnny into the fun.
DIZZY	C'mon...
JOHNNY	Nah, I don't do that anymore...
DIZZY	You used to dance...
JOHNNY	I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
DIZZY	Well, excuse me, sir... with an odd, sad smile.
RASCZAK	Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
JOHNNY	Yes, sir...
RASCZAK	Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
GILLESPIE	Lieutenant, Brigade's on the com...
JOHNNY	Hey, Diz...
DIZZY	What ?
JOHNNY	May I have the honor ?
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
RASCZAK	I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
RASCZAK	Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
RASCZAK	My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
VOICE (O.S.)	That'll be all, Major. Dismissed. Rasczak's jaw drops. It's his former student Carl Jenkins, now a Colonel, weary and pissed off.
CARL	This conference is over. Do your duty, Lieutenant. That's an order.
RASCZAK	Yes, sir.
RASCZAK	Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
JOHNNY	Yes, sir !
RASCZAK	Who's that with you ?
RASCZAK	Report in ten minutes.
DIZZY	Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
JOHNNY	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy. Gillespie carries the communications package.
GILLESPIE	I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
RASCZAK	Keep trying, Sergeant.
JOHNNY	BUGS...! Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits. Roughnecks set them on fire when they hit the ground.
DIZZY	Johnny, watch out ! Dizzy fires, blowing it apart. The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere above them in the rocks.
RASCZAK	LET'S GO ! ON THE BOUNCE !
RASCZAK	Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
GILLESPIE	AAAAAAAAAAA !
Two hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs	join to feast.
RASCZAK	Throw a rifle ! claws. Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie.
RASCZAK	I expext any one here to do the same for me... Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy prepare for rear guard action. The rest of you make for 4th Brigade. on the flat lands from the canyon walls.
RASCZAK	FIRE...!
RASCZAK	FALL BACK 100 METERS...!
RASCZAK	AND FIRE...!
RASCZAK	4TH BRIGADE HQ ! ON THE BOUNCE ! compound wall. Inside, WORKER BUGS graze on the remains of 200 dead cap troopers strewn over the complex.
RASCZAK	Jeez, Command really humped the bunk on this one... killing the workers.
RASCZAK	Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
JOHNNY	Yes, sir. everywhere. It's here, sir. It' dead, too.
JOHNNY	Diz, see what you can do.
DIZZY	I'm on it ! head.
RASCZAK	What's that look like to you, Rico ?
JOHNNY	Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir. Lieutenant, I think you're gonna wanna see this, sir.
ACE	Dirty bugs came in right when they were having chow !
RASCZAK	Gas that hole and seal it. face first.
ACE	Officer on the deck, sir.
RASCZAK	Pick up the general ! Rasczak bends down to listen.
GENERAL OWEN	Get out... you gotta get me out...!
RASCZAK	General Owen, sir ?
GENERAL OWEN	At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for you, for all of you...this is grand... so where's the boat ?
GENERAL OWEN	I was forced to hide, of course. The security of the Federation in this theater of operations was at stake !
JOHNNY	Diz, what's with the uplink ?
DIZZY	Workin on it...!
GENERAL OWEN	They get in your mind... they make you do things ! Look here... They did it to Farley...!
RASCZAK	The distress call... The bugs wanted us to rescue you...!
GENERAL OWEN	Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were biding their time... waiting for the most opportune moment !
RASCZAK	To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak. Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are going to be attacked...!
GENERAL OWEN	They weren't gonna do it to me. Oh no ! I know too many secrets !
SUGAR WATKINS (O.S.)	Fire in the hole ! General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and begins to keen, collapsing to his knees.
GENERAL OWEN	Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my boys and girls...! Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard.
LT. RASCZAK	Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and you're not !
GENERAL OWEN	I know... I wish you'd shoot me...
LT. RASCZAK	I oughta ! next to Johnny and Rasczak.
ACE	Lieutenant, we got trouble ! the march from every direction. Bug batteries open up in the distance.
RASCZAK	Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
JOHNNY	What's going on, Diz ?
DIZZY (O.S.)	I got power ! Gimme a minute !
JOHNNY	We don't have a minute ! pulse guns chatter.
DIZZY	What frequency ?
JOHNNY	All bands.
DIZZY	Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group... This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
JOHNNY	SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now ! What is your position ?
JOHNNY	Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
RODGER YOUNG (O.S.)	Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
JOHNNY	Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy ! the compound, lands next to Rasczak on the wall.
JOHNNY	Boat coming down, sir !
ROUGHNECKS	I'm empty...all nuked out... Me, too ! Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath millions of marching feet.
ACE	Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
JOHNNY	Not enough, I guess.
Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below,	stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers.
SUGAR WATKINS	General ! GENERAL, stay with the wounded... Sir, the general...!
RASCZAK	Ah, the hell with him... make easy pickings for ones that get through.
RASCZAK	Fall back... form a circle ! If no living bug comes over that wall, we cannot be harmed. Bugs pile in over the walls. The circle affords them 360 degrees of kill zone.
RASCZAK	Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy ! We control the sky until retrieval !
JOHNNY ET AL	Yes, sir ! of the circle, sweeping the skies with the heavy guns from the towers. Hoppers are blown to pieces.
ACE	Getting low here, sir !
DIZZY	300 rounds and counting, sir !
RASCZAK	Make every shot count ! bug plasma, takes a grazing hit, rights itself with retros and lands within the circle. Roughnecks cheer, saved !
RASCZAK	Sergeant, secure the boat !
JOHNNY	Yes, sir !
RASCZAK	Board the wounded ! soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers.
RASCZAK	Move to retrieval on my command ! First group, now...! More and more bugs pile in over the compound walls.
RASCZAK	Alright, Flores ! Levy ! Rico...! vomits blood as something chews on him from below.
RASCZAK	AAAAAAAAAAAA !
JOHNNY	Cover us, Ace !
JOHNNY	Hit your jets, sir !
RASCZAK	I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
RASCZAK	Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
JOHNNY	We're not leaving you here, sir !
RASCZAK	This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
JOHNNY	Give'em hell, sir ! but soon the bugs are all over him.
RASCZAK	C'mon you sons of bitches ! There's no bug alive can kill a real mAAAAAAA ! down on Dizzy, it's claws ripping into her abdomen.
DIZZY	AAAAAAA ! GET IT OFF ME
GET IT OFF GET IT OFF	GET IT AAAAAAAAAA ! her neck. Johnny picks her up, tries to stop the blood with his hand. The life is leaving her eyes.
JOHNNY	Hang on, Diz... don't die on me... friends. The hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays. The boat blasts off, dripping metal.
DIZZY	I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
JOHNNY	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
DIZZY	It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
JOHNNY	Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock...!
ZANDER	On whose authority, Corporal ?
JOHNNY	This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
CARMEN	Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
JOHNNY	I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
CARMEN	Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard Planet P-11... out of her mouth. Her body thrashes. HEH HEH HEH HEH...! They drop her and move on to the next casualty. Johnny sits there, stunned. Carmen enters from the cockpit.
CARMEN	Negative on your request. Fleet Command has the battle group on standby...
CARMEN	...I'm sorry.
JOHNNY	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
CARMEN	No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. 100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires.
CARMEN	I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
JOHNNY	That was just a mix up.
CARMEN	You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
JOHNNY	What happened to your eye ?
CARMEN	Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
JOHNNY	I like it. It's kinda...you.
lands on the flight deck of the Rodger Young in the midst of the	flotilla.
ZANDER	Where are you going ?
CARMEN	A funeral.
ZANDER	That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
CARMEN	Yeah.
ZANDER	How do you feel about him now ?
CARMEN	I don't know, Zander.
ZANDER	I do. Roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects.
JOHNNY	Dizzy bought the farm. She was my good friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets... But in war, we must go on without our friends. We take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death. Let me tell you what it is: Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting.
JOHNNY	Officer on deck ! His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, nods to Carmen.
CARL	Please continue, Sergeant.
JOHNNY	Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
JOHNNY	Womb to tomb, cap trooper !
ROUGHNECKS	Womb to tomb ! disperses into space. The Roughnecks file out. Carl approaches. Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the hand.
CARMEN	Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
JOHNNY	How are you, Carl ?
CARL	Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
JOHNNY	Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
CARL	Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
CARMEN	You knew and you sent them anyway ?
CARL	A colony has to reach a certain size before it produces a Brain... we think 300 generations. Woulda too expensive to launch an operation if there wasn't a Brain...
CARL	You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
JOHNNY	Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
CARL	Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
JOHNNY	The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
CARL	I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
JOHNNY	I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
CARMEN	Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl.
CARL	It's good to see you two. It reminds me of the way things were before...
CARMEN	Take care, wilya Johnny ?
JOHNNY	See you on the bounce ! She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared. Carmen turns to Captain Deladier.
CARMEN	Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
DELADIER	He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand. she's made a painful decision.
ACE	Officer on the deck ! much younger faces.
JOHNNY	I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me ?
ROUGHNECKS	We get you, sir !
JOHNNY	Who're all these kids ?
ACE	We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
JOHNNY	We're the old men, Ace. push bodies into a mass grave, among them Rasczak. Johnny walks past with his team.
JOHNNY	We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
ACE	Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
JOHNNY	Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
JOHNNY	Alright, cut it out. We will deploy from skimmers in teams of six. If the bugs open up a battery, we put it out of business. Any questions ? to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER.
JOHNNY	Would'ya mind moving your boat ?
FLEET OFFICER	Better talk to the boss. to oversee the operation.
JOHNNY	You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
ZANDER	This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
JOHNNY	You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down - Zander and Johnny share a look of concern.
ZANDER	Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...! I'll take the first group.
JOHNNY	Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
DELADIER	Evasive action !
CARMEN	Prepare for warp !
NEW NUMBER 2	Yes, ma'am ! Warp in 5... 4...
CARMEN	This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
DELADIER	Ibanez...LET'S GO ! Captain Deladier's leg is crushed when an airlock closes on her.
DELADIER	AAAAAAAAAAA !
DELADIER	Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
CARMEN	No way, ma'am ! for it, pulls Deladier in after. someone's trombone. She sets her beacon and the pod plummets downward.
CARMEN	Mayday, mayday ! This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez in lifepod RY63... I'm going in...
JOHNNY	What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
ZANDER	The Rodger Young just burned up...
JOHNNY	Any survivors ? Johnny tracks it on his "head up". pulse rifle. Tunnels lead in every direction.
CARMEN	This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez. Is anyone receiving ?
JOHNNY (O.S.)	Affirmative ! Carmen, this is Roughneck base camp... What is your present location ? and kills it. Now there are two. Carmen backs up firing, but there are too many.
CARMEN	My present location is 42 degrees South by 176 degrees East... situation is extremely hostile... I...AAAAAAAAA ! cut her trigger finger off at the knuckle. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
JOHNNY	We've gotta go get her !
ZANDER	You know as well as I do she's probably already dead. boil up out of the ground.
SUGAR WATKINS	Here they come !
JOHNNY	We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
ZANDER	Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here- canyon. The Hercules boat topples, crushing Skimmers and unfortunate Fleet personnnel. below the planet's surface. Above them, bugs line the wide rim of the newly formed canyon.
JOHNNY	Form a perimeter ! piling out of them by the score, deadly Arachnid warriors. Johnny throws Zander a pulse cannon.
JOHNNY	Make yourself useful, fly boy... PREPARE TO REPEL BUGS ! pieces. Gas grenades fly and H.E. rounds close tunnels. A maimed warrior gets through and heads for Zander. AAAAAAAAAAA ! loos around, impressed. The Roughnecks have killed a great many bugs.
JOHNNY	Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we need retrieval... Sugar, salvage some armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow.
ZANDER	Thanks.
ACE	Fleet Command says retrieval's no go. The battle group's at safe distance... and we got another problem. Johnny sees another.
JOHNNY	Looks like they're gonna hose us down...
JOHNNY	Alright... Listen up, Roughnecks. We're gonna head west down through bug city, pick up any Rodger Young survivors we run across, and join A Company. Get me ?
ROUGHNECKS	We get you, sir !
ZANDER	What do you think you're doing ?
JOHNNY	I'm gonna save Carmen.
ZANDER	That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
JOHNNY	Yeah, that's right.
ZANDER	Let's go.
JOHNNY	Move out.
Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and	the others fall in behind him.
ACE	Bug hunt !
ROUGHNECKS	BUG HUNT ! everything that gets in their way. Zander lends his inexperienced hand.
JOHNNY	Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
ACE	Yes, sir !
JOHNNY	Sugar, close the tunnel...!
SUGAR	Fire in the hole ! with human dead. A nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade Off in the dark she hears HUMAN MOANING. to SCREAMING. It's coming from outside the pit. She pulls herself up to peer over the edge. small (2 meters) CHARIOT BUGS. Aworker walks pas, stepping on her, but pays her no attention. between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees,
DELADIER	NAAAAAAAA...! OH PLEASE... cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of chariot bugs.
DELADIER	...OH GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAA...!
DELADIER	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into her limbs.
CARMEN	AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape. All she wants to do is die. A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. Johnny enters the chamber alone. The warriors freeze.
JOHNNY	You know what this is...?
JOHNNY	Sure you do... You're a big fat smart bug, aren't you ? The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, his finger on the nuke's trigger.
