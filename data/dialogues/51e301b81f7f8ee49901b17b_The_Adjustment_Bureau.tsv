CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
VOICE ON PA SYSTEM	Thank you so much for coming today-- A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.
BLUE BLAZER	Congressman Norris-? Now REVEAL that we're Â±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building
BLUE-BLAZER	Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've never seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle. CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--.
CHARLIE	Just wait 'till you see how they respond to him.. David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens
DAVID	Don't build me up like that, Charlie. He'll be disappointed.
DAVID	Hi there. I'm David Norris. And I'm running for the US Senate. The crowd goes wild. --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation. --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the Karen Woods, founder. Husband: Bob.
DAVID (CONT'D)	Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little League. John Pascal. Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two year old: Loyita... He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan Sabovic, Jim Vargas... His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning. The silence back...it's deafening.
CHARLIE	What the hell? What happened to "I'm going to have softie tea, rest my voice, and go to bed early?" You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four AM for us to make it in time. David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand
DAVID	I had some tea. Come on, man. We're eight points up in the polls. I've gotta cut loose every once in a while and have a life. This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen having a life to him...
CHARLIE	Ten.
DAVID	What?
CHARLIE	Latest poll has you ten points up. A slow smile spreads across David's face.
BLACK SCREEN	The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder:
CAMPAIGN AIDE.	County reporting: 8901 for Lynfield, 7233 for Norris. Better than I thought, I thought we'd get killed in Seneca. He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen
CHARLIE	Eddie, call Boyd! Where the hell are the. Suffolk numbers? We've got to get the Suffolk numbers!
PUNDIT #1	Congressman Norris has a reputation for being very direct, even blunt, in his campaign speeches, which is great until you say too many things you wish you hadn't. Then you start to look like an amateur.
PUNDIT #2	That's bad for any candidate but it's fatal if you're running for Senate at the age of 33, your opponent keeps calling you an "impulsive kid," and you almost killed your entire political career five months ago with an act of immaturity that ended up on the front page of`.the New York Post. David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then
-CHARLIE	Why are you still watching CNN? They called this way too early. David doesn't share his friend's optimism.
AIDE	Suffolk County Numbers! Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen. Lynfield: 415,120. Norris: Charlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly.
CHARLIE	I really thought we'd win Suffolk. A senior aide walks over.
SENIOR AIDE	Kings County just came in too.
A BRUTAL	He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David. beat...
DAVID	Well, it's over. And it's going to be a blowout... David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment
SENIOR AIDE	NBC has us up next. Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC.
BRIAN WILLIAMS	Turning now to the New York Senate race, NBC is now calling the election for Roger'Lynfield. After a shockingly poor showing in both Suffolk county and in his home county, Kings, it now appears that David Norris will lose this election badly, perhaps by as much as 10 points.
RICHARDSON	This is a.bignight, gentleman. Is ever ything set? Harry nods. Richardson notices his eyes:
RICHARDSON	You look tired. You should take a vacation when we finish with this. You'll have earned it.
HARRY	I'm not sure the kind of tired I feel would be fixed by a vacation.
RICHARDSON	Sure it would. Everybody needs a vacation. Even us. I'm going to take a walk, figure out my speech.
Four-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big	
ASSISTANT MANAGER	Good evening, Congressman. You're in the Grand Ballroom if that's what you're looking for.
DAVID	Actually just looking for a place to be alone for a minute before I head in there.
ASSISTANT MANAGER	None of the banquet rooms on the third floor are in use tonight.
DAVID	Thank you.
WOMAN	Hi. I hope I didn't startle you.
DAVID	What are you doing in here?
WOMAN	Hiding from security.
DAVID	Oh... . What did you do?
WOMAN	Crashed a wedding. One floor up.
DAVID	It's almost midnight. They'just caught on now?
WOMAN	Ivana Trump finally realized I wasn't her niece. I think after the fifth; glass of champagne my Czech accent started slipping. spite of David's state that gets a grin.
DAVID	Are you for real?
WOMAN	Life is short.
DAVID	Hard to argue with that.
WOMAN	You're that guy running for Senate aren't you?
DAVID	I'm "that guy."
WOMAN	You winning?
DAVID	No.
WOMAN	Too bad. The other guy's a tool. Maybe I should have made that clearer in my ads.
WOMAN	Personally, I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal. And I don't think the Post should have printed the photo. David just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that
WOMAN	At least not full page. He can't help but crack up.
WOMAN	Listen, I've done it.
DAVID	You weren't running, for Senate at the time.
WOMAN	Do you still have a chance or is it over?
DAVID	He crushed me. She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for
WOMAN	You must ...I don't know what you must be feeling...
DAVID	Winning would feel better. But losing has its advantages.
WOMAN	Like what?
DAVID	The only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep.. .or in the bathroom. After eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take. She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.
WOMAN	Watching you, you'd never know it. The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows
DAVID	Thank you...
WOMAN	Well, everything happens for a reason, right? Even losing. God, I'm really rollrng out the platitudes tonight, aren't I?
DAVID	It's the champagne. Brines out the Hallmark in people.
WOMAN	After it kills their Czech accents. She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it.
DAVID	Why not? I have to think up some good platitudes for my speech. He takes a gulp of champagne.
WOMAN	Why the hell would you do that?
DAVID	Apparently, even if I hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign I would have lost the election anyway because I'm too blunt.
WOMAN	Says who?
DAVID	The TV pundits.
WOMAN	Fuck 'em. They just wish they had the balls to be candidates themselves. She hands him the champagne bottle again.
WOMAN	And they work for the Man anyway. You going to run again? Tonight's probably not the night to ask. No, it is. Look at me. You have to run again. Do-yo hear me? She's serious about this. Intense.
WOMAN	Otherwise the-country will be run by tools. like Lynwood.
DAVID	"Field." "Lynfield." A beat. She shrugs. Then they lean toward each other... and kiss. It turns more
DAVID	Holy shit. She seems just as surprised. They look at each other and Just then the bathroom door opens. It's Charlie. He sees
CHARLIE	David? I better go. She exits.
DAVID	Wait. The woman turns to face David. Suddenly two hotel guards
HOTEL SECURITY	There! They rush toward her.
WOMAN	Gotta go. Don't let the bastards grind you down. She spins and sprints away. The hotel guards chase her.
CHARLIE	What the hell was that?
DAVID	I'm really not sure. David has a huge grin on his face.
DAVID	But I think I'm ready to give my speech.
DAVID	I grew up in Red Hook and I don't want to shock anybody but I got in a few fist fights along the way. Laughter ripples through the crowd. We don't know enough yet
DAVID	And we used to have a saying when you got in a fight: "it's not whether or not you get knocked down -- because eventually everyone does back up." Don't worry, I'm not going to moon you. The audience explodes with laughter this time.
DAVID	But I am... But I am going to get backup. I wanted to come out here tonight and give you a victory speech, a speech I've dreamed of giving foremost of my life. But life doesn't always deal you the cards you want. The audience sobered now. Reflective.
DAVID	My life changed when I was ten years old. My entire world turned upside-down.' His audience,. knows exactly what he's talking about.
DAVID	And as I looked for something to -hang ;on to, something; to help me cope' with what had. happened the only thing that made sense to me was service. Finding a way to do something with my life that left this world a little better than I found it. The audience is moved. Tears begin to well up. People dab A black Mercedes pulls up on Madison Ave. Mr. Richardson,
RICHARDSON	He spills his coffee when he steps out of Starbucks. The moment he comes through the door.
HARRY	Got it.
RICHARDSON	Our models indicate between 7:00 and 7:05 am. Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.
RICHARD SON	You planned that vacation, right?
HARRY	Two weeks. Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves. Harry
CNBC ANCHOR (V.0.)	RSR Capital announced yesterday that David Norris would become its Vice Chairman.

DAVID	Hello? Tom Frankel from the Journal is calling you in five minutes. I just gave him this number.
DAVID	Give him 3227. I'm not used to this phone yet.
CHARLIE	Can't. He's going to ask you about joining the firm. My compliance guys say all firm business has to be done on the blackberry.
DAVID	Really?
CHARLIE	Sarbanes-Oxley. You voted for it, pal. In fact, you cosponsored it. .As David pays, he notices Harry sprinting for the bus.
DAVID	Sir, there's someone--
BUS DRIVER	There's another M1 right behind me.
HARRY	No... David sits next to her. And stares.
DAVID	No way... It's the woman from election night.', He leans around to try I think. we "ve met. You need a better line than that or I'll have to assume you're a pervert who likes to stare at girls' legs while-, they sleep.
DAVID	Your skirt was so short I couldn't help it.
WOMAN	Dress.
DAVID	Skirt, dress, same thing.
WOMAN	If you're a pervert, yeah. All that matters is they both show leg.
DAVID	So do shorts, dear.
WOMAN	Yeah, but there's that pesky piece of fabric right here that interferes with your fantasy life. She shuts her eyes and leans against the window.
WOMAN	Wake me when you have a good come back to that.
DAVID	I have one but, unlike you, I wouldn't say it in public.
WOMAN	Pussy. David laughs. Can not believe this woman. In a good way.
DAVID	Hello...? Hello? David looks at his. phone. The signal has gone to zero. The line cut.
WOMAN	That ringer get any-louder or do you pretty much have it maxed out?
DAVID	You're relentless.
WOMAN	I never sleep through the night. I catch up on the bus. You going to run again?
DAVID	I just started a new job, today. I saw your concession speech. I heard Bill Clinton called it the best political speech he's seen in 20 years. David looks back at her.
DAVID	Something got into me. He means her. They stare at each other.
DAVID	What's the deal with you and argyles?
WOMAN	What's the deal with you and boring shades of blue? David is wearing a Navy blue suit, blue shirt, and blue tie.
DAVID	At least my clothes match.
WOMAN	That's easy if you. restrict yourself to one color.
DAVID	The belt and shoes are black.
WOMAN	Variety is the spice of .life .
DAVID	There you` go with the platitudes again. I guess it wasn't the ch mpagne . His blackberry goes again. RING-RING.
DAVID	Hello? Hello? He shakes his head. It's dead again.
WOMAN	Your phone sucks. Don't guys like you get special phones that actually work in the middle of the biggest city in the country?
DAVID	Depends what the telecom lobby thinks of your voting record.
HARRY	Now.
DAVID	Oh, Jesus... I'm sorry.
HARRY	Shit! He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse
DAVID	I'll pay for the damage. He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs.
WOMAN	Hope your new job pays better than your old one.
DAVID	Give me your number and I'll send you a check.
WOMAN	God, that is smooth. Spill coffee on me then ask for my number. She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip,
WOMAN	Just let me spill some on you and we'll be even. She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries.
DAVID	It's my first day at the office!
WOMAN	Tell your boss some crazy chick dumped coffee on you on the MI. It's New York; he'll understand. She thrusts the cup back at him-
DAVID	No! He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers. Come on. Just a little. They struggle with the cup. <,;:Both suppressing laughter.
DAVID	You're crazy. Actually crazy. The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with He's not here! She hangs up.
DAVID	Who was that? She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she
DAVID	What is this, third grade?
WOMAN	You forgot what that was like, didn't you? How fun it was... That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again.
WOMAN	Oh my God! How do you stand it? She drops the phone into the coffee.
WOMAN	There. We're even. He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows
WOMAN	Sturdy little fucker, isn't it? She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her
WOMAN	By the way, I'm Elise.
DAVID	The morning after .I lost I woke up thinking about you . That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.
HARRY	Dammit! Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus--
DAVID (TEL. V.O.)	Guess who I just sat down next to on the bus?
CHARLIE	Who?
DAVID	The woman from election night.
CHARLIE (TEL. V.O.)	The one you kissed?
DAVID	She kissed me. I just didn't fight it. You're shitting me. Just randomly you sit down next to-- He's cut off mid-word.
DAVID	Charlie? David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David
DAVID	' (to himself). This is ridiculous. He pockets his phone.
TAXI DRIVER	Are you okay? Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently
HARRY	I'm fine-- Will you hand me that? Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few
TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D)	Are you sure you're okay? The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
HARRY	Oh...shit...
DAVID	Okay... Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.
DAVID	Doesn't anybody bother getting in before eight at this place? David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a Susan! How are you today? Susan? David looks closer across her desk. Her face is frozen.
DAVID (CONT'D)	Susan? He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead
DAVID	Call 911! Something's wrong with Susan!
DAVID	Jesus! Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see
DAVID (,.CONT'D)	What the hell are you doing?! Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:
RICHARDSON	Grab him! David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him-- He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges David jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that Richardson could have gotten there that fast.
RICHARDSON	You can't get away, David. David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,
INSIDE --	Except when they walk through the door they're not in an Their movement completely violates the laws of physics.
BLACK SCREEN	Silence. Then voices come up slowly: Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I understand that, sir. Absolutely. I'll do that, sir. What a goddamm mess.
MCCRADY (O.S.)	Was that Donaldson?
RICHARDSON (O.S.)	Yes. What do you want to do? FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse
RICHARDSON (O.S.)	Can you reset him? I don't think we have the authority in a situation like this.
BURDENSKY (0.S.).	Legal just arrived.
BURDENSKY	Re-setting's off the table. This is our fault:... Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson,
DAVID	Hey. The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to
RICHARDSON	What are my options? You could bullshit him but you'll never be completely successful.
DAVID	Can somebody tell me what's going on?
BURDENSKY	The questions will burn in him till the day he dies. You'll have to monitor him constantly...
ON DAVID	He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying--
BURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE)	.to make sure he doesn't talk... the endless ripple effects... REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him.
BURDENSKY	If it were me, I'd level with him.
RIC:HARDSON	Completely?
BURDENSKY	That's the only way to extinguish his curiosity. Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him.
DAVID	Who are you guys?
RICHARDSON	We're the people v ho make sure things happen according to Plan. David stares back at him for a moment. then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He
CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR	It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as
BACK TO WIDE SHOT	David trips and goes flying-- David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed
RICHARDSON	Did you really think I couldn't see that coming? David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D)	I can read your mind! David stares back. Yeah, really... Choose a color. Blue. Choose a number. Seventeen. David's jaw drops slightly. Richardson was clearly right.
RICHARDSON	Now,. why are you still deciding whether or not to run? David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic
RICHARDSON	You saw the futility of that back at the office. David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
DAVID	What the hell is happening to me?
RICHARDSON	You just saw behind a curtain you weren't even supposed to know was there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring. I'm sure.
DAVID	I just... came to work...
RICHARDSON	It wasn't your fault. Your Path through the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted. Your coffee was supposed to.spill onto your shirt as you left Starbucks near your apartment. You would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten minutes later than you did. By then we would have left. People call it "chance" when their coffee spills or their internet goes down or they misplace their keys. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it's:us...nudging you back on Plan. David takes all this in. He's still shell-shocked.
DAVID	Whatever you were doing to Charlie back there... it wasn't misplacing his keys.
RICHARDSON	Sometimes. when nudging a person back on Plan isn't enough we intervene directly.
DAVID	Why Charlie? What did you do to him.
RICHARDSON	You need to worry about getting back on your Plan, David, not worry about us putting him back on his. David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.
RICHARDSON (CONT'D)	Only a handful of human beings know what you now know, David. We're determined to keep it that way. So before I let you go, you need to understand something: If you ever reveal our existence we will erase your brain. Your memories, your emotions, your entire personality will be expunged. Your friends and family will think you've gone crazy. You won't "think" anything because a blank slate can't "think." Davidstares back.
RICHARDSON	Do you understand what I just said?
DAVID	Yes...
RICHARDSON	Not a word. Not one word about us. okay ... . you're free to go. David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real. Richardson
NEW MAN IN SUIT	There's awoman. There's always & Woman... Richardson motions;to his men. At.-THE DOOR Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.
DAVID	He said I could go.
NEW MAN IN SUIT	You won't believe who she is. He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.
RICHARDSON	How is that possible? Why didn't we get an alert?
NEW MAN IN SUIT	He wasn't supposed to be on that bus. He was supposed to be changing his shirt in his apartment... It was a controlled situation. It was supposed to be. The new man looks at Harry.
AT THE DOOR	David looks back at Richardson.
DAVID	You said I could go. Richardson walks over to him.
RIC,HARDSON	You ran into a woman named Elise on the bus this morning?
DAVID	Why does it'matter?
RICHARDSON	You weren't ever supposed to see her again.
DAVID	Why do you care.?
RICHARDSON	Because, David, you can't be with her. And we didn't want to have to resort to this-- Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
DAVID	What the hell-- What are you-- Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then No! And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull
DAVID (CONT'D)	What is wrong with you people?! Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn. Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
BARTENDER	You're David Norris, right?
DAVID	Ice water.
BARTENDER	That's it? David nods. Harry arrives.
HARRY	We should talk. But not here. Go back to work and I'll contact you later today with a place to meet.
DAVID	Okay. Harry can see that David is still very shaken.
HARRY	The world's exactly the same as it's always been. You just understand it more completely now. Hang on to what mattered before you knew any of this and you'll be fine.
SECRETARY(O.S.)	Mr. IKincaid's in the finance meeting, Congressitan. Main conference room. David turns to see her.
DAVID	Thanks. David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new
CHARLIE	There you are. I called your cell ten times. You left me hanging.
DAVID	Sorry...
CHARLIE	Are you okay? Come on, we're late. Happy first day by the way. They head towards the conference room.
CHARLIE	You sure you're okay.
DAVID	Fine. How about you?
CHARLIE	Great. Why?
DAVID	No headaches or--
CHARLIE	I feel fantastic, -man. Is it just, me or is this an odd conversation? What the hell happened with the girl?
DAVID	After the meeting. David and Charlie walk back to David's office. Please explain to me why you don't have an ear-to-ear smile right now.
DAVID	I lost her number.
CHARLIE	You lost her number?
DAVID	I was pickpocketed.
CHARLIE	Come on. You can't be serious. You're serious... Oh, man...dude. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry... The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so
HARRY	A lot of people just collapse when they see what you've s'een. Their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them. Life starts to feel pointless.
DAVID	I was` raised to believe there's something behind the curtain. I just never pictured it quite like this.
HARRY	Most people don't. Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his
HARRY	How are you feeling?
DAVID	You should know. You can read my mind, right? Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David,
HARRY	Richardson was just trying to scare you.
DAVID	He knew what color I was thinking.
HARRY	Because he set it up as a choice. "Choose a color. Choose a number"
DAVID	So? Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
HARRY	We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts. But before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we percpite that. We know if you're going to go off Plan "or not because, as long as we're close enough, we cansense it when it's about to happen.
DAVID	it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?
HARRY	Seventh, actually.
DAVID	What did they do too Charlie?
HARRY	Made some small change in the way he assesses risk.
DAVID	What type of risk?
HARRY	I don't know. Something arcane. Something to do with mortgage- backed securities.
DAVID	That's all?
HARRY	Yes. What would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me? This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.
HARRY	That's why we're meeting out here.
DAVID	They're not following me?
HARRY	We don't have the manpower to follow everybody all the time. They're checking in on you. Just not here. Not right now. ON David's face considering this.
DAVID	Why are you helping me?
HARRY	I have my reasons. David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into
DAVID	Why do they care if I'm with Elise?
HARRY	Your entire reality gets shattered this morning and you want to know about a woman?
DAVID	Why do they care? Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
HARRY	I don't know.
DAVID	You have no idea?
HARRY	All I know is, given the amount of resources they've used, keeping you from her is pretty important to them. You're going to look for her aren't you? Again, David is silent.
HARRY (CONT'D)	There are twelve million people in this city. On a slow day. You're not going to find her, you do realize that, don't yore-? Even if a hypnotist pulled her number out of the recesses of your brain, no matter how many times you called it, you,'d never get through...
DAVID	They send you here to tell me that? You want my advice? Forget about her. Accept that you'`>ll never see her again. Move on with your life. ON David as Harry's words sink in. After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)	How are you feeling about the speech? David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
DAVID	I'm ready... I changed a few things last night.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)	Tell me at breakfast.
THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID	David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
DAVID	Stop the bus.
DRIVER	The next stop--
DAVID	Now.
DAVID	Elise! The woman turns around. And it's her...
ELISE	David?
DAVID	Hi.
ELISE	Wow... How areyou. Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:
DAVID	I rode the Ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day I'd run into you again. She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.
ELISE	Calling would have been easier.
DAVID	I couldn't.
ELISE	Girlfriend wouldn't let you?
DAVID	No girlfriend. She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
DAVID (CONT'D)	Can we go somewhere and talk? She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
ELISE	Don't you have to get to work?
DAVID	I just got sick.
ELISE	"I haven't seen you in three years - - You make me sick" is not an ideal come-on. For the record. David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
DAVID	One second. CharlieT can't make breakfast.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)	Why not?
DAVID	And...I might have to push the speech.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)	What? Are you crazy?!
DAVID	I just ran into Elise. He hangs up.
ELISE	You just hung up on your best friend.
DAVID	We've known each other since we were kids. We have a shorthand. He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter-
ELISE	What speech?
DAVID	Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk. His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting
ELISE	Where?
DAVID	Somewhere far. We have a lot to talk about.
ELISE	I don't think you should cancel your speech. What if I don't like you at the end of our walk?
DAVID	I'll take my chances.
ELISE	Seri6us1y, my number hasn't changed:. Just call me like you didn't last time.
DAVID	My-speech will always be there, you might not be. I was there, David. You didn't callrie!
DAVID	Walk with me and I'll explain that. She's still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns
DAVID (CONT'D)	I'm not losing you again. I'm not letting you out of my sight.
ELISE	Stalker.
DAVID	Can we walk?
FOLLOWING SHOT	Polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly
MCCRADY	We have a problem.
ELISE	It's been years, David. How do you know I don't have a boyfriend? Oh, shit. He hasn't even had time to think about that.
DAVID	you have a boyfriend? Would it-Matter? Uh...yeah...
ELISE	So all the stuff about me being in your mind constantly for the last three years was just talk... The truth is you don't have any real conviction.
DAVID	It wouldn't matter.
ELISE	So you don't care about being a home-wrecker?
DAVID	Okay... if you were married it would matter.
ELISE	Now you're just trying to say what you think I want to hear. A beat. She lets David twist in the wind...
ELISE	I'm single. ON David's face: relief...
ELISE	Now let's hear your bullshit excuse for never calling me.
DAVID	I didn't have your number.
ELISE	What?
DAVID	It was taken from me. I was mugged.
ELISE	Oh, come on.
DAVID	Your number was in my Wallet and they ,:took it.
ELISE	Come on..
DAVID	I'm serious. What else could possibly-explain my fawning all over you on that bus three years ago...and again today and not calling you in between? Um, you had a girlfriend and you felt guilty. I have a thing about being lied to, David.
DAVID	I swear to God I didn't have your number. I swear on my parents' graves. I didn't even have a last name to try to track you down. Do you know how many pages come back when you type "Elise" into Google? And none of them were you.
ELISE	You really are smooth.
DAVID	That's not fair.
ELISE	It's okay. I like it. I probably shouldn't, but I do. It's Sellas. Elise Sellas.
RICHARDSON	Tell me you're kidding. How could our Path-analysis miss this? McCrady just shakes his head, mystified... Richardson walks
RICHARDSON	'rlhek,e are they now?`
MCCRADY	Central Park. Bethesda Fountain.
ELISE	I read somewhere you're running again.
DAVID	I haven't announced yet but... soon.
ELISE	I hope I had a little something to do with that.
DAVID	That concession speech I gave sure did. You had everything to do with that. Elise smiles.
DAVID	You know entirely too much about me given how little I know about you.
ELISE	According to Cosmo I'm supposed to keep it that way.
DAVID	According to Maxim, I'm supposed to "maintain eye contact and ask you what you do for a living." It's the first witty comment h6' :s made this time around. I'm a dancer.
DAVID	Oh..
ELISE	Not like that, you pervert. In a dance company. The. Manhattan Modern Ballet.
DAVID	I think you have the wrong idea about me.
ELISE	I think it was the first thing that crossed your mind.
DAVID	Is there a performance of this company coming up that I could watch?
ELISE	Actually, we have a show opening tomorrow night.
DAVID	I'm there. You hungry yet? He points at the Boathouse restaurant a few hundred feet down
ELISE	Yeah... But I'm not putting out just because you're buying me brunch.
DAVID	We could wait an hour and call it lunch.
ELISE	I bet lines like that work wonders with the "dancers" you normally hang out with.
DAVID	So unfair... Somehow Richardson and' McCrady have travelled from downtown
WAITER	Good morning. It's good to see you again,.sir.
DAVID	Thank you. You're... Paul, right? De...Santo?
WAITER	Wow, yeah. How did you remember that? It's been a year.
RICHARDSON AIDE	Morris is on the artistic director. Melton is on Charlie Traynor.
RICHARDSON	This whole thing will be over in an hour.
MCCRADY	We may not have that long.
RICHARDSON	What?
ELISE	How do you do that? I can't remember the names of people I just met.
DAVID	David.
ELISE	Right.. Thanks_.'
MCCRADY	Her decision tree is diverging from our models. 36 hours without contact and she'll never speak to him again. I've studied her file. Her deepest fear in life is--
MCCRADY	No, something is wrong. I'm already seeing inflection points. Off Richardson's surprised look--
ELISE	Ballet is basically impossible to do correctly.
DAVID	Why?
ELISE	You just do absurd things. with your body. The movement is completely unnatural. It requires incredible strength in all sorts of random muscles. And you have to be born with ridiculous amounts of flexibility in your hip or you'll never be an y good. Richardson points at the red point closest to the present
RICHARDSON	What's that?
MCCRADY	If they kiss... A kiss, that's all it takes?
MCCRADY	A real kiss. But once they do that every possible adjustment that's strong enough to break them up will cause ripples over your limit.
RICHARDSON	If Melton and Morris do their jobs right we'll be okay. But Richardson is clearly worried.
ELISE	In the history of ballet there've only been a handful of people who actually did ballet the way it's supposed to be done. Forme that just made it completely addictive.
DAVID	Do you ever get nervous when people watch you?
ELISE	Not really. Do you get anxious when you make 'a speech?
DAVID	I get more anxious alone in my apartment than in front of an auditorium full of people. Everything's backwards for me.
VOICE (OS.	I hate to interrupt. They turn to see Charlie'''aynor. I tXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO DAY Richardson turns to a colleague, Melton, who steps through
RICHARDSON	Nice work.
DAVID	How did you find me?
CHARLIE	Does it matter? Elise, pleasure to see you again. There's a crowd of people standing around downtown waiting for you.
ELISE	Your speech?
CHARLIE	He's announcing today.
ELISE	At the speech?
DAVID	It's okay.
CHARLIE	What's okay? It's not okay. The one thing you can't be this. time around is impulsive. That's why we're announcing the way we are,
ELISE	God, don't skip this for me.
DAVID	I told you I'm not letting you out of my sight.
CHARLIE	David, what the hell?
DAVID	Come with me. Come and watch. Okay. Her phone buzzes with a text message.
CHARLIE	Great. Perfect solution. Now, let's pay and get you over there. Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check.
ELISE	Now?
CHARLIE	The speech is in 30 minutes.
ELISE	I can't then. They just moved my dress rehearsal to noon. David's own sixth sense kicks in. Has he been discovered?
DAVID	We can reschedule the speech.
ELISE	David! Thank you. David looks around for anything out of the ordinary, any sign
ELISE	I'll meet you right after the rehearsal.
DAVID	Where does your company perform?
ELISE	We're n in our space. There was a`;â¢power ot outage or something. We're using a space" on Murray and West Broadway today. That's four blocks from where you're speaking. David reacts: Richardson can't be behind that.
CHARLIE	You can literally walk there after the speech. David nods, his suspicions fading. But we've got to leave right now.
MCCRADY	The "four blocks" thing was a brilliant move, boss.
RICHARDSON	We're not out of the woods yet. He looks down at the inflection points in McCrady's Planbook. I've got to go that way...to stop by my apartment and change.
DAVID	Okay. David and Elise stop to say goodbye to-each other.
ELISE	You know, the speech on election night, you said I inspired you... I wish I could do that again now.
EST.BOATHOUSE PATIO DAY	Richardson makes a small hand motion in Charlie's direction.
DAVID AND ELISE	David leans toward Elise-- David, the speech starts in 15 minutes. We have a 25 minute drive. He then moves a water glass on'their table. The sun hits the As the daughter turns back to look at her mother, she notices
DAVID AND ELISE	David squeezes her hand... and leans in again--
DAVID	just want to
VOICE. (0. S . )	I hope the rumors are true, Congressman. David pulls back fr`bm Elise, suddenly self-conscious, turns
40 YEAR-OLD WOMAN	You have my vote. Mine too... and I usually disagree with her.
DAVID	Thanks. Thanks a lot. David turns back to Elise. Well, you're really just a hit with women of all ages, aren't you?
CHARLIE -- A FEW FEET AWAY	On the phone.
CHARLIE	I'm wrangling him right now--
DAVID	Whatever happens...I'm not going to let anything stand between us this time. It's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what David
ELISE	Okay.:.. I believe you. Of course I tend to believe in the wrong people. Especially men. It's the kind of quip that's more truth than jest.
DAVID	Not this time. He leans in to kiss her--
DAVID	I'll see you in two hours.
MCCRADY	We're okay...
RICHARDSON	That was way too close. What the hell is going on with this case?
DAVID	What?
CHARLIE	I've just never seen you like that. David can't possibly explain.
CHARLIE	"I'm going to-postpone my announcement to have brunch with a woman?" Postpone any speech. I know she made an impression on you but this is ... Charlie just shakes his head, unable to comprehend. A beat.
CHARLIE	"What is it about her? I don't know...
RICHARDSON	Richardson. Yes, sir. Believe me, it was a surprise to me too. But I think we have it under control.
LAUREN	Oh, you're clone. You're gone...
MINUTES LATER -- DAY	A half-dozen news organizations, film the speech.
DAVID	.I'm here today to honor that, and to announce my intention to run for the United States Senate...
LAUREN	Just tell me if he disappears one more time you'll never take his call again.
ELISE	Don't worry. That's definite.
CHARLIE	Good Morning America at 7am tomorrow, then you have the bankers group... David, are you listening? David's staring out the window. The sunlight has caught the
RICHARDSON (INTO PHONE)	I ' 11-keep you = posted, sir. Richardson hangs up the phone and turns .t look out at David.
RICHARDSON	D` emit ! Richardson-steps back out of the sunlight.
MCC- .DY	What?
RICHARDSON	Get out of the sunlight. McCrady, notices David looking, jumps back out of the light. I cannot get a break on this case.
DAVID	I have to see Elise now.
CHARLIE	After you go back out there and talk to the New York channels--
DAVID	Tomorrow. After GMA. He heads for the door. Charlie follows.
CHARLIE	No, we need this on the nightly-- David... Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the right
CHARLIE	Every time we get close.. .you do something to derail it. A beat. There's a truth to that. David knows it. But--
DAVID	This is different. Trust me, it's different. David leaves.
DAVID	Elise ...I doubt you'll ever get this message but-- David dials 411.
DAVID	Can I have the number for the Manhattan Modern Ballet... He looks down to see his phone has zero bars...
MCCRADY	He's going to go next door:. Just then David exits the furniture store and goes next door
MCCRADY	You can't keep.-thephones and internet down on the whole block, for too much. longer without running into ripple problems... Could itbe called something else?
DAVID	Do you have a phone book? David gets to the phone book page that ends with "Manhattan
RICHARDSON	There is an entire world of women out there. I thought I made it clear this one was off limits. David takes off walking.
DAVID	I must have forgotten. It's been a while.
RICHARDSON	Doesn't change the fact. David looks around, trying to figure out his next move.
DAVID	Why are you so.determined to keep us apart?
RICHARDSON	You know: why.
DAVID	The Plan? If there is a Pi ri you misread it.
RICHARDSON	There's no misreading what the Plan says about you and Elise. It's unequivocal.
DAVID	Then your Plan's wrong.
RICHARDSON	Do you realize who wrote this Plan?
DAVID	I don't care. Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall.
RICHARDSON	Well you should. You need to learn a little more respect. David shoves him off. Looks like he might take a swing at
DAVID	Why are you keeping us apart?
RICHARDSON	Because the Plan calls for it. You put us together three times--
RICHARDSON	That was chance. That wasn't us.
DAVID	Three times? Bullshit! If I'm not supposed to be with her then why do I feel like this?
RICHARDSON	It doesn't matter what you feel. It matters what's in black and white. David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in
DAVID	You don't know, do you? You don't know why they're keeping us apart... 'It's not something your mind could :comprehend.
DAVID	You're in a nice suit but the reality is you're just a minion aren't you? David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy
MCCRADY	He's deciding how to-- Uh..oh-- Excuse me ladies and gentleman-- I'm sorry to disturb your lunch. I have a bit of an emergency. Is there anybody in this room who's ever seen a performance of the Manhattan Modern Ballet?
RICHARDSON	Son of a bitch.
MCCRADY	He's smart. He's very smart. David exits the restaurant from another door. He hurries
RICHARDSON	Maybe you should try the subway. David holds him in a steely gaze.
DAVID'	Don't all those cab drivers you're diverting have Plans too? What about all the other people looking for cabs in this part of the city right n6t? What about their Plans? The ripples must be endless... Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out.
DAVID	I don't care what you put in my way, I'm not going to give up. David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there. Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a
MCCRADY	You've got two more minutes keeping taxis off West Broadway before-- I need something that's going to keep him in place longer--
DAVID	Jesus:., Is this how far you people will go?! He rushes toward the accident--
ARE	An hour later. Four police cars and an ambulance. They
POLICE OFFICER	Unfortunately you're the only witness, Congressman.
DAVID	How much longer?
POLICE OFFICER	A few more minutes. I'm sorry. I know you have to meet somebody.
DAVID	I didn't say I had to meet anyone.
POLICE OFFICER	Well ...I just assumed--
RICHARDSON	Amateur! That's an amateur's mistake!
DAVID	You're not a real cop, are you? You're one of them. Somebody could have been killed in that crash! Doesn't that make you--
"POLICE OFFICER"	Sir, calm down. But David's already walking away.
DAVID	Sergeant! He goes to the highest ranking guy on the. scene.
DAVID	I know you heed a statement from me, but do I have to stay here to give it to you or--
SERGEANT	No, sir, we know ow to get in touch with you.
DAVS,D	Thank you. '.Is this man under your command? David turns to see that the "Police Officer" who was
DAVID	17th Street between 10th and 11th. And sir, you might have to break some traffic laws getting there. So take this. He hands him a $100 bill. A light that just turned green
DAVID	Go through that-- The driver blows through it as it turns re
ACROSS THE STREET	Richardson and McCrady are in front of a hip cafe arguing.
RICHARDSON	I want more red liUhtss--
MCCRADY	There are too many, ripples in the system.. Cumm.lative effects are. coming into play.
RICHARDSON	A traffic jam.
MCC	That's even w r. We have to get more localize. Richardson looks at the taxi disappearing up Hudson.
RICHARDSON	He's getting out of range!
CHEF	Hey! The chef charges over and pulls open the door to find --
RI.CEARDSON	Wrong one. (thinks).. Two doors down. God, I hate downtown! I've got inflection points. All they have to do is catch sight of each other this time--
RICHARDSON	What?
RECEPTIONIST	Is she expecting you? He nods.
LAUREN	I hope you realize how lucky you are. I'm the friend. Lauren.
RICHARDSON	Can 'I block the front door?
NCCRADY	He's already through Pit.
RICHARDS6N	The next one!
LAUREN	It goes without saying that I'll kill you if you hurt her. And by the way, congratulations on your announcement.
MCCRADY	There are several next ones-- I'm blocking them all-- His hand stretches out (as Harry did early on in film)
MCCRADY	Wait, he's--
MCCRADY	Hat! Hat! McCrady is behind him He points. at Richardson's fedora,
DAVID	I'm in serious trouble here... Forget it! He's already there... Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring
RICHARDSON	Dammit ! McCrady's phone buzzes. He pulls it out and looks at the It's Mr. Donaldson. Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in David turns just in time to see this. At the same time
RICHARDSON	Celebrate while you can. They'll just kick it upstairs now You have no idea what you're up against. David just looks at him. He'll deal with that when it comes...
MCCRADY	Sir? Richardson grabs the phone and answers --.going outside to David turns back to the dance studio. He opens the door to When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes,
SECRETARY #1	He's waiting for you. Donaldson motions for him to sit down.
now.	David talks to Elise, who's showered and dressed
DAVID	You're incredible. How did you get that good?
ELISE	It's all I do. It's the only thing I ever wante& to be. And I started young.
AVID	How young?
ELISE	By third grade I was going every day after school.
DAVID	That's a lot of motivation for an eight year-old. She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby
ELISE	We moved around a lot then. Dance was kind of my stability.
DAVID	Sure... it was the only constant in your life, aside from your parents...
ELISE	Really more the dance. She doesn't make a big deal of it but we get it.
DAVID	Oh... David's phone buzzes. Caller ID shows it's Charlie.
ELISE	I take it this is an unauthorized social break.
DAVID	I'm a candidate for the US-:Serrate. I don't have to punch out''when I leave. David sends the call to voice.mai
ELISE	Charlie?
DAVID	Couple houtrs while I'm out of touch won't:ill him.
ELISE	Couple hour, huh? Well, we better make them,,-,--'count. What's this-Pï¿½-
ELISE	What's it look like? We see the reflection of a dance club in the window.
DAVID	I'm a terrible dancer. I don't dance. Elise climbs out. David follows.
ELISE	You don't now. By the end of the night, you will. They walk towards "Plan B", a hip joint with zebra wallpaper
DAVID	You're going to teach me to dance in one night? Not happening.
ELISE	Are you doubting me?
DAVID	Yes. She spins and shoves him against the wall. Forcefully kisses
ELISE	Don't. She turns and walks into the club. David stands there.
DAVID	Holy shit...
DONALDSON	The disciplinary rules requ-te me to. demote you in rank and re-assign yot to a less desirable post. Donaldson Â±ingers the document he just signed.
DONALDSON	I'm going-'to interpret those rules loosely. I'm going to go easy on you because,I feel the deck was stacked ,against you. In a WIDER shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson's
DONALDSON	I'm talking about the intense chemistry between them, the constant inflection points, and the kicker of course: you pulling them apart only to have "chance" put them back together. Twice. That seemed impossible. So I asked Burdensky to do some research this morning, which he just completed.
BURDENSKY	It seems like these two were meant to be together because they were meant to be together...
RICHARDSON	What?!
BURDENSKY	Were, in the past, in an earlier version of the plan. Actually a dozen earlier versions. God knows how many artifacts pushing them together are left in the current plan.
DAVID	Serious, serious.trouble...
MOMENTS LATER	Salt, Patron, lime .'-.and two glasses dotin on the bar.
ELISE	Ready? Nope.
ELISE	Perfect. She yanks him onto the dance floor.
RICHARDSON	Why was it changed?
DONALDSON	Something important. They went from "meant to be together" to "red- letter denied relationship" in a single Plan revision a few years back. As for why, specifically, that's apparently above even my pay grade...
RICHARDSON	You spend your whole career hoping that one day you'll get a "red- letter" case. Something you can really make a name for yourself with. Finally I get one... and it's. .booby-trapped... Another set of shot glasses hit the bar. UP to REVEAL David
ELISE	Okay, we've al-ready used up an hour, we >etter hurry. She pills him toward the exit.
DAVID	Hurry where?
ELISE	You've got to let yourself feel the music.
DAVID	I've been told I have trouble feeling.
ELISE	Whoever said that hasn't seen you speak.
DAVID	That's different. I mean--
ELISE	What?
DAVID	In private. With women AlthOugh that might be changing. Is there any style of dance you can:'t do?
ELISE	Next stop, the best 80s club in the city. You ready?
DAVID	To make an ass of myself for the third time in one night? Â§4`r, 6'. Race me to that light. You lose, you dance, I watch. You win, I dance, you watch
DAVID'	What are'the rules of the race---
ELISE	No rules.
DAVID	Hmmm, could get ugly... He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something. When
ELISE	You bastard! He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards.
DAVID	Quit complaining and run. She catches up. He spins and digs it out. He can't dance,
DAVID	Yes!!!! He pumps his arms in a victory dance. That was good. That was very good.
DAVID	You said "no rules". She punches him in the stomach. Hard. He crumples, Sweet Jesus! Christ on a crutch! You said you had trouble feeling.
DAVID	You're insane.
ELISE	We. need a cab. He'laughing through the'pain.
DAVID	I'm serious. You're a maniac. You should come with a warning label.
ELISE	I do. You just can't see it with my clothes on. OFF David biting his lip... and PRE-LAPPING the music--
DAVID	Doesn't this song make you feel like you're at your high school prom?
ELISE	I was six when it came out. So, not really. Brutal. David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls
MUSIC	Baby...1-I-I can't wait--
STROBE LIGHTS	As the song kicks in and David and Elise start dancing... A The kids who first spotted David have alerted a few others.
DONALDSON'S AIDE	So we're going operational? This is exciting. It's been a while.
DONALDS	We r t no ti go p etational No one ever.mad& to my job by taking stupit ï¿½Â°ris,s .
'DONALDSON	We're going to kick this case upstairs.. .to someone with the latitude to clean up this mess without breaking into a sweat. We're going to walk this upstairs to Thompson.
DONALDSON'S AIDE	Thompson? Are we even allowed to go to him directly? He's a Senior
DONALDSON	Exec VP.
DONALDSON'S AIDE	Isn't he the one.. .when he was in the field his nickname was--
DONALDSON	"The Hammer?" Yes. He'll crush this romance with the flick of his hand. And he'll thank me for giving him the opportunity.
STROBE LIGHTS	David and Elise dancing.
MUSIC	Cause I can't wait,. this .is what I've been waiting for-- People on the dance floor are literally screaming in support.
ELISE	You grew up over there? She indicatesa residential area just behind the docks. I spent any, entire childhood three blocks up Carroll Street. We didn'.t move-` around a lot.
ELISE	What were you like as a. kid?
DAVID	Before sixth grade I spent about half my time in the principal's office.
ELISE	You? Really?
DAVID	The only person who spent as much time down there as me was a girl I had a huge crush on so I didn't mind too much. A smile spreads on Elise's face.
ELISE	Did your dad work here?
DAVID	No... My dad filled vending machines.
ELISE	And you're going to be a senator...
DAVID	After my brother died my Dad wanted to get me out of town for a while. We went to Washington and the day we arrived he took meto the. Capitol. We ended up sitting in the Senate gallery;,all day. We could see that from the end of my block, but-be never once encouraged me to go to Wall Street. His idol was JFK. He thought business guys were selfish.
ELISE	So...areyou doing all this-:f.or him?
DAVID	I want to matter. I don't think that's just forrhim. Elise,. tucks her head into his shoulder.
ELISE	I don't want tonight to mess anything..up for you, for the campaign.
DAVID	Just make sure I make it to Diane Sawyer on time and I'll be fine. Elise looks at him for a long beat.
ELISE	You're different... somehow you make me believe...
DAVID	Believe what?
ELISE	Just... believe, period.
ELISE	I don't let people in, David. And I never let them in this quickly. David pulls her close., He-,can't see her eyes. But we can.
ELISE	I haven'::t lead a perfect life
DAVID	I. don't want perfect.,.
ELISE. ,	I'm trying to say .I'm not sure somebody running. for office can have, me in their life. David turns her around so he can see her face, so he knows
DAVID	I haven't stopped thinking about you since the moment I met you. I want you in my life--
ELISE	There are skeletons in my closet, David. The kind that--
DAVID	Listen to me--
ELISE	The kind that people use against--
DAVID	Elise, listen! I don't care. We'll work it out... I've spent my whole life wondering why it takes auditoriums of people to fill the empty space inside me. Then I met you...and realized it doesn't. She looks at him. He means it.
ELISE	You scare me.
DAVID	That wasn't the effect I was going for... She smiles...then laughs out-loud-- David and Eliseirsleep peacefully. REVEAL MR. THOMPSON, late THO Mft N'S AIDE What do you aiat to do?
THOM BON	Let it happen again. 7 Thompson's aides seem surprised by the answer.
DAVID	You been up long?
ELISE	No.
DAVID	Did you wake up in. the middle of the night?
ELISE	Slept straight through.
DAVID	I thought you never sleep through.
ELISE	I don't. I told you, you scare me. He kisses her.
DAVID	I won't hurt you. They kiss more... and then get swept up by it...
LATER	They lie in bed, post-coital, drained. Blissful. Until the
ELISE	Hello? :Why, are you calling? No...I... . Look, I have to go... She hangs up. David looks at her.
DAVID	What's wrong..
ELISE	That was my , ex. Adrian.
DAVID	Oh... I didn't-- I guess we hadn't gotten to that stuff yet...
ELISE	He hasn't called since we broke up.
DAVID	How long?
ELISE	Three months.
DAVID	Was it serious? An awkward beat. Elise opts for complete honesty.
ELISE	We were engaged.
DAVID	What happened? Complete honesty.
ELISE	He left... David can feel this in the pit of his stomach now.
DAVID	What an idiot.
ELISE	You don't know me that well yet. You're still in the wishful thinking phase. Truth is I should.;-Have left him a long time before he left me. It was a ,ain' l relationship. It hurt tb be i-h it every day.
DAVID	But it was:h'ard to leave.
ELISE	H& knew what buttons., tb push.
DAVID `'	that him? DtTid paints at pica re of Elise with an attractive man, arms
ELISE	David... . It's not... It's over between us. Completely over...I want to be clear about that. I'm pretty sure yesterday was the most perfect day I've ever had.
DAVID	Me too. David looks at the clock.
DAVID	I have this Diane Sawyer interview. It comes out awkward.
ELISE	I know. So did that. They look at each other. Then David reaches
ELISE	Can I come? My dress rehearsal's not until nine. David's face lights up.
ELISE	I'm afraid if I let you out of my sight. . .you know...I might never see you again... A smile creeps across his face...
DIANE SAWYER	You've overcome enormous obstacles in your life and risen to-such heights so quickly... People are fascinated by you.
DAVID	Only people who haven't spent enough time with ' me to know the 'truth.
DIANE SAWYER	As a speaker and politician you've been repeatedly compared to JFK.
DAVID	By my campaign manager mostly. You're the youngest person ever elected to Congress. Which you celebrated by getting in a bar fight on inauguration night.
DAVID	With a childhood friend. So I don't think that counts. And, truthfully, that's how we celebrate things we're I'm from.
DIANE SAWYER	Let's just say you have a habit of getting into the press for...other uniquely human things as well--
DAVID	that a euphemism, Diane? She laughs.
DIANE SAWYER	Most politicians... .run aw ay from the embarrassing things they've done Yoti,crack, jokes about them. You embrace, them. Especially since your.;, concession speech thr ee years ago which started as a `sstd-up routine and brought tears to my,eyes by the .,end when you talked about losing Your mother to Lancer and then your older brother,,Pdt, to an overdose, both whei.you:were only ten years old.
DAVID	I think Americans are tired of electing automatons whose every word and move is stage-managed so as not to offend anyone. I think they want somebody who doesn't hide who he is or what he really believes. I guess I'm hoping they want to elect someone who's actually like them. But I could be very wrong about that.
DIANE SAWYER	And if you are?
DAVID	You'd be surprised at the number of underwear companies that have approached me to be their spokesman. Diane bursts out laughing. The floor techs are laughing too.
DIANE SAWYER (ON TV)	Unfortunately, we're out of time. David Norris, announced his candidacy for US Senate yesterday. Thanks for stopping by. It goes to commercial. The- "stagehand" moves thecamera so it's blocking the window
ABC ID	Ma'am, Congressman Norris asked me to give you a message. We MOVE UP from his ID to REVEAL that the man is another one
THOMPSON AIDE #2 (ABC ID)	He was just called into a meeting that he says is urgent. He says he'll call you later and see you at your show tonight.
DIANE SAWYER	They're saying your girlfriend -- can we call her that? Is this one going to last more than a month?
DAVID	You can call her that. And yes. Definitely. David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks. It says:
DIANE SAWYER	They're saying she's getting a tour of the control room in studio C. Can somebody take Congressman Norris to studio C? Thompson's aide signals David to follow him. David does.
T HOMPSON'S AIDE #2	They said she was here... . Hang on. David pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal. He
DAVID	God dammit! But we can't hear a sound. PULL BACK to REVEAL Thompson's aide removing the"Studio C" 1) David across the room tugs on another exit. It's locked. 3) David slams on the door with a two-by-four. 1) Diane Sawyet talks about the issue of the day as we pull
VOICE	If people could hear you out there it wouldn't be a very good soundstage, would it? David turns to see Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit
THOMPSON	My name's Thompson.
DAVID	What happened to Free Will?
THOMPSON	Who said anything about Free Will? David stares back at him.
THOMPSON	You know, we actually tried Free Will before. After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire we stepped back to see how you'd do on your own. You gave us the Dark Ages -- for five centuries -- until finally we: decided we should come back in. The Chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off again. So we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revoluton.:ï¿½we spent six hundred years tempering your passions with reason.,then in 1910 we stepped ba ï¿½c again. Within fifty yearsï¿½you brought us World War I, the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the Holocaust ani capped it off by bringingtheentire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban Missile Crisis. A decisiOfl was taken atthat point that we' should stop in again before Â±ou did _soittething even we Cduldn't fix. You on't have_ Free Will, David, you have the appearance of Free =Will.
DAVID	You expect me.'to believe that? You have Free Will over what tie you pick in the morning, or what beverage to order at lunch. But humanity just isn't mature enough to have control over the important things.
DAVID	If you're in control of the important things then you're incompetent cause when I look around at the world these days it seems pretty fucked.
THOMPSON	It's still here. If we'd left things in your hands, it wouldn't be.
DAVID	Why are you trying to keep me from Elise? Or are you just another lackey who doesn't really know? Thompson studies David for a long beat. Then decides it's
THOMPSON	We put Elise in front of you three years ago to inspire you to, .g `ve that speech -- the speech that pulled you back from the brink of oblivion and, overnight, itiade.you the front runner for this coming election. The intervention on Charlie was to prevent the hedge fund you had just become vice chairman of from going belly up in the sub-prime=crisis, bringing two major banks down. with it, arid in , the process making you unelectable. David blinks. Tries to, process this... : .bAVID Are you s aying you warit me to win this election?
THOMP50N,	This 'one and six mom, after it. And t'm not just talking about `elections ' for Senate. lowly dawns on David what Thompson is saying...
THOMPSON	You can matter, David. Really matter. What you wanted your whole life. What your father wanted when he took you to the Senate gallery when you were ten. What your brother wanted when he made you promise, the day before he overdosed, that you wouldn't be like him.
DAVID	Stop. Don't tell me this.
THOMPSON	Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people. . .and that terrible emptiness when you're not?
DAVID	Stop.
THOMPSON	David you are meant to change the world. But that doesn't happen if you stay with her.
DAVID	Why does it matter to you who I love? Some skeleton of hers `is so bad I won't get elected? I don't believe that!
THOMPSON	It's not about her-:..it's about you, what being with her does to What does that mean?! I'm better with her than I ever was alone., You just said it. That speech--
1HOMPSON	Yes. The speech... Put it this wad: in small doses, Elise was the cure. But in large doses... When you're enthralledwith someone she ' rubs off on you:.
DA ID	Stop. Just: stop.
THOMPSON	David, the president can't be a
DAVID	Stop talking. It's not working. I'm a politician. I spend my life with professional liars. With people who decide what they want and then figure out the story they have to tell to get it.
THOMPSON	Why do you refuse to accept what should be completely obvious by now? You've seen what we can do. You can't doubt we are who we say we are.
DAVID	I don't care who you are. I don't care who's orders you're following.
THOMPSON	You can't outrun your fate, David.
DAVID	Who said anything about running.
THOMPSON	Maybe we should just reset you.
DAVID	We both know if you could have we wouldn't be standing here having this conversation... Thompson stares back. He's never dealt with such temerity...
THOMPSON	You fight us, we will take everything from you.
DAVID	You already did once.' And I'm still standing... always knew you were out there. We all do. It's the one thing we have in common. Whether we call it God or the Devil or Fate we all know you're out there, fucking with us...
THOMPSON	You'd still be living in caves if it weren't for us. You crush our dreams because they don't fit with your Plan. Your Plan that has no space for me falling in love but somehow has room for Tsunamis and cyclones and Darfur and AIDS. Fuck your plan. I reject it. I reject you.
DAVID (CONT'D)	The only thing we have in this fucked up world are the choices we make. And there's nothing you can do to me that will get me sign them away. Kill me. Or erase me. Or let me go. Thompson stares back at him, dumbfounded. A long silence,
THOMPSON	It's 6:20. If you leave now, you'll make Elise's show. David's eyebrows go up. Huh? Thompson is letting him go? The house lights come up half way as the stage is readied for
T-4 MPSON	She's a beautiful dancer.
DAVID	What do you want?
THOMPSON	There's one more piece to all this I haven't told you. I guess I didn't have the heart. If you stay with her, it doesn't just kill your dreams, it kills hers.
DAVID	What?
THOMPSON	Elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country... and eventually one of the greatest choreographers in the world. If she stays with you... she ends up teaching dance to eight year-olds.
DAVID	I don't believe you. I thought we already established that. A beat.
THOMPSON	When you look back at all this, David, just remember, we tried to reason with you. Thompson gets up and leaves...just as the lights go down for David watches him go...then turns around just in time to INSERT: a floor board tilted oddly. It goes back to normal. .A company staff member is examining Elise's ankle while the David arrives. Sees Elise's face. Tears streaming down her
ELISE	If it's broken...my career's over.
DAVID	Don't say that. Don't.
THOMPSON	I always hear people saying "you yourself for what can't bla M4' hpens fih other people," but in this case, really, you can. David stands up... . and punnhesThompson in `the face. h T ompson is knocked onto his ass. People in the waiting room stare at David. Almost everyone
THOMPSON	This is what you do, David. This is what you did the first night you got elected. This is what you did at that college reunion. We give you opportunities people would kill for and you squander them with impulse. It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly going to help you with that. You want to know why you can't have her? Look in the mirror. Thompson leaves.
ELISE	How bad is it? The surgeon turns to her with a classic doctor's detachment:
THOMPSON	You're an educated man. You've read the Greek tragedies`. In the end Fate always wins... David looks back at him in steely silence.
THOMPSON	It a sprain.
DAVID	Really?
THOMPSON	This time. Do you really want to watch her lose the only thing she's ever cared about? You just got the tiniest taste of what that looks like... The thought makes David ill.
THOMPSON	Walk away. If you truly love her, walk away. She'll hate you for it...but that way she'll be able to let you go quickly. You can give her that at least.
ELISE	It's a sprain! It's just a sprain! David gives her a tight hug.
ELISE	It's going to be okay. The doctor said it would heal in' a month. . .maybe even less.
DAVID	You're going to: be fine.
ELISE	They want to do an MRI...to assess the ligament. damage but.: -. They break from them hug.
DAVID	It's; going to be fine. And as incredible of a dancer as you already are, yot're just going to get better and better... DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling
DAVID	I...I have to go make a few calls. His voice cracks. Elise notices.
ELISE	You okay?
DAVID	I'm just...happy for you...
THOMPSON	You're doing the right thing, David. Not just for her, and the world. . .but for yourself. David looks at him for a beat, then turns and walks away into
LOCAL NEWS REPORTER (ON TV):	David Norris, who'has spent the last two days campaigning in the tri-lakes area, got some welcome news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll gave him a sixteen point lead over his opponent less than.a month before election dg t. FIND Charlie. He sits` at a booth eating breakfast as he Charlie glan ces out the window ad we FIND David standing on So etthing about his{,speaking style has changed. He's not as Just then a campaign aide arrives at Charlie's table.
CHARLIE	How's he doing?
CAMPAIGN AIDE	They still love him... Papers? The aide hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers,
CHARLIE	Thanks. The aide leaves. Charlie glances at the front page of the such astounding originality and virtuosity that it single-handedly reshapes. the. world of dance."
FOLLOW DAVID	As he makes his way, towards the diner'f-tom the parking lot, David sits down with Charlie.
DAVID	I'm started.
CHARLIE	I'm going to show you this because you'd find out eventually and because I want to be here when you do. Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it. Then Charlie points down near the bottom, at a particular "The show's choreographer, Adrian Troussant, and lead dancer, Elise Sellas, are partners on next week." David stares at the words...
CHARLIE	David? David?
DAVID	I think I need... I...
CHARLIE	Take a day off. Take a couple. We're sixteen points up. Even I can't blow a lead that big. Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes
DAVID	Do you still serve neighborhood guys here or just the tourists? The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar notice There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off
DAVID	Why are you here? REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.
HARRY	I would have come earlier but I had to wait for the rain. Water interferes with their ability to sense your decision tree. That's why we met on a boat last time. I guess I'm here to set the record straight.
DAVID	About what? Thompson was lying when he said they couldn't let you be with 8lise because :it would bring out your reckless side.
DAVID	Why, then? Why do they care so much?
HARRY	8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplause'and dreams of one day becoming p sident... if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.
HARRY	I've watched you a long time. They're right to want you in the White House. It would be good for the world. That's important but it can't be the only thing that matters.
DAVID	Why are you so different than they are? A long beat, then:
HARRY	You know, your Dad was a smart man. He could have been a lot more -- and he wanted to be. So did your brother. But the Plan didn't call for that. This hits David hard.
HARRY	In my job, you implement the Plan... And most of the time.. .you don't even know why... I'm sorry...
DAVID	My mom?
HARRY	That wasn't me... that wasn't us at all. David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink.
DAVID	When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or the White House I barely hesitated.
D1 ID	But the trt t i `is after making that choice I went into a free-fall... Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to see Thompson hurt her...but I used it as an excuse. I think I left her more to save my career than hers. Thompson wasn't lying. The press is already talking about me as a future president. I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm still sixteen points up in the polls.
HARRY	The public loves you.
DAVID	Before I met Elise that was all that mattered. Now I hardly notice. She's all I think about. Do you know where she's getting married?
HARRY	Front of a judge. Tomorrow morning.
DAVID	Is she happy with him? Tell me she is and I'll walk away.
HARRY	Thompson won't let you get near that courthouse.
DAVID	Harry... is she happy?
HARRY	No. A beat.
DW-ID	I have to get her back.. Harry knows how unlikely that is.
DAVID	Will you help me:ï¿½ Just help me get to her...
HARDY	They'll sense )tOu coming a mile away.'
DAVID	What if Icould move as fast as you can?
HARRY	What do you mean?
DAVID	Teach me about the doors.
HARRY	How do you know about that?
DAVID	The first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one.I thought it was a hallucination at first. Eventually I realized it's how you move around so fast. If you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you...okay, that's your choice. But if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine?
HARRY	Do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors... how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey?
DAVID	You know, when I do town hall meetings I usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when I walk, through' the door and when I start speaking. But when I'm done with the speech I can call on each one of them by `game. A beat...
HARRY	I've seen you do that The rain is supposed to stop in the nexthou'r. We're going to need all night to do this. And we're going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it.
MOMENTS LATER	Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the
HARRY	Put your hand on my shoulder. And don't let go until we've crossed the threshold. David complies. Harry opens the door.
DAVID	Are they ever locked?
HARRY	Maybe if you have a defective hat. They step through the door and onto--
HARRY	Hurry. Harry runs David to the front dooraf a brownstone. Opens
HARRY	We're underneath Canal Street, which c as ,,A canal before rt, was a street. This is the jcity's':pumping station for downtown Manhattan. We're ten blocks from the courthouse. Elise enters, smiles at the receptionist.
ELISE	Floor open?
RECEPTIONIST	You okay, sweetie?
ELISE	I just feel like being on the floor.
RECEPTIONIST	Everything still on for tomorrow? Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence.
HARRY	Lower Manhattan is a nightmare. Layer upon layer of substrate -- that's what we call the system of doors -- has been added over time. That makes it a lot more complex to navigate down here than it is uptown. And a lot slower. Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and
HARRY	You ready?
DAVID	Let's go. Harry smiles and hblds,.up a photograph of.the Manhattan
HARRY	Your destination. Courtroom Six.
DAVID	North Moore St. Just south of the coffee shop... Red door. I come out on Broadway, near Leonard St. Harry looks at a photo of what David just described.
HARRY	Good. Keep going.
DAVID	There's an alley in front of me. Third door on--
HARRY	Thompson's there.
DAVID	Okay ...so... I hightail it East-to Lafayette no, it's Crosby Street there. Elise dances.

'DAVID	Okay, you said he's right in front of me, right? Harry nods.
DAVID	I'd knock the Yankees cap off his head and go through the door before he has a chance to pick it up... A thinsmile forms on Harry's face and grows...
HARRY	Good... good... improvisation. We have trouble with that...
DAVID	How am I doing?
HARRY	Don't get cocky. You know ten permutations out of ten thousand. Get back to work.
MONTAGE	Harry drilling David with photd'after photo of Manhattan
HARRY	Yourbrain can only put so much in at once. Take- a brreak. Da :} , nods. His eyg6,0s' to: Harry' s leather Planbook. He
DAVID	Could I ever learn to read that? Harry shakes his head. Impossible.
DAVID	No matter how hard I tried?
HARRY	For the same reason you can't breathe underwater or flap your arms and fly. You're not built to do it.
DAVID	Is that me?
HARRY	Elise. Her decision tree. What it was a few hours ago, before the rain, before we were down here. David looks at it, then looks away.
DAVID	I want to ask you what it says.. .what she's thinking.. .bit somehow that feels ...wrong.
HARRY	You know what she's thinkin-g,'David -- as much as you need to know. The rest ...well...you're`built to feel that.
HARRY	ready to get back to work? Sometl`ing about that strikes Harry...
HARRY	Your father used to say that. Off David's reaction--
DAVID	The fastest path is getting to the blue door right off the bat...
HARRY	But you're exposed the whole way there. It's a lot riskier than leapfrogging through doors--
DAVID	But if I can make it...I'.Il have caught them completely bysurprise.
HARRY	Assuming you make it.
COURT REGISTRAR	Do you have your license? Adrian hands her his marriage license.
COURT REGISTRAR	Is your fiancee here?
ADRIAN	Getting out of a cab downstairs. The registrar glances at the license to make sure it's in
COURT REGISTRAR	Courtroom Six.
HARRY	You got lucky. It's raining again.
DAVID	The marriage is scheduled for ten minutes from now.
HARRY	You can't jump the gun on this,,.. Getting there too early is almost as bad as getting there too late. Harry looks at his updated Planbook and consults his watch.
HARRY	It ',.t time. David breathes a sigh of relief. Harry takes the hat off
DAVID	I'm going for the blue door.
HARRY	Of course... MUSIC CUE (something with relentless, pounding energy of the
HARRY	Run fast.
THOMPSON'S AIDE	It was a momentary flash, and given the weather we can't be sure, but it looks like Mr. Norris may be--
-THOMPSON	Do we have a proctor -at the wedding?!
ADRIAN	Hi, honey. You okay?
ELISE	Just a little queasy.
ADRIAN	Why?
ELISE	I'm not sure. Nervous... I just need a minute in the bathroom.
THOMPSON	Cars! Cars! From here it's faster in the cars!
THOMPSON	Where is heribw?! They jump in and the car peels out, followed by two others.
THOMPSON'S AIDE	Whoa!
THOMPSON	What? Thompson's Aide is speechless as he stares at his Planbook.
THOMPSON	What?
THOMPSON'S AIDE	He just went into the substrate... Off Thompson's reaction:
COURT CLERK	Docket #22 please come forward The guy next to Adrian stands up. Adrian: throws a panicked
ADRIAN	We're next. Will you check on her?
'DAM	It's an emergency.
NEW YORKER	We all have emergencies, pal. Are you David Norris?
ELISE	Am I making the biggest mistake of my life? I can't answer that question for you, Elise. But I will say--
ELISE LAUREN	I'm okay.
ELISE	I'm just nervous. You haven't done this yet. It's overwhelming...
ELISE	I'm okay. I'm going to clean up. Tell Adrian I'll be right there.
SECURITY OFFICER	Congressman! You left. your-- MOVE to REVEAL,a suspicious-looking man stepping into the
COURT CLERK	Docket #23 please come forward. Adrian looks at Lauren. Stands. Motions urgently for Lauren
LAUREN	David?!
DAVID	Where is she? Water drips from his clothes onto the marble floor.
LAUREN	You want to explain to me-- Where is she?! I'll . explain to her-- Lauren points at the 1-adies room. David nods "thanks" and
DAVID	Hi...
ELISE	Why are you doing this to me? Just then the door bursts open. The suspicious man from the
COURTROOM--	David elbows him in the face. The man drops.
ELISE	David! David calmly turns back to her.
DAVID	You're not supposed to be weeping on your wedding day, Elise. Elise fights the emotion again welling inside.
DAVID	You were never happy with Adrian. You told me that. Elise puts her head in her hands.
ELISE	This is so screwed up. Oh,-God..
DAVID	I love you. I know I've acted strangely. But, I love you.
ELISE	Don't do this to me.
DAVID	I've never felt anything like. this in my life.
ELISE	If you care 'so much, why the hell did you disappear on me in that hospital?
EL SE	What are you ha.d1 g from me? Why did you diS pp`ear " Again! You fucking bastard! Why? Tears are streaming down her face.
DAVID	They'll reset me...
DAVID	They'll scramble my brain--
ELISE	David, stop talking like this! Stop! David looks back at her... Just looks at her. Then he leans
DAVID	But at least you'll know the truth. I saw behind the curtain, Elise. I saw this. He opens up Harry's Planbook. Elise sees the intricate
DAVID	It's not in their "Plan" for us to be together. So they're trying to stop us.
THOMPSON'S AIDE	Oh myGod... He just revealed us.
ELISE	Stop talking like a crazy person. Stop making things up--
DAVID	They said if we were together they'`d take dance from you and politic,s,from me. They hurt your ankle that night. They-- The door flies open again. David picks up a trash can and
THOMPSON	Call the Intervention Team! Tell them it's a square-one reset!
ELISE	Jesus.. .the cops are after you?! David grabs the shield and uses it to wedge the door closed.
DAVID	He's not a cop. He's one of them. Another body slams into the door now. But the shield holds
ELISE	Who's "them?" SLAM! SLAM! The door cracks--
ELISE	Jesus, David!. What's going on?! David is impossibly calm. He puts his hat back on.
DAVID	I'm going to: show you. He takes Elise's hand, opens the bathroom door, and walks her Davidand Elise step? thhgtgh. a door onto a street in Soho.
DAVID	Come on... We need to lose them. David walks her across the street and picks a door at random,
DAVID	The rain slows them down but they can track us. We have two orthree minutes. Maybe less. Elise is still speechless. He takes her hand.
DAVID	The ten year-old in me always mixed up winning elections with being loved. Then I met` you;,.. The thing is, if they'd let me be with you I wouldn'tk have left politipe. t, just would have beef in it, or. all the right reasons. David pauses for a moment. He can see this' so clearly in his
DAVID	Now you know. Youknota everything. And you have to leave mitie. They'll take` dance from you. You saw what they-'did before. 'fihe foundations of her world have just collapsed... but
ELISE	No.
DAVID	You're not safe with me. If you She puts her finger to his lip. Shhhh...
ELISE	It doesn't make any sense but, right now I feel safer than I've ever felt before. I'm staying... An aide comes to The Chairman's--desk,.sets two open leather
AIDE TO-HE'"CHAIRMAN	Mr. Thompson has made an emergency request for the Intervention Team.. One of the folio .::documents is titled "Reset Authorization."
ELISE	Every door? tavid nods...as they walk into another... -- exit from a metal door in a stone facade. PULL BACK to Elise looks out at the harbor and the city. Rain pelts her
DRIVER OF SUBURBAN	The Intervention Team has pinpointed an interception point. Thompson circles his finger in the air to tell his men to
DAVID	Let's go.
ELISE	We can't keep running forever,. David.
DAVID	If they find us ...they'll take you from me.
ELISE	I won't let..them.
DAVID	They'll take you from here. David touches his head'.
ELISE	No, I won't let them. She leans,-.over and kisses hi's forehead.
DAVID	Perfect. David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It's

ELISE	Kiss me. Tears well in her eyes. And his.
ELISE	Close your eyes and kiss me. He does. And they kiss in the rain...
ELISE	I love you, David Norris. They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally,
THE CHAIRMAN	Hello, David... Good morning, Elise. His voice is gentle, paternal.
DAVID	Who are you?
THE CHAIRMAN	I think you know. David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.
DAVID	You can't oti{rn Fate... Tft , CHAIRMAN It's .more- complicated t,}an that, Fate am Free Will coexist They're;in tension with each other. And pure chance. A beat. David looks back at him... I could control 'everything. You'd be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets. I try to .keep things from getting too out of control. But that has a cost. Most people go through life like pinballs, reacting predictably to the stimuli I apply. They accept the path they find themselves on. And perform accordingly. But every once in a while someone comes along who refuses to be bound by his fate, someone who understands that Free Will is a gift most people are too afraid to use. Which, you see, is partly the point of all this. Or maybe you don't see it. Maybe you just feel it. And that's even better. Because that's the other part. David and Elise take it in...
DAVID	And all the misery, all the pain...
THE CHAIRMAN	I sit up there and I watch it and it hurts me... . but if you could see the incredible courage people show, the random acts of kindness, the love... If you could see huitan beings choosing every moment every day to be better thAn'' I made them, you would know it's all worthwhile. Good luck, David. And good luck to you, Elise. You're a-beautiful dancer. And so much more... The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.
THE CHAIRMAN	Their case isclosed.
AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN	But, Sir,isn't this a majtr. deviation from The Plan? The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
THE CHAIRMAN	Not anymc3e . David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by
DAVID	Maybe we should go dancing. A smile slowly spreads across her face ...
