CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
MARIA	Hey. Are you okay?
MARIA	Peter? What's the matter?
DOUG (O.S.)	Karen!
KAREN	I'll never get used to this.
DOUG	Maybe we should find a different train station.
KAREN	A public display of affection is considered rude in Japan. OMITTED
KAREN	What's that?
DOUG	We walk past this temple every day, Karen --
KAREN	Yeah, but I've never seen this before.
KAREN	It's a Buddhist ritual. The incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors, to help them remain at peace.
DOUG	It's amazing. You're like this infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or trivia. I'm not sure which.
KAREN	It's not trivia. It's what they believe. And it's far better, by the way, than your little pollution ritual.
KAREN	What?
DOUG	Nothing. I just -- I like that about you. You seem to be able to remember everything that's really important.
DOUG	Except the time.
KAREN	Oh, crap --
KAREN	C'mon, you're gonna be late.
KAREN	Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck. And I might have a vested interest in those years.
DOUG	Is that right?
KAREN	Maybe.
DOUG	Will I see you tonight?
KAREN	I'll call you when I get home.
DOUG	Fourteen. I hate odd numbers.
2d 2d	Through the front doors, we see Doug kiss Karen again. They
ALEX	Karen!
ALEX	
KAREN	I just came by to pick up some books I left here. I'm not scheduled to work today --
ALEX	I know. But are you free? Do you have class?
KAREN	Just a test to study for. Why?
ALEX	Your wish has been granted.
ALEX	It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and I can't reach her at home. She must be sick, or something. And she has the damn house key.
KAREN	What's this phrase?
ALEX	"Mild dementia with severe lethargy." Apparently she sleeps through most of the day. Her daughter-in-law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there.
ALEX	You're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own. Besides, it's an English-only house.
ALEX	Here's the address. Use the wall chart if you need help -- and don't forget to bring a map.
ALEX	Don't worry Karen, you're ready. OMITTED
5a 5a	Karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through
KAREN	Hello? Mrs. Williams?
KAREN	Is anyone here? Karen stands in the doorway, surveying the room. The place
KAREN	Oh my God... are you alright? -- Emma sits on the back porch, staring vacantly. But her
KAREN	Okay, Emma. Let's try again: my name is Karen. Do you remember? I'm from the Health Center. I'm substituting for Yoko, just for today.
KAREN	Looks like you need a new Band-Aid. How'd this happen, Emma? Would you like a bath? Maybe that will help you feel better. Karen turns on the water, puts the stopper over the drain.
KAREN	It's okay, Emma. Karen uses a sponge to bathe Emma, her robe rolled to her
KAREN	Nice one, Karen. Karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. She
KAREN	How did you get up there? Karen steps into the hallway and listens. There it is again,
KAREN	Hello? The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER Karen is on her cell phone:
KAREN (INTO PHONE)	Yes, he was shut in a closet! There was tape around the -- No, they're not home yet. I don't know, Emma hasn't said a word to me -- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes, alright, Alex. Just please get here as soon as you can.
KAREN (IN JAPANESE)	Hello there.
Really creepy.	The boy just stares at her. My name is Karen. What's yours?
THE BOY	Toshio. Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the
MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE)	"Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer aren't around, leave a message."
SUSAN (ON MACHINE)	"Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are you there? Pick up...
SUSAN (ON MACHINE) (cont'd)	Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so you can try my cell, or just call me at home later."
SUSAN (ON MACHINE)	"I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay. Yesterday was... a bit weird, and -- I'm just a little worried."
SUSAN (ON MACHINE)	"Listen, just give me a call when you can, okay?"
EMMA (O.S.)	...I've told them over and over... I've told them over and over...
KAREN	Emma, who were you talking to?
EMMA	I just want her to leave me alone.
KAREN	You should get some rest, Emma. MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly,
MATTHEW	You're up?
JENNIFER	Mmmmmm.
MATTHEW	I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been sleeping ever since we got here.
JENNIFER	Not at night.
JENNIFER	I told you, Matthew, you can sleep through anything.
MATTHEW	I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was probably just the move -- I'm sure she'll get back on schedule.
MATTHEW	You seen my travel mug?
JENNIFER	I didn't unpack it yet.
MATTHEW	Maybe you should say something to the helper, what's her name?
JENNIFER	Yoko.
MATTHEW	Who knows? Maybe there's something she can suggest.
JENNIFER	Yeah. Maybe.
MATTHEW	I miss seeing this every morning. No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking
MATTHEW	Hey, kiddo. You okay?
JENNIFER	I went for a walk yesterday. Just to explore. I got lost and couldn't find anyone who could speak English, who could help me. I felt so... stupid.
MATTHEW	This will get easier soon, for Mom, for all of us. I promise.
JENNIFER	Or else?
MATTHEW	Or else I'll tell the company it's just not working out, and that we're going back to the States with or without my old job. They can get someone else to crunch their numbers.
MATTHEW	But until then -- promise me you'll give it a good try, okay Jen?
JENNIFER	Deal.
MATTHEW	Is this Yoko's bike?
JENNIFER	I think so.
MATTHEW	It's been here all night.
MATTHEW	I'll probably be home late, maybe around nine or so.
JENNIFER	I knew you'd forget.
JENNIFER	Dinner, your sister? At seven?
MATTHEW	Oh yeah. Right.
JENNIFER	You were going to cook.
MATTHEW	I have a big conference. They usually run long.
JENNIFER	I'll do the shopping. Just call me if you're going to be late. CLOSE ON the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now
JENNIFER	If you need something, all you have to do is say so --
JENNIFER	Who's -- who's there?
MATTHEW	Sorry I'm late, it took awhile to wrap things up.
MATTHEW	Jen? Susan? Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its
MATTHEW	What the hell? --
MATTHEW	Mom? Are you alright?
MATTHEW	Where's Jennifer, Mom?
MATTHEW	Did Yoko come today, Mom? Remember? The pretty girl?
MATTHEW	Jen? Are you up there?
MATTHEW	Dammit.
MATTHEW	Jennifer? What is it --
MATTHEW	What's wrong? What happened???
MATTHEW	I'll... I'll call an ambulance... Matthew runs into the kitchen grabbing A LARGE BOOK on one of
MATTHEW	Dammit!
MATTHEW	Jesus Christ...
MATTHEW	`Ambulance'... "kyukyusha".
MATTHEW	Who are you? What -- what are you doing here? The DOORBELL rings. Then a few more times.
SUSAN	Hello?
SUSAN	You guys in the kitchen? Susan walks in, puts the wine on the table. Looks around.
SUSAN	I thought you guys were gonna cook!
SUSAN	Hi, Mom. How are you feeling?
SUSAN	I guess I came at a bad time, huh?
SUSAN	I'll give you guys one minute to finish whatever you're doing up there and get your butts down here.
SUSAN	I mean it, guys.
SUSAN	Well, I warned you. Prepare to be emotionally scarred.
SUSAN	Matthew! Don't scare me like that!
SUSAN	What's going on? Where's Jennifer?
MATTHEW	She went out. Something came up.
SUSAN	I hope she's not long. I'm absolutely starving.
SUSAN	I knew it. You guys forgot to go shopping, didn't you?
MATTHEW	I'm sorry. This is a bad time.
SUSAN	Are you okay? What's going on?
MATTHEW	You should go.
SUSAN	Did something happen? What's --
MATTHEW	She doesn't love me... she never loved me...
SUSAN	What are you talking about?
SUSAN	Stop it, Matthew.
MATTHEW	Leave me alone.
SUSAN	Matthew, please --
MATTHEW	GO AWAY!!! It's an overcast afternoon. Swollen clouds hang low over
SUSAN	This is Suzuki-san, he's the Real Estate broker.
MATTHEW	What did he say?
SUSAN	He said: "welcome to Tokyo". And that you must be very important to your company for them to rent this place for you.
SUSAN	Your shoes.
MATTHEW	Oh. Right.
JENNIFER	Even in our own house?
SUSAN	Even in your own house. Suzuki opens the blinds, letting some light into the place.
MATTHEW	Isn't the layout great? Wait `till you see the back room. It's perfect for Mom -- she won't have to deal with the stairs.
MATTHEW	Her bed won't be here until next week, but we can put the mattress on the floor. What do you think?
SUSAN	He says no one has lived in this house for three years.
JENNIFER	Why?
SUZUKI	Ex-pen-sive.
MATTHEW	Where's Mom?
44a 44a	Susan comes up the stairs, worried.
SUSAN	Mom? Where are you? Did you get her?
SUSAN	Take a pill, will ya?
SUSAN	C'mon, Mom. You know what the doctor said about stairs.
MATTHEW	She okay?
SUSAN	Mom? What is it? Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the
MATTHEW	It's perfect. We'll take it.
MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE)	"Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer aren't around, leave a message."
SUSAN (INTO PHONE)	Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are you there? Pick up... Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so you can try my cell, or just call me at home later.
SUSAN (INTO PHONE)	I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay. Yesterday was...
SUSAN (INTO PHONE) (cont'd)	a bit weird, and -- I'm just a little worried. Listen, just give me a call when you can, okay? The hallway is chilly -- Susan shivers. She's about to start
SUSAN	Is anybody there?
SUSAN (IN JAPANESE)	In the stairs... there was... something... a strange person... all the lights were going out...
SUSAN	Please. Help me.
GUARD (IN JAPANESE)	I'll take a look. Wait here. OMITTED Susan bursts out of the security room and runs through the
SUSAN (INTO PHONE)	Hello?
MATTHEW (PHONE)	It's me. Matthew! Are you alright?
MATTHEW (PHONE)	I'm downstairs. What number are you again?
SUSAN (INTO PHONE)	702. I'll buzz you in.
SUSAN	I don't know what you're up to, but this is not cool --
62a 62a	-- slowly walks into THE KITCHEN. She reaches out and turns
SUSAN	Please... stop it... Karen's CELL PHONE lays on the table in the foreground.
ALEX	Karen?
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	I can handle this myself, you know. It's just a routine call. I don't know why you wanted to come. The house feels completely different: all the interior
NAKAGAWA	I am Detective Nakagawa. This is Detective Igarashi, my assistant.
ALEX	Is Karen okay?
NAKAGAWA	She is very shaken. We would like her to stay in the hospital tonight, under evaluation.
NAKAGAWA	Do you know these people?
ALEX	Matthew Williams, and his wife Jennifer. He's Emma's son, the woman Karen came here to see.
NAKAGAWA	When was the last time you saw him?
ALEX	I met them when they came to register. It's standard procedure, though the visits were arranged by his employer. He works at --
NAKAGAWA	We've spoken with his employer. He did not show up for work today.
NAKAGAWA	If you could please come by tomorrow to make a statement, the address is there, at the bottom --
ALEX	Yoko.
NAKAGAWA	I'm sorry?
ALEX	Karen was a substitute -- Yoko is the girl who is normally in charge of Emma. She's also been missing from work.
NAKAGAWA	For how long?
ALEX	For the last two days.
ALEX	I think I saw her bike outside.
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	That's Matthew's sister.
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	This must be her.
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Call her at work, then at home. If no one answers, send someone to -- Nakagawa and Igarashi enter from the hallway, followed by I need your flashlight. God!
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	What the hell... what is going on? What is that? The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd. The
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	Who does this belong to?
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	We don't know.
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	I can use the blood to help identify the person.
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Is it possible that someone could live without... that?
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	I certainly hope not.
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	Someone just reported another death. It's not in our district... but I think we should check it out.
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Why?
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	The cause of death is not clear... but it is the man who sold them this house. CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a bicycle. A familiar one. Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes.
YOKO	Hi, excuse me?
YOKO	Emma? It's Yoko. I'm coming in.
YOKO	Hi, Emma. It's good to see you again.
YOKO	My name is Yoko.
YOKO	You should be in bed --
YOKO (IN JAPANESE)	You shouldn't be playing with this! OMITTED Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders. She looks around,
DOUG	It's okay. I've got you.
DOUG	Your boss told me what happened. I'm sorry.
DOUG	I talked to your teachers. They said you can take as much time as you need. We could go to Kyoto for a weekend, see those temples you're always talking about.
KAREN	Running away won't help.
DOUG	There's nothing to run away from, Kat. No one blames you for what happened.
KAREN	I'm not even sure what did happen.
DOUG	You went to help someone who was, quite simply, beyond help.
KAREN	No, that's not what I mean...
KAREN	That house. There was something...
DOUG	Don't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth, Kat. An old woman passed away in her sleep. It's sad, but that's all it is --
KAREN	Is that how they said she died?
DOUG	I'm sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in a way, it will help you later. Death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career. There's no avoiding it. Maybe now you'll be more... ready for it.
KAREN	I don't think I'll ever be ready for something like that.
NAKAGAWA	I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss Davies. I was wondering if you could answer some additional questions?
DOUG	I'm Doug. Karen's boyfriend.
DOUG	You up for this?
KAREN	Why don't you find out when I can check out of here.
NAKAGAWA	How are you feeling?
KAREN	Okay. Tired.
NAKAGAWA	You are an exchange student? And you have been volunteering at the Health Center for...?
KAREN	Three months. I needed a social welfare credit.
NAKAGAWA	You said this was the first time you'd been in that house?
KAREN	Yes.
NAKAGAWA	About the Japanese boy you said you saw there --
KAREN	Did you find him?
NAKAGAWA	No, not yet. You said the boy had been taped into the closet?
KAREN	Yes, that's right. He was... holding a cat. A black cat. There was a book in the closet, too. I think it was a journal.
NAKAGAWA	Did it belong to the boy?
KAREN	I don't think so. I think it belonged to a woman.
KAREN	The writing. It looked feminine.
KAREN	I left it on the kitchen table.
NAKAGAWA	I didn't see any book on the table. Perhaps someone moved it. Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet?
KAREN	I asked him his name. He said `Toshio'.
NAKAGAWA	One more question, please.
NAKAGAWA	We found this in the room where...
KAREN	This is him. This is the boy.
NAKAGAWA	Are you certain?
KAREN	Yes. Positive.
KAREN	Detective Nakagawa?
KAREN	The whole time I was in that house, I felt something was... wrong.
KAREN	What happened there?
NAKAGAWA	The bodies of the son and daughter- in-law of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic.
NAKAGAWA	It seems that the son killed his wife, and then himself --
NAKAGAWA	Please excuse me for a moment. IN THE HALLWAY: the men speak with hushed voices.
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	We checked the apartment of Susan, the sister. She wasn't there...
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Yes? The chain lock had been drawn from the inside. And the deadbolt. But we found no one in the apartment.
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Get the surveillance tapes from the office building.
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	They were the first family to live in that house since the incident three years ago --
KAREN	Toshio... The place is quiet, completely deserted. Except for --
ALEX	Yoko?
ALEX	What... What happened, Yoko?
ALEX	Say something, please...
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Hello?
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Have you determined a cause of death?
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	Not yet. The blood on his body -- isn't his. It belongs to her. I don't understand. He killed Yoko, before he died?
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	The jawbone you found in the attic yesterday with the American couple belongs to this girl. I estimate it was -- removed -- from her body two or three days ago.
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)	But I thought you said her body was found with this man, tonight. The Coroner nods. Eyes on his shoes.
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	Then how did she get from the house to the Health Center?
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	I have no idea.
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)	She survived for two days without this?
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	It would seem so. How is that possible?
CORONER (IN JAPANESE)	I don't believe it is.
DOUG	I got us a guidebook to Kyoto. I thought maybe we'd leave tomorrow --
KAREN	Why didn't you tell me?
DOUG	Tell you what?
KAREN	About the bodies they found in the attic.
DOUG	You were recovering from a shock. I didn't want to --
DOUG	Karen -- wait --
100a 100a	Karen paces down the hall towards a RECEPTION AREA. Doug
DOUG	Look, I'm sorry. I was just worried about you, and -- I know you, Karen.
KAREN	The same thing happened three years ago, Doug. To a Japanese family, who lived in that house. They were all found dead.
DOUG	So you think the events are connected?
KAREN	How would you explain it?
DOUG	Okay. How about this: the American family knew about what had happened there before, and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events.
DOUG	It's exactly how superstitions survive: if you walk under a ladder and think uh-oh, you're in for some bad luck, sure enough, what do you know? You trip over --
KAREN	-- trip over the curb and sprain your ankle.
DOUG	Makes sense, right?
KAREN	Okay. Then explain this: when I went to that house, I didn't know anything about its past. But yet I still saw...
DOUG	Saw what? Karen?
KAREN	Emma and I were alone in that room, but -- there was something else there. I'm sure of it.
DOUG	You watched a woman die, Kat. That's a horrible thing to experience. I can't imagine how you must feel. But sometimes the mind tries to cope with terrible things in a way that distorts what actually occurred.
KAREN	You might be right, Doug. But I know what I saw. I think I know what I saw...
DOUG	You just need to rest. We'll get you home, get a good night's sleep.
KAREN	Yeah.
KAREN	You've got class, and I'm sure I only have to fill out a few forms or something --
DOUG	You sure?
KAREN	I'm fine, Doug. Really.
OFFICER #1 (IN JAPANESE)	This just came in. It's the surveillance video you requested. Nakagawa stands at the front door. Gathering his courage. Nakagawa's eyes widen as the door swings open. He sees --
DOUG	I come bearing gifts.
KAREN	That's the boy who was there yesterday. In that house. But this boy, he's --
KAREN	-- he's supposed to be dead.
KAREN	I saw him, Doug. I talked to him. He told me his name. A boy who was killed by his father three years ago told me his name.
KAREN	You don't believe me.
DOUG	How can I believe you, Karen?
KAREN (INTO PHONE)	Hello?
KAREN	What?
KAREN	Alex and Yoko are dead.
KAREN	There's something wrong with that house, Doug. Something really bad. The boy in that house, he had a photo of this man. He died on that same day three years ago. I need to talk to his wife... widow. If I can find out what happened, or if... maybe --
DOUG	Maybe, what?
DOUG	I'm concerned about you going out while you're so upset --
KAREN	You don't understand. I have to, Doug.
DOUG	Why?
KAREN	Because I've been inside that house, Doug. Don't you get it? I've been inside!
KAREN	I love you. But I have to go.
MARIA (INTERCOM, IN JAPANESE)	Yes?
KAREN	I'm looking for Maria Kirk?
MARIA (INTERCOM)	Who is this?
KAREN	My name is Karen Davies. I'm a student at -- I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
KAREN	Ms. Kirk? Questions about what?
KAREN	I'm here because... I need to speak with you about your husband. Leave me alone.
KAREN	Maria -- Please.
MARIA	I'm late for work.
KAREN	I just need a couple minutes.
MARIA	Make yourself at home.
MARIA	Well?
KAREN	Your husband, Peter. Three years ago he...
MARIA	He what?
KAREN	He killed himself.
KAREN	I'm... sorry.
MARIA	Thank you.
MARIA	How did you know Peter?
KAREN	I didn't.
MARIA	Then what are you doing here?
KAREN	I think there's a connection between your husband's death and something that happened to me.
MARIA	What happened to you?
KAREN	It's... hard to explain.
KAREN	Look, I know this sounds strange, but... I don't think your husband wanted to die.
MARIA	Then why would he throw himself out a window?
MARIA	Let me guess: `hard to explain'?
MARIA	I put all this behind me. I don't want to open it back up again.
KAREN	If that's true, then why are you still here in Japan?
MARIA	Because I can't leave. I tried. But I couldn't. Not without...
MARIA	He usually didn't wake up before me. But that morning, he did. He made coffee for us. Then he sat there and waited for me to wake up. And when I did, he looked me right in the eye. And then he jumped. The night before we'd been talking about having children together...
KAREN	Did you know a woman named Kayako?
MARIA	No.
KAREN	Did Peter?
MARIA	I don't think so.
KAREN	Maybe it was someone he worked with?
MARIA	Look. I've had the police up here, I talked with Detectives, I even hired a P.I.-- I don't know what you're going through, or what you think you know about my husband. But I don't have any answers. I'm sorry.
KAREN	Please. I don't know what else to do. Please help me.
MARIA	This is all his stuff from school.
MARIA	This was our first date.
KAREN	Oh my God.
MARIA	What? Did you find something?
PETER	Happy Monday.
CO-WORKER	Yeah, right. Here's your mail.
CO-WORKER	Another one, huh?
PETER	I don't even know her. She says I used to tutor her, but I don't know who the hell she is. Peter stands in front of The House.
PETER (IN JAPANESE)	Hello? Excuse me?
PETER (IN JAPANESE)	Hello.
PETER (IN JAPANESE)	My name is Peter. I'm here to see your mother. Is she home?
PETER (IN JAPANESE)	Hey! Are you okay??? Hello??? Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited.
PETER (IN JAPANESE)	Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in. OMITTED Are you alright?
PETER (IN JAPANESE)	Are you alone? Where are your parents?
PETER (IN JAPANESE)	What happened to you?
KAREN (IN JAPANESE)	Excuse me, I need to speak with Detective Nakagawa.
KAREN (IN JAPANESE)	It's an emergency.
OFFICER #2 (IN JAPANESE)	One moment.
AOKI (IN ENGLISH)	You are asking for Detective Nakagawa?
KAREN	Yes, I have important information for him about a case...
AOKI	Detective Nakagawa is not here right now. Can you tell me what case this is regarding?
KAREN	His partner, Detective Igarashi? Can I speak with him?
AOKI	Can you tell me your name, please?
KAREN	They're dead, aren't they?
AOKI	Miss, wait please -- A reading light on the computer desk provides the only
KAREN	Doug?
DOUG (ON MACHINE)	"Hey, Karen. It's me. I just wanted to say -- I'm sorry. I know I wasn't hearing you.
DOUG (ON MACHINE) (cont'd)	If all this is real to you, then it's important to me, and I'm gonna check that house out. So just sit tight, I won't be long. I love you."
KAREN	No. Doug stands at the gate, lighting a cigarette, looking down
DOUG	Hello? Karen runs towards us, breathless, stopping as she reaches --
KAREN	Doug! Where are you???
KAREN	Doug???
VOICE (O.S.)	Hey, Maria, it's me. Yeah, I'm still at school...
PETER (INTO PHONE)	...I know, I'm sorry -- these staff meetings always run over -- maybe another ten minutes or so -- okay, I'll be home soon -- I love you too.
PETER	Guess your mom's late, huh?
PETER	Toshio! We have to --
KAREN	Oh my God... He takes a step back and looks -- That came from upstairs. THUMP. Karen looks up as the sound continues. We PAN OVER towards
KAREN	No more... please, no more...
KAREN	DOUG! NO!!! The flashing lights of POLICE CARS wash over the formerly
132c 132c	...the light CHANGES. Darkness becomes morning sunlight
132d 132d	It's the most beautiful we've ever seen it. A lush
