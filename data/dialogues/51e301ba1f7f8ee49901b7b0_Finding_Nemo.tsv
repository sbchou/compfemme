	Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.
	Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your deliver or did he deliver?
	man delivered.
	it wasn't so easy.
	a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.
	better believe they did--every single one of them.
	You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.
	you do like it, don't you?
	no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
	honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
	you're gonna wake the kids.
	right. Right.
	look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.
	wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
	like Nemo.
	Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.
	think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!
	What if they don't like me?
	
	really.
	over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.
	
	remember how we met?
	I try not to.
	I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'
	
	away!
	he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?
	Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get
	
	Coral?
	Oh!
	There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will let anything happen to you...Nemo.
	day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!
	don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.
	you, dad. Me!
	
	up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
	right, I'm up.
	boy--whoa!
	
	day of school!
	Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.
	
	you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?
	
	you woozy?
	
	many stripes do I have?
	fine.
	the stripe question!
	
	See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
	
	see.
	you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
	on, dad. It's time for school.
	Forgot to brush.
	
	you want this anemone to sting you?
	
	
	I'm done.
	missed a spot.
	
	Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!
	right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
	not safe.
	my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
	
	right. Come on, boy.
	maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!
	you ever met a shark?
	and I don't plan to.
	old are sea turtles?
	turtles? I don't know.
	Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
	you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
	you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?
	that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.
KIDS	mom!
MOM	pick you up after school.
KID	on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!
	on, we'll try over there.
	me, is this where we meet his teacher?
	look who's out of the anemone.
	Shocking, I know.
	right?
	
	
	
	Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.
	yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.
	actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
	come on, clownie.
	do something funny.
	
	right, I know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
	Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!
	
JOHANSSEN	right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?
	dad...can I go play too? Can I?
	would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.
	where I would play
	wrong with his fin?
	looks funny!
	Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?
	nice. It's his first time at school.
	was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.
	
	this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
	H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]
	obnoxious.
RAY	Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the
	Ray!

	you better stay with me.
RAY	bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and
RAY	I wonder where my class has gone?
RAY	there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so
	you can go now.
RAY	hello. Who is this?
	Nemo.
RAY	Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.
	
RAY	live in what kind of home?
	anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--
RAY	okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!
	so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
	it's time for you to go now.
RAY	worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
	man!
RAY	
	Nemo!
	dad!
	son! Be safe.
	you're doing pretty well for a first timer.
	you can't hold onto them forever, can you?
	I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.
	just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
	Marty. Calm down.
	tell me to be calm, pony boy!
	boy'?
	know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.
	
RAY	Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species
	
RAY	There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora,
RAY	the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food
RAY	the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps]
	on, let's go.
RAY	on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa,
	guys, wait up! Whoa.

	know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
	
	That's a pretty big butt.
	look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!
	yeah? Let's see you get closer.
	Beat that.

	my dad says it's not safe.
	no!
	
	were about to swim into open water!
	I wasn't go out--but dad!
	was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--
	he wasn't gonna go.
	he was too afraid.
	I wasn't.
	does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out know you can't swim well.
	can swim fine, dad, okay?
	it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
	dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--
	you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do but you just can't, Nemo!
	hate you.
RAY	to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
	sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little

	it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.
	memory loss..I don't believe this!
	it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
	wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]

	Hey!
	gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
	whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.
	fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!
	there has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here.
	Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. is it with men and asking for directions?
	I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
	wanna get outta here, don't you?
