CHARLIE	You want me to take you apart, huh? Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I will. I'll sell you for parts. Don't think I won't-- Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
DORIS	Nothing doing, huh?
CHARLIE	The thing's got no ambition. Can I -- uh, give you a hand?
DORIS	I got it. Thanks. She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across
JANE	Don't leer at the neighbors, kid. Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship
CHARLIE	She's the one who put a word on her butt. I'm just reading it. Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
JANE	Is he ever going to move that thing?
CHARLIE	You need to get over it, Mom. Attitude. You've been tense or something. School?
CHARLIE	School's great, actually.
JANE	Amy?
CHARLIE	Good. Hasn't dumped me yet. He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.
JANE	That'll teach you to get so tall and handsome. Getting what you want is stressful. Especially when you're not used to it. More to lose.
CHARLIE	Are you reading those books again? The Power of Whatever the Hell? She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	They're not working. You're still flipping out about a big box. Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
JANE	It's an eyesore. I'm trying to convince people to move in, not join the legions leaving town--
CHARLIE	If you say "mortgage crisis" again I'm getting a new mom.
JANE	The guy moves in and puts a giant trash can in his yard! When the Perry's lived there-- Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.
CHARLIE	The Perry's were the greatest neighbors ever. But they moved. I thought you were happy their place finally sold.
JANE	He's not digging a pool. Where do you think all that concrete's coming from?
CHARLIE	You're spying on the guy now?
JANE	He's thirteen feet from our house. That's not spying, that's observing. A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot
AMY	Hi, Mrs. Brewster.
JANE	Hi honey. Hi girls. ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful But Charlie is. And he can't believe his luck. Which puts Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.
JANE (CONT'D)	Oh hey -- Ed called. Again.
CHARLIE	Okay.
JANE	I'm tired of making excuses, Charlie. If you don't want to talk to him, would you please tell him?
CHARLIE	Kinda defeats the purpose. He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.
AMY	Still can't get the bike started, huh?
CHARLIE	Wow. No faith.
AMY	So you don't need a ride. Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs
CHARLIE	No, hey, stop-- She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she Come on! Hey!-- Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst. The
ON JANE	Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit. Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the
BEE	Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck.
AMY	Charlie.
BEE	Chuck likes it when I call him Chuck, right Chuck? Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort.
CHARLIE	It's -- they're not -- that's, like, puce? That's a macho puce.
CARA	Can you stop someplace? I'm severely under-caffeinated.
AMY	Did you see the poster for the formal? The theme is "Hope"?
BEE	I know. They asked me to be on the committee again but I was like -- hope is completely 2008. Grow up.
CHARLIE	Did you suggest "Despair?" Nobody would see that coming. Or -- global warming? Everybody has to wear tin foil.
AMY	Did you go last year? We basically did the whole thing, Bee and me. Me? I, ah, was in training that week. This big triatha--
BEE	Chuck was still under his rock. We're so glad you crawled out.
CARA	Caffeine!? Hello!
CHARLIE	I have Econ first period. Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.
CARA	Charrrliiieeeee. Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal. Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out.
CARA	Thank you, Jesus. Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.
AMY	You're not going to flunk for missing Econ, Brain.
CHARLIE	Brain? I -- what? No, I'm-- But she's already walking away.
AMY	Five minutes. He watches her move off, anxious and smitten. Kids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school. Amy
AMY	On time. You stress too much.
CHARLIE	I wasn't worried.
AMY	You were doing your worried thing.
CHARLIE	I was? I have a -- what's my-- Ladies! A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up The cool kids.
BEE	Doods. Looking massive.
MARK	Seriously? A Mochachino? You can't ride with the girls anymore. You let them brush your hair, My Pretty Pony? Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it.
BEE	Chuck's secure, aren't you? We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design.
CHARLIE	Puce.
BEN	Fuck yeah. I have track after school, maybe we can hook up later?
CHARLIE	Yeah. Hey. Come here. You know, the formal. Don't think I wasn't going to ask you, because I thought it was an obvious go. Together. Hope, puppies, kittens, the whole deal. You and me. Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to the dance senior year. She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath.
CHARLIE	Right. I knew that. MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow.
MARK	Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp man? Make a sacrifice to the hot ass Gods? How do you get that?
CHARLIE	Game, my friend. Rock solid. Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we
MARK	You don't even have a car!
TEACHER	Ben Wegner?
BEN	Here.
TEACHER	Adam Noris? Nothing. Teacher looks around.
TEACHER (CONT'D)	Adam? Courtney Heuer? A girl raises her hand. Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And
TEACHER (CONT'D)	Nick Straley? Nick? Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly
MARK	Miss Granada. Geometry.
CHARLIE	Holy crap. Where did you get that?
MARK	She's hard up, man. Equations don't keep you warm at night. They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and
BEN	I think "it's" going to talk to us. I need a minute.
MARK	"It's" going to talk to Brewster. When are you going to get the message? We don't know you-- He does. Or did. Before the summer and his Jock Lobotomy.
CHARLIE	What's the deal, man?
ED	Alone. Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out
MARK	Just the two of you. That's sweet. He can school you in the ways of geek-douchery.
ED	It's important. "Brewster." The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.
ED (CONT'D)	Adam's missing. Charlie's looking around, self-conscious.
CHARLIE	What do you mean, he's missing?
ED	I keep trying him -- nothing. No texts, no phone. And he's not the only one who's gone. You heard roll call.
CHARLIE	So kids aren't coming to school. What do you want me to do about it?
ED	Meet me at his house after school. We'll check around. See what's up, if he's okay.
CHARLIE	I can't after school. I'm busy.
ED	I don't think you get what I'm
CHARLIE	Look, do we have to do this here? Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He
ED	What, am I not even suppose to speak to you now?--
CHARLIE	Keep it down. Don't spaz--
ED	It's so horrible! Crossing the streams! Will High School as we know it cease to exist?! Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.
ED (CONT'D)	You want me to tell your pals how well we know each other? The Lego contests, the Farscape conventions,
ED	Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine--
CHARLIE	No. No.
ED	Then be my backup. Fine. Adam's after school.
ED	Don't be late. Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from
AMY	You know what I want? For dinner?
CHARLIE	You're eating right now, you know. As you speak. You literally just forced me to get you a smoothie so large they named a planet after it-- I ran six miles. What did you do?
CHARLIE	I -- watched you. But not in a creepy way. Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.
AMY	So don't judge. You don't want me to burn my big ole' booty off, do you? Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her.
AMY (CONT'D)	What was that for?
CHARLIE	I don't know you're just...
AMY	What? Nothing. A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real. PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome
AMY	Wow.
CHARLIE	Look at Mom. She'sâ
AMY	Damn right. If he followed her home, you have to let her keep him. Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment.
ADAM	Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's. Remember the videos we all made back when? You and me and Adam, bro? In tights. Want your pals to get a load of that?
JANE	.so not a pool, what's the work you're doing? Jerry has an easy-going way about him. An inviting charm.
JERRY	Foundation problems. I had to rip up half the basement.
JANE	These houses were built practically overnight. I'm never surprised when they come apart. Done. Just needed a new stem. Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping.
JANE	Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And his -- do we say girlfriend now? I guess. I mean -- only if she's-- Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him.
AMY	Hi. I'm Amy. He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She
CHARLIE	Hey.
JANE	Jerry's our new neighbor. The Perry place. He's "handy."
AMY	No kidding.
JERRY	Sorry about the mess, man. I was just telling your mom I'll have the dumpster gone next week.
CHARLIE	Doesn't bother me.
JANE	Jerry does night construction on the strip.
JERRY	You play ball? I'm always looking for a pick up game. Now and then, you know.
JANE	It's more of a collector thing. The shoes. He's obsessed. They sleep on sidewalks to get them. Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me.
JERRY	Well -- they're bold. I like them. Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.
JERRY (CONT'D)	So... I'd ask you guys inside, but it's a mess. I've been meaning to.
JANE	Be neighborly.
JERRY	A drink, something. It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles.
JERRY (CONT'D)	Soon, okay?
JANE	You bet. And thank you so much. For the help.
JERRY	Least I could do. Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves
AMY	Why did you blow him off? Oh my God!
JANE	A guy that good-looking, still single? Bad bet. He's a player. Mom. Breaking it down.
JANE	I've had enough man trouble. I'm not getting suckered again. Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices.
JANE (CONT'D)	Don't listen to me. Jaded old Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it.
ON THE PHONE	A VIDEO CLIP from ED. TITLED "KID COMEBACK and SUPER SQUID!"
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Wow. Okay. I gotta go. Sorry. Call you later.
AMY	Now?
JANE	I have dinner on--
CHARLIE	I gotta go. I'll eat later.
JANE	Charlie! But Charlie's already off and running.
ED	Where the hell have you been?
CHARLIE	You said after school, chill out! Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door.
ED	Right after! It's dusk, dude, you know what that means!?
CHARLIE	That the sun's gone down. What's
THE BIG--	Over him, Ed knocks loudly. Rings the bell.
ED	Hey! Anybody home? A long pause. Nothing.
CHARLIE	Not here. Let's go-- But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle.
CHARLIE	This is nuts. It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.
ED	Hello? Ed and Charlie here! Come on. Charlie follows him in. Resigned and placating.
CHARLIE	Okay. Fine. Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY
ED	Take this. Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous.
CHARLIE	You've got to be kidding me. Ed stops. This is it.
ED	I hate to tell you this but that guy, your neighbor. He's a vampire. One of the undead.
CHARLIE	My neighbor. Next door.
ED	Yeah.
CHARLIE	I just met him. Jerry.
ED	Jerry. A beat.
CHARLIE	That's a terrible vampire name. "Jerry." Seriously--
ED	I didn't name him, man, I'm just reporting the facts! Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's
CHARLIE	Come on, this is a gag -- right? Ed's barely listening -- cautious. Every shadow is potential
ED	Hey! Anybody here? They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's
ED (CONT'D)	Get back, demon! Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open, A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.
ED (CONT'D)	Ha! I killed that sucker dead! They're not here, okay? They left town. His dad was a deadbeat-- Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and
ED	No, see, it's not just them. It started -- there was this thing on Channel 13, a lady escaped an attacker who tried to bite her. Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose
ED (CONT'D)	Adam and me, we graphed the attack, the disappearances. Whole families, gone. And that's you guys at the center, see? His windows are totally
CHARLIE	There's a ton of houses like that. People work nights on the strip--
ED	But every window? No. I've been watching him. It all fits--
CHARLIE	That Jerry's a Dracula.
ED	No. Dracula is a specific vampire.
CHARLIE	I know what you're saying! I'm mocking you. You've been reading too much Twilight--
ED	Fiction, okay? This is real. A real monster. And he's not brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble. He's the fucking shark from JAWS. He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't move on until everyone around him is dead. And that book SUCKS. Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real.
ED	What about your neighbors, the Perrys? He moved into their house. Haven't seen them around, have you?
CHARLIE	Yeah, in San Diego like a month ago!
ED	Exception, proves the rule. You haven't asked him in, have you? He can't get in without an invitation.
CHARLIE	No, but--
ED	Your mom? Lonely divorcee...
CHARLIE	You're on drugs.
ED	No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd take my word, but I have evidence at home. Hard evidence. Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it.
CHARLIE	Yeah. Okay. We have to stake him in his nest. You and me. Not now, it's dark.
CHARLIE	Right. Cause he's nocturnal.
ED	Just for -- okay -- for a minute pretend you're not a douche now--
CHARLIE	Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun when we were eight-- Whatever! I grew up, okay? You don't want to, fine. But don't get an attitude because I'd rather have a life than make shit up! Ed stops. Stung.
ED	Right. Got it. You're soooo cool "Brewster." Go ahead, join the Clark High early-peakers. This is the pinnacle for them. And that includes your girl--
CHARLIE	Shut up.
ED	Undeniably doable, but we used to make fun of her and her pals, remember? They're bimbos--
CHARLIE	Shut up! Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.
ED	Adam's gone -- you act like it has nothing to do with you. We were inseparable, man.
CHARLIE	Yeah. And you know when I got popular? The minute I stopped hanging out with you. Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go. Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps
MARK	You crossed my yard. Tracked your nerdjuice all over it.
ED	Sorry. Sorry--
MARK	My mom works hard on that shit, Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything... else
ED	Can you just hit me? I don't have time for the build up. Go.
MARK	Seriously?
ED	Jesus, man! Just do it! Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow. Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS
ED (CONT'D)	Crap. Crap! There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark approaching in the dark. He drops into a neighbor's backyard.
ED (CONT'D)	Get away! I'm armed mother fucker! Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled. More like a man
MARK	Unbelievable. A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.
ED	Hey! Let me in! Please! But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing
ED	Forget it sucker! No invite! BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls
JERRY	Abandoned. I thought you did your homework.
ED	-- what?
JERRY	You've been watching me. I've been watching you. Seems fair. Ed BOLTS into the house. JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat. Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing. Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.
JERRY	Bit off more than you can chew. Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.
ED	We'll see, man. I know my shit. But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with
JERRY	Really? Who's going to believe you? You see the truth, but what good is it when you're alone? Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.
ED	Don't play that stuff. That mind crap. Come on -- try me. Try me!
JERRY	You say you're glad you're different. But how can you be in a place like this? These people... Even your best friend. You're nothing to him now. Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a
ED	Get back!
JERRY	It can be over. I can make all that pain go away. Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone.
ED	No...
JERRY	You were born for this and you know it. Your "life", what you had? That's the illusion. I can take you somewhere great. Somewhere you'll belong. Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it...hope?
JERRY (CONT'D)	It's a gift. And Jerry moves closer, blocking our view.
JANE	Good on his word. A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in.
AMY	Morning. Charlie?
JANE	You try. My voice seems to be on some frequency he can't hear.
CHARLIE (O.S.)	Coming! Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the
AMY	Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You should facebook him.
JANE	Temptress. I'm resolved. Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated.
AMY	Oversleep?
CHARLIE	Didn't. Weird dreams. Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.
AMY	What? Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's
CHARLIE	Nothing. That guy was such a tool. Totally. Poser. She gets in the car. Smiles a little.
TEACHER	Sally Cabella?
SALLY	Here.
TEACHER	Ed Lee? Nothing. Charlie looks up.
TEACHER (CONT'D)	Edward Lee? Charlie looks around. No Ed. And just like he said -- quite
ABOVE CHARLIE	SEATS ALL AROUND HIM ARE EMPTY. This time it makes an
MARK	.she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude. Like -- one zip and POP!
CHARLIE	Huh.
MARK	What's up with you? Dreaming about your little boyfriend? Charlie takes this in, worried.
CHARLIE	You see him around today? Ed?
BEN	I don't track "it's" whereabouts. What did he want, anyway?
CHARLIE	Nothing. Homework stuff. But Charlie's clearly distracted.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Look, I have to go.
MARK	Now? You're ditching? I'll bail with you.
CHARLIE	No -- I'm -- I don't feel so well. He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed.
VICTORIA	Charlie!
CHARLIE	Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee. Victoria breaks into a wide smile.
VICTORIA	God you're a sight for sore eyes.
VICTORIA	Rick! Charlie's here! Look at you. So handsome!
CHARLIE	Oh, I -- you don't have to-- Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand.
RICK	Ed said you'd sprouted. And you're, the-- Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.
CHARLIE	Cleared up. Yes sir--
VICTORIA	Ed will be so sorry he missed you, But -- you should both be in school now, shouldn't you?
CHARLIE	He's not here? Did you see him today?
RICK	He's usually up and out early. Everything okay?
CHARLIE	No, sure. We're working on a class project. I guess we crossed paths.
VICTORIA	I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed, he'd be mad that I said so, but he talks about you all the time. This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.
CHARLIE	Yeah. That's... He's great. Would it be okay if I went upstairs? Ed has a book we need.
VICTORIA	Of course. Make yourself at home. Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick -- There's an art table where Ed has been working on some He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few
CLOSE ON A PHOTO	Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter
ON CHARLIE	Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees-- Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head.
CHARLIE	This is crazy. He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on -- He opens one. Stops. As BLURRY short clips play: Jerry's truck, in motion but it looks like NOBODY'S DRIVING DORIS the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody.
OFF CHARLIE	Taking this in. Chilled. BAM -- he walks right into JERRY.
JERRY	Hey guy. Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed
CHARLIE	Hey. Guy.
JERRY	You could really do me a solid.
CHARLIE	Yeah? What kind.
JERRY	I have a girl on her way over for a beer, and I'm totally out of beer. They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the
CHARLIE	Bummer.
JERRY	Set me up, I'll pay you back two times. A sixer for your mom, and one for you.
CHARLIE	Uh, yeah, sure. Jerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Let me see what Mom's got. She's kind of a "light domestic".. .mom.
JERRY	Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as my place, huh? Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his
CHARLIE	Fuck!
JERRY	Can I help you with that?
CHARLIE	No! No. Thanks. I'll get it. Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	There you go. Uh...party down. Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and
JERRY	This girl tonight -- she's a handful. You know.
JERRY (CONT'D)	Women who look a certain way, they need to be managed.
CHARLIE	Yeah.
JERRY	You don't mind my saying, you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid. Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must be a line of guys dying to pluck that. Your mom too -- you don't see it, maybe you do -- she's giving it off. It's on you to watch out for them. You up for that? Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.
CHARLIE	I think I can manage.
JERRY	Good. Cause there are bad people out there, man. Better keep an eye on your women. Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.
JERRY (CONT'D)	Thanks for the beers. Charlie watches him move into the dark. His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.
AMY	Where've you been? You told me to meet you here an hour ago.
CHARLIE'S POV	Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on Hello? Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His
CHARLIE	Sorry. You okay? Everything okay? He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.
AMY	Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?
CHARLIE	No, it should. Nothing.
AMY	You ever read this? It's good. Sexy, actually. Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.
AMY (CONT'D)	In a frustrated, unconsummated sort of way.
CHARLIE	Like us, you mean. Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.
AMY	Kinda makes it hotter.
CHARLIE	Yeah, so you keep saying. He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.
AMY	Am I boring you? What's up?
CHARLIE	What? No. I'm kind of wiped out, that's all.
AMY	I can fix that. She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in
AMY (CONT'D)	Want to get under the covers?
CHARLIE	-- now? Seriously?
AMY	Calm down. Let's just... see how it goes. Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.
CHARLIE	Believeme when I say--thereis nothing in the worldI'dratherdo
AMY	Charlie. Don't be nervous. She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie
CHARLIE	You hear that? He rushes to the window. Looks outside.
CHARLIE'S POV	DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Shit.
AMY	What? JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's
CHARLIE	Shit, shit, shit-- Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.
AMY	He's hot. She's a stripper. They were bound to find each other.
AMY	Take away two tiny pieces of cloth, stripper. You jealous?
CHARLIE	What? No-- Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling He looked right at us.
AMY	Maybe. Not a big deal-- Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.
CHARLIE	No, it is a big. A very big. He saw us and he was pissed.
AMY	Okay... Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.
AMY (CONT'D)	If you're not into this, say so. Don't do me any favors.
CHARLIE	What? No! I am, I totally am. just -- I don't trust that guy. He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used
AMY	I'm going.
CHARLIE	Amy. Don't--
AMY	No. You've got your neighborhood watch thing.
CHARLIE	Come on, don't be that way-- But she's gone.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Crap! A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But But are they screams of pleasure or pain? ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. "How to pick a lock." Charlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Crap. He walks away from the door, frustrated. Then turns and Then something occurs to Charlie. He goes into the garden.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	The Perrys... Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK. Turns it over. It has a KEY in He puts the key in the back door lock. It opens. At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway. There's no time to get out so Charlie ducks into the CLOSET. The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room

CHARLIE	Fuck! -- DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks
DORIS	Help...
CHARLIE	Oh my God. Oh, shit-- Charlie tugs on the door. Locked. He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The
DORIS	Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here! Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.
CHARLIE	I'm -- I won't leave you-- But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.
DORIS	Please! No! Don't go! Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris, JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.
DORIS (CONT'D)	.no... . God, no... please... The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her. Please, please... don't kill me. Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement. Cha... Cha... CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny
CHARLIE	Please... Please... The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies

CHARLIE	Same floor plan. He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.
DORIS	Thank you, thank you... Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins
CHARLIE	Doris? In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop
CHARLIE REACTS	Horrified. In shock. The back door is closed now -- but the blinds sway slightly. Jerry takes this in, coldly furious. Jane comes to the door, her knock cursory. She enters.
JANE	You're going to be late. Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie
JANE (CONT'D)	The hours you keep. It's like living with a vampire. Charlie stops. Looks at her. She has no idea.
CHARLIE	Listen -- promise me -- that guy next door, Jerry? Under no circumstances do you invite him into our house. He's dangerous.
JANE	I think I can handle myself.
CHARLIE	No, no you can't--
JANE CHARLIE	Charlie-- Don't even look in his direction, understand? And at night, you stay inside.
JANE	Because he's dangerous. What kind of dangerous? Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt.
CHARLIE	Can you trust me? For once, don't ask a million questions--
JANE	Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not some ridiculous woman-- I'm sorry. Okay? I know... We just don't have time for a big thing! I'm telling you--
JANE	That's enough. I'm done with this conversation. She moves away.
CHARLIE	Mom! Mom-- But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried. As various pages pop up--

CHARLIE	Thanks.

BEN	One less tweaker clogging up the halls. Charlie stands, upset.
CHARLIE	Shut up.
MARK BEN	Charlie-- Chill out- You don't know what you're talking about. He could be dead for all you know. Mark steps in. Calming, reasonable.
MARK	You're right. Not cool. You're worried and it's totally understandable. But he's better off, man. He'll be happier with the other trolls on the shire. That's it. Charlie DECKS MARK. They go to the ground and Mark is bloodied and freaked.
MARK (CONT'D)	What the fuck man!? AMY stands back, appalled.
AMY	Charlie!! What the hell is wrong with you?! You're an idiot, you know that? And it's HOBBITS on the shire! Charlie turns to Amy-- Come on. But she shakes her head and moves to MARK and BEN.

SEXY ASSISTANT	You almost tore my extensions out! Why do you have to throw a real knife!? It barely cuts! That board is like butter. He tears the MAKEUP appliance off his hand that made it look
SEXY ASSISTANT	Everybody else fakes it!
PETER	But this looks authentic--
SEXY ASSISTANT	Then learn how to throw! She stomps off the stage. Peter can't believe it.
PETER	Screw this. He starts to stalk off stage. CHARLIE rushes toward him.
CHARLIE	Mr. Vincent! Mr. Vincent-- A tech guy moves in on Charlie.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Charles Brewster. From the Sun? We had an appointment.
PETER	I don't think so. Talk to my guy.
CHARLIE	We're doing a piece -- "Vampires. Separating myth from fact."
PETER	You want a comment? That's a shit idea for an article. Peter starts to move off. Charlie, anxious, follows.
CHARLIE	Please. I really -- I need your expertise. You're the man on this stuff, right? Peter sees how desperate Charlie is. Stops.
PETER	What is this, like your first assignment?
CHARLIE	Actually -- yeah.
PETER	Ten minutes. Still, goth influence reigns. The decor is tacky Haunted Charlie is shown into the "museum" by Peter's ASSISTANT,

CHARLIE	Yeah. I guess... So -- say I want to kill one. But really. How how would you do it?
PETER	Depends. You got fire, beheading. Or go classic -- stake through the heart. Bam!
CHARLIE	So all that actually works?
PETER	How the fuck do I know.
CHARLIE	I thought you're--
PETER	I read books, man. You think I'm hanging out with Dracula and the Easter Bunny?
CHARLIE	Sorry. No. Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I -- I have a personal interest in this story. A friend's missing, actually. I think one of them got him.
PETER	Them, meaning a "vampire."
CHARLIE	Jerry. He lives next door to me.
PETER	"Jerry?"
CHARLIE	I know. But it's no joke. If you look at these clips, you'll see. They take some time to load but... Charlie moves to Peter, shows him his phone. Digs into his
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	And I printed up some photos I took. In his place. Or lair... Charlie put the photos in front of Peter on the table.
PETER	Arthur!
CHARLIE	No, come on, I'm--

CHARLIE	Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him kill a girl. She burned up in my hands. You have to tell me how to stop him. Arthur enters.
PETER	Get this loser out of my sight.
CHARLIE	I know what I saw.
PETER	No you don't. See this guy? He gestures to ARTHUR.
PETER (CONT'D)	My cousin, Art. He's "me" on stage. That's how I teleport. People see what they want to see. This is what you've been looking for, I promise. I can take you to him, to his place.
PETER	In Clark County Nevada. A hot bed of supernatural activity.
CHARLIE	Yes! It's genius. A transient population. A town where people work all night, sleep all day...
PETER	A town full of con-artists. No. You're working me, or somebody's working you. Charlie's getting angry now.
CHARLIE	He already got my friend! I know how I sound. But I'm not crazy. I didn't want this. I don't want to know this. Just tell me what to do! Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks
PETER	Run.

PETER	You heard me. He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to
CHARLIE	So I save my own skin so he can keep killing!? I won't. We have to kill him! Please!-- Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him. His gaze falls on JERRY'S HOUSE and we follow it. Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's
CHARLIE	What? Jane walks in. Takes in the decor.
JANE	The whole house looks like that show Dark Shadows.
CHARLIE	It's a gag. For Amy. Long story.
JANE	You like her a lot, don't you? A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods.
JANE (CONT'D)	Don't use tape on the walls. Oh. Ed's parents left a few messages, looking for him. Charlie looks up at this. Pained.
CHARLIE	Okay. He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then THE DOORBELL RINGS. Before Jane can really react, Charlie
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	DON'T. Don't open it.
CHARLIE	How'd you get in?!
AMY	It was unlocked.
CHARLIE	MOM! You have to lock the door!
AMY	Okay, whatever, listen. You're flipping out. Punching out your friends and blowing everything off and is that a stake? A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his
CHARLIE	No. Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room
AMY	Look. Even if you're losing it -- you don't get to blow me off. You don't go from something to nothing overnight. You're not nothing to me, Charlie. Whatever's happening, just -- talk to me. Charlie takes this in, emotional. But--
CHARLIE	I can't let you get hurt. You need to forget about me for a while.
AMY	What? How am I going to get hurt? Tell me. Charlie-- Now there's another KNOCK at the door. Jane comes downstairs-
JANE	I got it--
CHARLIE	NO. Don't answer it. A tense moment. Another knock.
JANE	This is ridiculous--
JERRY	Jane. It's Jerry from next door--
CHARLIE	I'm telling you, don't answer it!
JANE	This is my house. I'll answer the door if I want to. She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her
CHARLIE	Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And I have proof. Jane is stunned, at a loss. From the other side of the door--
JERRY (O.S.)	Jane? I need to talk to you.
JANE	Just-- Hold on! Now. Your son is harassing me! He pounds on the door. Jane examines Charlie closely.
JANE	Charlie. What's happening?
CHARLIE	Whatever he says, don't--
JERRY (O.S.)	He broke into my house. I'd rather not take this to the authorities. But I will! He's sick, deluded--
CHARLIE	Mom. A tense beat... Finally-- Get the authorities! My son is a good kid! Charlie sags with relief. A brief look of appreciation
ON JERRY	As he backs away from the door. His expression goes cold.
CHARLIE	Shit, shit...
JANE	What? What is he doing?
CHARLIE	Whatever it is, it's not good.
CHARLIE	Just -- if we stay in here -- he has to give up. He can't get in without an invitation. Oh... Really? Like a--
CHARLIE	Vampire. Really. Amy and Jane are blown away. Charlie's going crazy.
JANE	Think about what you're saying--
CHARLIE	I have. I've "processed," believe me. Jane takes this in. Then SMILES.
JANE	Ooooh. This is the gag! For Amy. I can't believe you got Jerry to go along with it! Charlie stops. Fuck.
CLOSE ON JERRY	As he starts to DIG UNDERGROUND -- amazingly strong and
CHARLIE	Take these. Put them on. Just do it. Okaaaay. Vampire protection!
AMY	I don't think this is funny. But she puts it on. BOOM!! The GAS FIREPLACE EXPLODES, the STOVE EXPLODES, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT as Charlie JUMPS on Jane and Amy, dragging The room starts to BURN. Charlie, Amy and Jane are in a panic. They try to put the Charlie stops. A CHILLING SIGHT: Jerry stands on the other side of the blown-out windows. His
JERRY	Don't need an invitation if there's no house. A beat. Charlie GRABS Amy and Jane and they RUN through the
AMY	I can drive--
JANE	I drive! They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener--
CHARLIE	Gun it Mom! Go!!! Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it. Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into
ON JERRY	As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on. What did we do!? What does he want!? They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING Everyone reacts. Then the BIKE STARTS - the wheels spinning

AMY	My brother has a gun!
CHARLIE	Good to know! Is he here?!
JANE	Call the police! Anybody-- Jane manages to evade Jerry until -- The TRUCK SKIDS in a long arc in front of them and BLOCKS
JANE (CONT'D)	Oh hell. In a flash, Jerry is out of the truck and coming for them.
CHARLIE	GO! Go! Don't stop!! Go-- Charlie steps on the accelerator, grabs the wheel and AIMS
JANE	Charlie!! They RUN JERRY OVER WITH A TERRIBLE THUDDDD!!! Amy and Jane
JANE (CONT'D)	Oh my God!! Charlie steps on her accelerator foot, the CAR ZOOMS FORWARD.
AMY	Are you nuts!? You can't kill that guy!
CHARLIE	You have no idea. It's him or us. Mom. MOM. Jane looks at him -- can feel that he's telling the truth.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Where is he? Where'd he go? Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car. Jane and Amy SCREAM! JERRY'S EYE glares through the small hole. It's all BLACK. He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car, The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face. As Jerry drags over the highway, the pavement grinding away He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The A GRIM MOMENT -- only the sound of hissing air and groaning
AMY	Oh... Are you-- Jane? Jane is woozy. Hurt.
CHARLIE	Mom?
JANE	I'm okay... Charlie sees that the other car is drivable. The guy inside,
FAMILY MAN	What the hell do you think you're doing!-- Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent--
CHARLIE	NO! Hey man, stay in your-- But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry,
CAR.	In a flash, Jerry grabs the guy and VAMPS, ripping the family
CLOSE ON MINIVAN	As those "cute" stick figure family decals are splattered Now out of the car, react. JERRY IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE. Charlie looks at Amy and Jane. I told you so.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Yeah. Charlie urgently grabs them. Shoves them down the highway.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Get out of here. Run. Run!
CHARLIE	Go! I'll catch up! She's hurt, get out of here! They back off. Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it
JERRY	Let them run. Just makes them easier to kill when I'm done with you. Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry,
CHARLIE	I repel you with the power of Christ the Lord.
JERRY	Do you? Really? When did you take your last confession?
CHARLIE	Get back...
JERRY	That's a mighty big cross you have there. Question is -- do you actually know how to use it? Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp,
JERRY (CONT'D)	Ever take one of these in the chest? I have. Charlie struggles, terrified.
JERRY (CONT'D)	But they missed the heart. Rigggght... . here. Easy measurement. Jerry positions the "stake" right over Charlie's heart.
JERRY (CONT'D)	Shouldn't have been so nosey. Jerry's about to plunge the STAKE through Charlie's heart
JANE	Leave my kid alone. Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the
CHARLIE	Mom! Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car. Charlie presses the accelerator. Will it still drive?
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Come on come on come on... IT LURCHES forward, then goes. Metal scraping the ground, Jerry writhes in the middle of the road. But even as he
COP #1	So a gas leak caused the fire at your home and...
CHARLIE	My mom didn't feel right, we were trying to get her to the hospital. It was stupid to let her drive.
COP #1	Yeah it was. And driver who rear- ended you, you get the exact make and name of the van?
CHARLIE	It wasn't there when you got there?
COP #2	Hit and run. Happens all the time. Charlie stifles his surprise. Nods.
ANGLE ON AMY	On her cell, pacing as she eyes Charlie with the cops.
AMY	We won't stay up all night. Bee and Cara need help with Trig -- it's not a party. Okay. Okay... Mom? I love you. She stops at the open door of a hospital ROOM. Her gaze
JANE	Who lies motionless in a bed. A doctor checks her chart. Maybe you should have said something to the police.
CHARLIE	Like what? A vampire moved next door, borrowed some beer, ate a stripper and then blew up our house because we wouldn't invite him in? Amy looks at him.
AMY	Okay. The DOCTOR approaches.
DOCTOR	You should get some rest.
CHARLIE	She's going to wake up, right?
DOCTOR	Assuming the swelling is minimal, I hope so.
CHARLIE	But you don't know.
DOCTOR	Not yet. We need to give it time. The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves. The ASSISTANT from the show toddles out on high heels and a
ASSISTANT	Bye babe. Good show tonight. He's barely paying attention.
PETER	You were late again on "The Devil's Torture Chamber." But she's gone. A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he Absently, he sifts through them. Stops. He picks up the one of the INSIGNIA. Peter reacts. Stunned. This means something to him. And a hand-drawn sketch, in a youthful scrawl, of THE
CHARLIE	This is my fault.
AMY	You didn't make any of it happen.
CHARLIE	Ed came to me. I turned my back on him.
AMY	How were you supposed to believe him? None of it makes sense.
CHARLIE	He did talk a lot of demented crap. He was my best friend. He asked me, begged me, to believe him.
AMY	People change. Everybody--
CHARLIE	Yeah they do. I turned into a dick. I figured my dweeb past, not big with the ladies. So you're saying this is my fault.
CHARLIE	I wanted you to like me. I tried to erase Ed -- all of it. I know how that feels.
AMY	I knew you were a dweeb. You think I want a "dude" like Mark or Ben? I like that you're different... It didn't hurt that your skin cleared up. She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then
AMY (CONT'D)	I can't believe we didn't have sex.
AMY	No, seriously. I'm going to die a virgin? Me? How did this happen?
CHARLIE	We're not going to die--
AMY	But what if we do? Let's do it. Now. The bathroom. Charlie. A beat.
CHARLIE	I think we should kill the vampire first. I'll perform much better. They laugh -- trying not to cry. Then:
AMY	Oh my God, Charlie. What are we going to do?
CHARLIE	We're going to fight. Then Charlie's phone rings. He answers.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Hello?
PETER	I can help you. My place. One hour.
AMY	The Peter Vincent?
CHARLIE	Under-whelming, believe me. But he's what we've got. They close Jane's door and we see that it's COVERED in
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	My mom is very religious. A MIDORI cocktail WIDEN to reveal that PETER is pouring himself a whopper. Amy
PETER	I'll tell you what I know, but that's it. Don't expect me to join your Scooby gang.
CHARLIE	Anything. I'll take it.
PETER	I found the origin of that insignia you showed me. It's a species that originated in the Mediterranean. They nest in the earth -- explains that hole you saw. And they kill slowly, keep their victims alive for days. "Snackers."
CHARLIE	So -- they turn all of them? Make their victims into vampires.
AMY	I know. I read.
PETER	No. It takes a while before they complete the change. They usually finish them off before that.
AMY	So how do you kill these guys, this "tribe"?
PETER	Usual stuff. But it's a strong breed. You need a plan-- A VOICE interrupts over an intercom. It's ARTHUR, Peter's Delivery. Guy says you need to sign for something.
PETER	Send him in. I order things when I've had a few cocktails. It's a-- Wait. You get deliveries this late?
PETER	I don't know. Maybe-- Charlie stands.
CHARLIE	No. You said he could come in. The delivery guy. That's--
AMY	What? Charlie--
VOICE (O.S.)	An invitation, airhead. They turn and see EVIL ED, in one of Jerry's "uniforms."
ED	Looking at them now. Yes sir. He's modern, Jerry, dispensed with all that "master" stuff. Hey bud. Charlie steps in front of Amy.
CHARLIE	You've got a problem, keep it with me.
ED	Problem? You let him get me, man. Ed is CREEPING TOWARD Charlie.
ED	You let him turn me into this. At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth. SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy
PETER	Stay away, demon.
ED	"Stay awaaaay, demon!" Ed closes in on Peter. Peter looks to Charlie. It's real. Whatcha got there? Itsy bitsy little stakey?
PETER	Crucifixion nail. Lethal to you.
ED	Old school. Nice. Got to get pretty close to use it, though. Peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand. Fuck.
ED (CONT'D)	Uh uh. No you don't. ED BOLTS AFTER PETER. Charlie and Amy race the other way.
CHARLIE	The elevator! The POWERFUL DOOR CLOSES ON ED'S ARM, crushes it. ED HOWLS
ED	A panic room!? You better panic, loser! You better watch your neck! Prince of darkness is a little baby man! I love it! All the fat chicks in your fan club are gonna be so bummed! He hears ED flipping out, but ED DOESN'T SHOW UP ON THE
AMY	Oh my God, oh my God... Amy's starting to lose it. Charlie grabs her.
CHARLIE	Look at me. Stop. There's another way out of here. And there are a million things to fight with in here. Understand? We're going to make it. Amy pulls herself together. Nods. They RUN.
INNERCUT WITH ED	Tracking them -- not far behind, his stub of an arm bleeding
ED	Give it up, Chuck! You're dead. If you hadn't ended up such a dick, I might have tricked you out. We could have rocked this evil shit! But you blew it. Nothing but the big dirt nap for you and your lady.
AMY AND CHARLIE	Round a corner -- it's a dead-end. They see a large antique
ON ED	As he comes around the same corner a moment later. AMY and He's pale and weakened -- and still has lots of cuts and He's also changed into new clothes, jeans and a SWEATER.
GUARD	Sign in, please.
JERRY	I know where I'm going.
GUARD	Sign in. No exceptions. Jerry ignores him, keeps moving toward the elevator.
GUARD (CONT'D)	Hey! I'm talking to you. Sign in, or you're not going nowhere. Jerry turns. Slow and deliberate. Expression cold.
ED	I expected more of a fight. Girl's made you lazy in the head. Pussy'll do that. ED YANKS the curtain on the confessional open.
ED (CONT'D)	Look at that. Vincent's got a Vincent.
CLOSE ON	A large cabinet on the other side of the room. AMY AND CHARLIE holds AMY close, muffling her sobs.
ON ED	His face bloodied. Eyes wild. The trembling body of ARTHUR Ed turns Arthur over. Arthur's still breathing, reaches for
ARTHUR	.I have ...kids ...
ED	Had. Ed lifts Arthur off his feet and chokes him with one hand...
ED (CONT'D)	Don't take it personal. I'd eat you -- but I'm saving my appetite. Arthur's turning a horrible purple, eyes bulging... Ed
ED (CONT'D)	Dinner with an old friend. He wipes a small smear of blood from his mouth.
ED	I know you're here. I can hear you breathing. It's totally cool. He laughs, hyper. Excited.
ED (CONT'D)	Sooo, I take out the prom king and queen? Embarrassment of riches! CHARLIE SHOVES the case he hides behind with Amy over ONTO Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on
ED	Mano e...one mano. Piece of cake. Cause I'm a God Damned killing machine, and you're like all the Clark High big shots -- nothing. You picked the wrong side, man. Ed lashes out, slicing CHARLIE on the arm with his SHARP
CHARLIE	I didn't pick--
ED	You didn't think. Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.
CHARLIE	I know. I'm sorry. Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING
ED	Steeeerike! Call that a swing, Slugger? Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him.
ED (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Come on! You're not even trying. Charlie looks back, Ed's HEAD is only HALF OFF. He's Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails. Charlie
AMY	Charlie! She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out
JERRY	You are something, aren't you? Amy spins. Jerry's closing in on her. Beautiful, seductive.
JERRY (CONT'D)	Werewolves. Amy FLINGS holy water in his face. JERRY SCREAMS, burns.
AMY	Vampires. She RUNS.
ED	Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles. Hard to cut. Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of Ed manages to get Charlie in a one-arm embrace of sorts,
ED (CONT'D)	Is this weird for you too? I feel like such a homo-- Charlie FLIPS ED -- they are wrestling when Charlie sees AMY Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden Ed is on the ground. Moaning, laughing. Charlie has his
AMY	Do it. Charlie! Charlie's frozen. Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never.
ED	Wow. Bimbo has some juice--
AMY	Jerry's here. He's coming!
CHARLIE	I'm sorry. WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment --
ED	I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was his Renfield. Funny if you-- Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt. Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room.
AMY	I found the stairs. Come on. She flings the door to the stairwell open and they RACE DOWN It's like Peter's looking at his own mutilated corpse.
AMY	Stop. Stop, I need to--
CHARLIE	Not now. He's coming for us.
AMY	He can't kill us, not here--
CHARLIE	Who's going to notice? Who's going to care? Amy, look around-- Amy takes in the people on the floor. Drunk, oblivious. Two
AMY	Oh, God...
CHARLIE	Keep moving. Come on. Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit
ON JERRY	Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club. It's dizzying, disorienting. Charlie sees JERRY enter, look around for them. The best bet Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
DJ	Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh! The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward...
AMY	Charlie! Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to
CHARLIE	Amy? Amy! Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd,
AMY	who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Amy! Charlie's frantically pushing toward her. But the CRUSH of
CLOSE ON AMY	As a HAND slips into hers. She turns, relieved, to find--
JERRY	Holding her with a firm grip.
AMY	No. No! Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from
AMY (CONT'D)	Help!! A GUY in the crowd high-fives him. All part of another crazy
GUY	Go get her, man! AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she
AMY	Help me! Help!! CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is Charlie grabs his cell -- hits a button. It dials, then-- Peter! We're in the casino, the club! Jerry's got Amy! He's got
AMY	Charlie's coming, he'll find me--
JERRY	I'm counting on it. Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he
JERRY (CONT'D)	Come on. He grips her harder, sways with her to the music. Leans His predatory skills in high gear.
JERRY (CONT'D)	You just need a taste. You'll see. It can be like a dream. Jerry draws a nail over his wrist, draws a line of blood. He That's it... Good girl. JERRY looks up sees CHARLIE coming toward them. CHARLIE'S GETTING CLOSER when--
CHARLIE	Amy! No!-- BAM! A hand falls on his shoulder.
DOORMAN	How'd you get in here?
CHARLIE	You have to help me. That guy, he's going to kill her, he's a The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's
DOORMAN	Yeah? Then she's liking it. Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.
CHARLIE	You don't understand!--
DOORMAN	ID. Then you can tell me your whole sad story--
CHARLIE	No! There's no time-- Amy!! Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the
JERRY	Sees that CHARLIE is restrained. Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs No! NO! As he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY. Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no
CHARLIE (O.S.)	I see you got my message. Peter turns. Sees Charlie standing in the doorway.
PETER	How'd you get in here?
CHARLIE	Security's a little lax. Everybody got their throat ripped out. Peter backs away as Charlie moves in. Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a
PETER	You too? He change you?
CHARLIE	Look at your monitor. PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I don't know if Amy's alive or dead or turned -- but he's got her. My mom may not make it. And Ed... I'm going to end him, or he's going to end me.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	One way or the other, that's how it's going to be and you're going with me.
PETER	Don't you get what this is? There's no fighting. There's only surviving, if you're lucky--
CHARLIE	You call this surviving? If you live and we all die, you think you'll ever be able to get us out of your head?
PETER	I know I won't. I never could -- not after the first time. This stops Charlie.
PETER (CONT'D)	I told myself I probably made it up. I was a kid. Maybe it was easier to believe in monsters...
CHARLIE	Made what up?
PETER	The vampire who killed my parents, my brothers. But not me. I hid. Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense. I didn't collect all this stuff for fun. I thought maybe I could find the tribe, "avenge" my people.
CHARLIE	So do it. We'll go in at dawn. He's got to rest sometime-- It's not like that. When I was a kid, I hid because I wanted to live. I still do! This isn't the comics. You want to be a dead hero. Good for you. But I'm out.
PETER (CONT'D)	You think I'm a coward. I'm just a realist. Moment of hesitation for Charlie. Has he been affected by
CHARLIE	So you bail on people, erase them. I don't want to make it to tomorrow, not if you're the kind of man I have to be. A moment. Peter is full of self-loathing, but resolved.
PETER	Wait. Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from
PETER (CONT'D)	Blessed by Saint Michael. Kill a vampire with it -- it's supposed to turn his victims back. If Amy's changed, you can still save her. If it's for real.
PETER	Who knows what's for real any more. Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--
PETER (CONT'D)	There's no guarantee he'll be asleep during the day. He's housebound, not hibernating.
CHARLIE	I'll figure it out.
PETER	No, you need a plan. To stake him, you have to get close -- he's stronger than you.
CHARLIE	Holy water?
PETER	Slow him down. Won't stop him. Torch him, you'll have a few good minutes before he really goes up. Believe me, a vampire on fire isn't thinking clearly.
CHARLIE	But if he's on fire, how do I get close enough to stake him? A beat.
PETER	Fuck. You just worry about yourself. With that, Charlie leaves. Off PETER. Disgusted with himself. He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Those rooms upstairs, that's probably where he's got Amy. I get her out, assuming she's-- Then I have to get him on the ropes. He thinks... Then looks up, an idea occurring. Jane lies
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I have to go. More energized, Charlie stands and gathers his things.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I'm coming back for you, Mom.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Going to kill a vampire. The guy looks at him. Then--
STORE GUY	Good for you. The store guy waits. Charlie hands over his money. LOOMING, silhouetted against early morning light. Next to Before he enters, Charlie DOUSES HIMSELF IN HOLY WATER.
CHARLIE	Let's do this shit. He swallows hard, scared but determined.
CLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS	Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house. Charlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting
NO AMY	Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns... And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck -- she looks She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional.
AMY (CONT'D)	You shouldn't be here--
CHARLIE	Where is he?
AMY	I don't know. He dumped me here. I'm bait. He said so--
CHARLIE	How do you feel?
AMY	I'll survive. Please get out of here. He's too strong--
CHARLIE	I'm stronger. In a nerd power way. You know... He reaches into his jacket, pulls out a CROSS.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Take this. It should-- He looks up. AMY IS GONE. Disappeared. Charlie, reacts. Calls out in a hushed panic--
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Amy? Amy!? Nothing. It's like she vaporized. He finally finds one door that's unlocked, rushes through -- Jerry's building more cells. Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and BAM!
CHARLIE	Shit! You--
PETER CHARLIE	Sorry-- How'd you-- A beat. Then:
PETER	Guess I don't want to be a man like me either. Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons.
PETER (CONT'D)	Let's kill something. You reek. Midori?
PETER	Don't get greedy. I'm here. And I found something else. From my collection. Powerful shit. From around his back, he reveals A DOUBLE-BARRELLED SHOTGUN
CHARLIE	Wooden bullets? Nice.
PETER	No, you think I'm fucking MacGyver? Bullet, bullets. They'll buy us some time. Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs.
CHARLIE	We have to find Amy. She was in a room upstairs, then she just disappeared. This house--
PETER	What do you mean she "disappeared?"
CHARLIE	She was there. I looked away, looked back -- she was gone. Peter takes this in.
PETER	Show me where.
PETER (CONT'D)	Floor trap. I use it all the time.
CHARLIE	Where does it go?
PETER	Only one way to find out. Peter lowers himself into the hole under the trap door--
CHARLIE	Wait -- you're going in?
PETER	See that? Like a great date. Get me drunk and I'll try anything. Peter lets go and FALLS. Charlie steels himself, goes in
PETER	Ow, crap... They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
ON CHARLIE	As he sees something. Stops. A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave. Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:
CHARLIE	You uncover him. I'll light him up, then stake him. Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Flame retardant. They're standing over the grave now. Both nervous. After a moment Peter UNCOVERS PART OF THE BODY. Then he Charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister. Gas.
PETER	You should be a magician. As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches Stop! No-- CHARLIE stops JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO TOSS the match.
PETER (CONT'D)	Who is that? IT'S ADAM, sleeping in a shallow dirt grave.
CHARLIE	Adam. I know him. Knew him.
PETER	Shh. Don't wake him up, for
CHRIST'S--	Peter stops. He's looking over Charlie's shoulder, In the dirt behind CHARLIE are MORE GRAVES. Eight or ten at
PETER (CONT'D)	You know them too? Charlie reacts, stunned. Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face.
CHARLIE	Ms. Granada. My geometry teacher. She was hard up.
PETER	How about we go back to my "run away" plan? We can't burn Jerry out. There's no way we'll get all these people out if the house goes up.
PETER	I thought you're here for Amy. Great. Right. Save the Geometry-- A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's They creep toward the door.
CLOSE ON CHARLIE	Charlie puts his hand on the doorknob... Turns it...
JERRY	You look bigger on TV. Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM! But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends PETER He cautiously moves to retrieve it... He stops as he sees A FIGURE emerge from the dark. AMY.
CHARLIE	Amy, God... She clings to him, near tears.
AMY	Charlie.
BLAM!	Peter fires again -- grazes JERRY.
JERRY	In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood-
CLOSE ON GRAVES	One by one, the TRIBE of vampires wake. ADAM, MS. GRANADA...
AMY	You should have run with me while we had the chance. You should have saved me, Charlie. Charlie takes this in, pained. Then--
CHARLIE	It's not too late. She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps...
AMY	It is. He's inside me now. Her EYES GO DARK -- fingernails grow SHARP and dig into Charlie shoves her off, hard. But she holds him tight -- and
JERRY	It's over, guy. Charlie -- his girl's having her way with him. She's way out of his league anyway. Peter, trapped, won't be able to keep them at bay much
PETER	Stop! Stop! Desperate, he BLASTS them again. Hits one on the shoulder.
JERRY	And your aim--
PETER	You don't get it! I'm on your side. Peter smiles a little. Shows his rows of SHARP FANGS. Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole. Dives for it.
AMY	You wouldn't.
CHARLIE	Try me. She STRADDLES HIM, sexual and raw. Charlie's repulsed,
AMY	I'll be the best you ever had. The only you had. Charlie. We can be together forever. She leans in, licks his neck seductively... She sits back, the STAKE IN HER CHEST. She falls away, Charlie pulls the stake out -- scrambles out of the nest. A beat. AMY, in terrible pain, LAUGHS. Nothing's happening.
AMY (CONT'D)	Missed. You missed. Charlie BREAKS THE DOOR OPEN with his crowbar.
CHARLIE	I know. He backs away from her. Into-- ON PETER, who's pale and shaking...
CHARLIE	Get off him! He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for
ADAM	Dude!
CHARLIE	Sorry. AMY enters from the other room -- already healing. Jerry
JERRY	I'll finish this. Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie.
PETER	Worth a shot. "Master of illusion." Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He You think that's going to stop me? Time to man up. Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling. Now. I'm going to kill your girl -- make you watch. I'll take my time with you. And once you're dead, I'll finish your mother. Too bad about that one. She sucked me dry. Like a pro. Amy smiles a little. Jerry GRABS CHARLIE, lifts him off his Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER -- Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN. PETER has the gun again -- has managed to pull himself up He BLOWS away ONE OF THE SUPPORT BEAMS. BLAM! And ANOTHER. BLAM! And ANOTHER. BLAM -- he misses.
PETER	Fuck. Charlie DIVES for SAFETY as the CEILING COLLAPSES in part of Fuck yeah! Nice sweater, loser! Another BEAM collapses. BURYING JERRY, AMY and the others A stunned beat. Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort. Charlie looks at him -- amazed. I'm better with stationary targets.
CHARLIE	Yeah you are. Peter looks at him, sad.
PETER	Get out of here. We don't have much time before they dig out. I can save you. I have to kill him with this.
PETER	You're a brave mother, I get it. And you were right. This is how I had to go... But we didn't count on an army.
CHARLIE	He'll kill you both, he said--
PETER	We're already dead. Go now, you live to fight another day. Stay -- there won't be one. Charlie stops. Swayed. Pained. Do it.
CLOSE ON CHARLIE	Accepting it. It's what he has to do. He starts DIGGING.
PETER (CONT'D)	Charlie! But Charlie ignores him, determined. Pulls his MASK DOWN Stop! WHAM! JERRY BURSTS OUT OF THE RUBBLE, attacks Charlie. Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES now
PETER (CONT'D)	Charlie! Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help. Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle. A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it
JERRY	Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in
JERRY	Blow me. Thinking fast, PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in
ON AMY	Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the
ABOVE THE OPEN GRAVE	Peter pulls Charlie's mask back. Charlie is burned,
AMY	Charlie! She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.
AMY (CONT'D)	Charlie... Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally,
CHARLIE	Blow me? Seriously? Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Those are his last words? What a tool. We pull away, leaving this tableau... UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe
MS. GRANADA	Let's agree to never talk about this. Jane, released from the hospital, looks healthy and glowing.
JANE	Think you'll ever feel the same about a nighttime sky?
PETER	Same as what? I was always terrified.
JANE	Right. We're just catching up.
ON AMY AND CHARLIE	Charlie sees the connection between Peter and Jane.
CHARLIE	I'm not seeing that.
AMY	She deserves some fun. Your mom fully cheated death. You too. You deserve fun.
AMY	Oh, I plan on it. Now that you've killed your first vampire...
CHARLIE	I am so going to perform. Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.
VOICE	"Frak!" "Frak!" What is that? Charlie, a little sheepish, shows her. He's wearing a
CHARLIE	Battlestar.
AMY	Right.
CHARLIE	It was Ed's. Amy smiles a little, softens.
AMY	Right. Frak? PETER is passing. Hears this. Is down with it.
PETER	Frak! Right on. Perfect Woman, can I get you a drink?
AMY	I'll take another. Thanks. I'll give you a hand. Charlie follows PETER into the DINING ROOM, where a BAR CART
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	I thought you were on the wagon.
PETER	It's dark. I'm on the "day" wagon.
CHARLIE	Thanks for inviting us.
PETER	We should celebrate. Being alive. Your mom's clean bill of health.
CHARLIE	You wanted to put the moves on her.
PETER	What? No. What?
CHARLIE	Just -- I'm watching you. I've got to look out for her.
PETER	Yeah you do. So here's what I'm thinking. We faced the beast and we won. Can you imagine the possibilities if we had got that shit on film?
PETER	Show up on film, yeah. But werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get proof, catch something -- we could build a stage act around that, you wouldn't believe. We'd blow those Cirque bitches away!
CHARLIE	An act? Seriously? What about saving people from evil? What
ABOUT--	A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.
PETER	It happens. All this stuff...
CHARLIE	Ever think about collecting something else? Snow globes or--
CHARLIE (CONT'D)	Yeah, definitely get new stuff. Peter leads CHARLIE OUT, back to the ladies in the other
PETER (O.S.)	I'm serious, man. Do you know how much we could make? Think about how much people pay to see a tiger, or boobs, right? What if we had a tiger, boobs -- and a zombie! After they've gone we linger on the window. Is that Ed's You're so coooool Brewster!!
