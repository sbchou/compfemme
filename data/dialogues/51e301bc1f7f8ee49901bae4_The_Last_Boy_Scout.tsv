HALLENBECK	You okay, Sarah...?
SARAH	I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night.
HALLENBECK	Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear? SARAH Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards.
HALLENBECK	She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen. SARAH Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe. HALLENBECK Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at night, I think, 'Christ, a burglar.' I almost shot her twice.
SARAH	You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup.
HALLENBECK	Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny.

SARAH	Excuse me?
HALLENBECK	Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that I'm a detective. See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? So. Why the steamy shower? Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause. silence hangs between them. Sarah just stares. Shakes
SARAH	Well, nothing changes. You're still a lunatic.
HALLENBECK	Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it. What's his name? SARAH Please leave. I have to get dressed. HALLENBECK It's okay, I've seen you naked. So, apparently, has someone else. What's his name?
SARAH	You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...?
HALLENBECK	Is this a trick question? SARAH I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? awkward pause. Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:
HALLENBECK	No. We won't open the door. SARAH Thank you. HALLENBECK Nope. Door stays shut. Instead, what I'm gonna do is... ... I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One.
SARAH	If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun.
HALLENBECK	Two. The truth is a beautiful thing. cocks the hammer. Arm extended, hand rock steady.

HALLENBECK	How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife...? MILLER It just happened, Joe. It just happened. You call me from here this morning?
MILLER	She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna leave a message on the machine. HALLENBECK When you found out I was back. Why didn't you split?
MILLER	She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office. HALLENBECK Normally I wouldn't.
MILLER	You knew?
HALLENBECK	I suspected. So how about it, Mike? On a scale of one to ten. How was she?
MILLER	Joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh?
HALLENBECK	How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly until you put your dick in my wife.
MILLER	You gotta understand -- HALLENBECK I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody. I don't gotta understand anything. speaks then. Head down. Eyes averted.
SARAH	Put the gun down. HALLENBECK Hmmm? Oh, right, the gun. You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. pulls the trigger. SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. it to pieces. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor.
HALLENBECK	Where was Darian? SARAH She stayed at Cindy's last night. nods. Turns and waves the gun at Miller.

HALLENBECK	He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me.

JIMMY	She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers. Right. So what does she do?
JIMMY	I don't know. Follow the guy? Have him followed?
HALLENBECK	Bingo. Kid, this is making sense. She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence. JIMMY Who does she hire? HALLENBECK Ah. She hires my buddy Mike. Right? Right. It makes sense. Except -- JIMMY Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man.
HALLENBECK	Exactly. He got spotted. They made him, and they killed him. Then they took out Cory. JIMMY Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto? HALLENBECK Whatever it was, it was way over their heads. They knew they were in trouble. JIMMY How you figure? HALLENBECK Because Mike was scared. He bailed out and threw the case in my lap. JIMMY He handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was? stares straight ahead. Sighs and says:
HALLENBECK	He was fucking my wife, Jimmy. I die. He gets my wife. that moment, McCaskey pokes his head out of Bessalo's

JIMMY	Shit. This shirt cost me eighty bucks. HALLENBECK Glad to see, at a time like this, at least you got your priorities straight. JIMMY Do me a favor and shut up. You think I don't care that Cory's dead? Christ, I feel like I been rode hard and put away wet. HALLENBECK Get some sleep. JIMMY Wow. What stunning advice. I was gonna go hiking. HALLENBECK Fuck you. start down the hallway, side by side.
JIMMY	You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks. HALLENBECK How's this? Fuck you and the horse that looks like you.
JIMMY	Get some sleep. passing PATROLMAN stops. Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully. PATROLMAN You look real familiar. Do I know you? grins, shrugs. Obviously flattered.
JIMMY	You might. Some people recognize me.
PATROLMAN	Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to sell hash in Crenshaw District. JIMMY No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions. PATROLMAN What position? JIMMY Forget it. PATROLMAN Fuckin' football. Free agents ruined the damn game. walks away. Jimmy scowls. Grumbles to himself.
HALLENBECK	We gotta cross the parking lot. You wanna borrow my sunglasses? JIMMY Fuck you.
HALLENBECK	Hey, snappy comeback. You a detective? the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, is a heated exchange. The pimp slaps her. Hard.
JIMMY	That son of a bitch! ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck from trouble.
HALLENBECK	What the fuck are you trying to do, Tarzan?
JIMMY	He hit the chick. HALLENBECK You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons?
JIMMY	Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay? HALLENBECK Why? Because they're weak and need protecting? JIMMY Yeah. serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his
JIMMY	Mind if I catch a ride with you? HALLENBECK Yes. My car's fucked up, remember? HALLENBECK Take the bus. JIMMY Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life. Let me buy you a beer. HALLENBECK I'm not thirsty. Good night. approaches his battered Plymouth. Jimmy scowls.
JIMMY	That's it. Good night? HALLENBECK Go home. Get some sleep. JIMMY What are you gonna do?
HALLENBECK	I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend. JIMMY What's the message?
HALLENBECK	That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us.
JIMMY	You're kidding. gets in the car. Says nothing. JIMMY You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything?
HALLENBECK	The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it's over. My job is done. JIMMY Fuck you your job is done. We witnessed a murder, Joe! HALLENBECK Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo. You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts.
JIMMY	Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you.
HALLENBECK	The hell you are. JIMMY I'm part of this. We do something, we do it together. HALLENBECK Have a ncie night. STARTS the CAR. JIMMY Don't drive away, Joe. puts it in gear. Pulls away. JIMMY Joe -- ! I'll tell the cops, Joe. taps the brake. Stops. Leans out the window, says HALLENBECK Tell them what, Jimmy? JIMMY That Mike Miller was fucking your wife. Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death. When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I'm scared, and I'm coming with you, got it? gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy.
HALLENBECK	You little creep, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you. JIMMY Go for it. Then the cops'll really love my story. You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. HALLENBECK You and me is not a fight. You and me is a massacre. JIMMY Gosh, you're tough.
HALLENBECK	Get in the fucking car. is in a foul mood. Jimmy lights a cigarette JIMMY You got any hobbies? HALLENBECK Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist.
JIMMY	Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are the hardest. HALLENBECK Yeah, well, actually -- JIMMY Hey, you got any tapes in here? Man, what is this shit? Dick Haymes. Who the fuck is Dick Haymes? Jeez, you must be older than I thought. grimaces and shifts in his seat. JIMMY What's the matter? Stomach problems? HALLENBECK Ear problems. JIMMY What kind of ear problems? HALLENBECK The kind that won't shut up. stops at a traffic light. Sees a torn poster on a
JIMMY	Baynard, huh? What's the matter, you got some kind of beef with the guy?
HALLENBECK	You might say that.
JIMMY	You wanna share with the class? HALLENBECK Bastard got me fired from my old job. JIMMY Yeah? What were you, cop or something? HALLENBECK Secret Service. JIMMY You're high. Get outta here. Really...? You protected the man? Holy shit, you musta got laid every night. HALLENBECK That's me. Every night. Where did Cory live? JIMMY She had an apartment on the West Side. Why? HALLENBECK I want to check it out. stares at him, puzzled. JIMMY I thought you were off the case.
HALLENBECK	Look, dipshit, I told you that to keep you out of my hair. My client's dead and I haven't earned my fee. JIMMY Whoa, back up. You mean, we're gonna nail these fuckers after all...? Damn. I knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior.
HALLENBECK	Yeah, I'm a prince. Shut the fuck up. and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk HALLENBECK Bet these places run a fortune. JIMMY Tell me about it. I'm paying the fucking rent. HALLENBECK How charming. Sounds like a great girl. What else did you spring for? Clothes? Car payments?
JIMMY	Wasn't like that. Cory could've had lots of rich guys. Me, she loved.
HALLENBECK	Oh. Love. Well, forget about it, then. Let me guess. You don't believe in love. HALLENBECK I believe in cancer. I believe in love.
JIMMY	What, they're both diseases?
HALLENBECK	Something like that. shakes his head sadly. JIMMY Man, I don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up.
HALLENBECK	I'm sure she'd love meeting you. Probably blow you on the front porch. JIMMY Little bitter, Joe? HALLENBECK Eat shit. two men approach the door. Jimmy takes out his key HALLENBECK The cops are gonna want to check this place out, so don't disturb anything. JIMMY Yes, massah. opens the door. Flips on the lights. Stops in room has been systematically torn to pieces. JIMMY I think someone disturbed some stuff, Joe.

JIMMY	What are you doing? brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
HALLENBECK	Gotta disconnect the fucker. JIMMY Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something?
HALLENBECK	Relax, Junior, I used to do this for a living. isolates one wire. Turns and offers the cutters to HALLENBECK You wanna do it? JIMMY No, man, I -- HALLENBECK Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire. hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath
HALLENBECK	Oh, shit not that one! screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass.
JIMMY	You're a fucking asshole!
HALLENBECK	And then some, Junior. And then some.
HALLENBECK	We'll hand this over to the cops. They can analyze it. JIMMY Great. So what now?
HALLENBECK	You tell me, kid. JIMMY Give up? Flee? Go really far away? HALLENBECK I got a better idea. Let's check in with my family. start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth. HALLENBECK I'm tired. You drive.

HALLENBECK	Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure. JIMMY I like Prince.

HALLENBECK	Easy... Jim... All they want is the evidence... TALL MAN The evidence. Very smart. See, Jake, he knows when a situation is untenable. You like that word?
HALLENBECK	Great word. TALL MAN It occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question. HALLENBECK Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses.
JIMMY	Leave him alone, you fuck! HALLENBECK Back off, Jimmy. Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy. TALL MAN Leave him alone...? Whatever you say. Jake? Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck.

HALLENBECK	You're wrong. JIMMY Life doesn't suck?
HALLENBECK	No, life sucks. But you're not a loser. Cory loved you.
JIMMY	Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her. Why do people cheat, Joe?
HALLENBECK	Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior. JIMMY Ooooooh. Very deep. HALLENBECK So deep I don't know what the fuck it means.
JIMMY	It means another drink is required. raises the bottle.
JIMMY	Alex the accountant. drinks. Hallenbeck frowns, watching him.
HALLENBECK	Is Alex your accountant? JIMMY No. But he could have been. Alex was my son. stares at him. JIMMY I was married at 19. Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. I didn't know she was a junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications. She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell asleep. Died before he woke up. He was born... He had time for one dream... and then he died. I wonder what his dream was about.
HALLENBECK	I'm sorry.
JIMMY	I think about him a lot. I mean, who was this... guy? This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe...? What was he like? What would he have been?
HALLENBECK	He would have been a great ball player. Like his dad. JIMMY No. He had to die, Joe. Don't you see?
HALLENBECK	Why did he have to die? JIMMY Because he came out of me. puts aside the bottle. Scowls.

JIMMY	Joe, please! drops the vial in the water. Flushes.
JIMMY	You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit!

JIMMY	Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe. grabs a towel. Scrubs savagely at his wet torso.
JIMMY	And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it! advances on Joe, trembling with anger.
JIMMY	Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing I could do, Joe...! I can't do anything... anymore. JIMMY I couldn't save my wife... She died screaming and I couldn't do a Goddamn thing... And my baby came out... and he was so fuckin' small, Joe... He was too fuckin' small... collapses against the wall. down to a sitting position. Huddled on the floor. a moment, he seems moved to compassion...

PABLO	This is him.
CHET	The kid with the million-dollar arm? PABLO Yeah. Shit. He don't look like much. I wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo. PABLO Neither will anyone else, anymore.
JIMMY	I'm growing whiskers here, guys. You got something to say, fucking say it.
CHET	Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have caught it from his buddy Hallenbeck. JIMMY Who?
PABLO	Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the club. CHET Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business.
PABLO	Get ready, kid. This one's an E ticket. with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms. JIMMY Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! toss Jimmy over the fence.

BESSALO Gimmee the bad news first. McCASKEY Bad news is, they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura. He's busted up.
BESSALO	Okay, now gimme the bad news. McCASKEY I just got a call from Hallenbeck's neighbor. looks up, intrigued. McCaskey continues:
McCASKEY	Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike Miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case, right? Right. McCASKEY Okay. So how come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims that Miller's car was parked there all night, in the same spot? sits bolt upright. Eyes glazed. Wheels turning.
BESSALO	He lied. Why did he lie...? hits him like a thunderbolt. BESSALO Shit. Miller was fucking his wife.
McCASKEY	What? BESSALO That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember? Christ, Joe wasted the bastard himself! stabs a button on the phone. Barks into the receiver:
BESSALO	I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard.
BESSALO	I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike Miller and waltzed right out of my office, I let him go, Goddammit! McCASKEY Relax, Ben. We'll bring him in. He's not that good. BESSALO You wanna bet? with that, we promptly -- HALLENBECK'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE Sallow. Dark circles under the eyes.

PABLO	He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just killed him! looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing.
MILO	Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph, Joseph, you don't disappoint me. draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck.
MILO	You seem to have killed one of my men. HALLENBECK I needed a light. nods as if this makes perfect sense.
MILO	You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have shot you dead.
HALLENBECK	If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me. MILO Yes, that's true. I suppose introductions are in order. HALLENBECK Fuck it. You're the bad guy, right?
MILO	Yes. I'm the bad guy. HALLENBECK And you've got the gun, and I'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that?
MILO	Something like that.
HALLENBECK	Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute. Mind if I have a drink first?
MILO	I don't see why not. Pablo, please take Chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink. a voice rings out from the doorway: Make that two. turns toward the new arrival. HALLENBECK Hey, look who's here. Connie Marcon himself. enough, CONRAD MARCON saunters in, just like he owns MARCON Careful, son. Only my friends call me Connie.
HALLENBECK	You got friends? When did this happen? MARCON I'll give you one thing. You're pretty calm for a man in your position. HALLENBECK You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year.
MARCON	They're having some problems.
HALLENBECK	They stink. composure falters, but only for a moment.
MARCON	I'm glad you're here, Joe. We got a few things to discuss.
MARCON	For starters, I'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better. Used to be, you went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes. Guys who fought for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. Playing only for themselves. Giving nothing back to the game. hands him a double bourbon.
MARCON	This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow? HALLENBECK When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance? looks directly at Hallenbeck.
MARCON	Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight.
HALLENBECK	Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV ratings?
MARCON	People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. reacts, startled. Looks at Milo. MILO We took the liberty of researching your background. MARCON How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype? HALLENBECK I got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir. There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess? begins to dawn on Hallenbeck. HALLENBECK Gambling. MARCON Exactly. Gambling. Just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. And that, Joe boy, is where I come in.
HALLENBECK	Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation --
MARCON	-- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly. HALLENBECK Attendance goes up again. TV ratings go up again.
MARCON	You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy.
HALLENBECK	Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second... why am I still alive? stops pacing. Sighs and sits down facing
MARCON	It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard. HALLENBECK I don't get it. What's the snag? MARCON I offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it. actually does a spit-take. Sprays bourbon.
HALLEBECK	Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies. MARCON Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money.
HALLENBECK	Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million?
MARCON	Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die. HALLENBECK Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you.
MARCON	Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe. HALLENBECK Who is? says nothing. Just looks at Hallenbeck and HALLENBECK Oh, shit. rubs tired eyes.
HALLENBECK	I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard. MARCON Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy. My hands are clean. scowls. HALLENBECK Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme? MARCON Just one. motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway. got Joe's wife.

HALLENBECK	Are you alright, Sarah?
SARAH	Yes. MILO That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut. meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles. back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: shakes his head, exasperated: JIMMY Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now?
BESSALO	Let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason. Is that it? JIMMY That's it.
BESSALO	You're full of shit, kid. Tell me where Hallenbeck is.
JIMMY	How the fuck should I know? Try his house.
BESSALO	We did. Where is he?
JIMMY	For Chrissake, I just met the guy. Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here. glares defiantly at Bessalo. grey day wears on. trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment

It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay. I love you, Joe. HALLENBECK I get the shit beat out of me... puke all over myself... and now you love me?
SARAH	I never stopped loving you, Joe.
HALLENBECK	Christ, you slept with three guys.
SARAH	You knew about the others? HALLENBECK I knew.
SARAH	You never said anything. HALLENBECK Figured... you needed them.
SARAH	Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something?
HALLENBECK	Like what? 'Fuck you, Sarah'?
SARAH	Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that you... that you had some pride left. pause. Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh.
HALLENBECK	Sorry... I'm fresh out.
SARAH	I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of this. HALLENBECK Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of this.'
SARAH	You can take these guys, Joe.
HALLENBECK	I've got cracked ribs and a concussion.
SARAH	Save me, Joe. Be a hero.
HALLENBECK	I don't believe in heroes. SARAH That's no excuse. stares up at her for a moment. Then, through bloody HALLENBECK Fuck you, Sarah... he smiles. PABLO All right, lovebirds, break it up. yanks Sarah to her feet. his gaze roam up and down her body. PABLO Nice tits. rips open her blouse. Roughly fondles her breasts. growls with fury.

MILO	Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price.
HALLENBECK	You're gonna kill us both anyway.

MILO	It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours. MARCON Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty. MILO Very good, sir. MARCON Any problems with Hallenbeck?
MILO	No, we're getting along famously. MARCON Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed. MILO I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise.
MARCON	Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit? MILO If it annoys you, I could always adopt a Texas drawl, though I'm afraid I don't know any stories about fucking pigs. Sir.
MARCON	Cows, Milo. Never pigs.

DARIAN What do you need a boat for? JIMMY I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina. Marcon will be there. swings a bag of gear onto the boat. Starts to store DARIAN Maybe... we should call the police.
JIMMY	No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. I'm sorry, Darian.
DARIAN	So... what do we do...?
JIMMY	What I do... is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back. DARIAN Is that gonna work? JIMMY Beats me, but I think it's what your dad would do. DARIAN I'm scared. JIMMY Me, too, honey. gear stashed, he turns to Darian. Tries a smile.

MILO	What would you do, Joseph, if someone called you that? Would you cut out one of his eyes...?
HALLENBECK	Nope.
MILO	What would you do?
HALLENBECK	I'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone. studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might MILO It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very much like to hear you scream. HALLENBECK Come again?

JIMMY	Thanks, kid. You're a fuckin' inspiration.
MILO	At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea. HALLENBECK Jesus. He thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff. nods. Points to two identical suitcases in the

AND ASSORTED GOONS	in the doorway. All of them have guns. PABLO Face it, pal. You're fucked by God. AND PAPER they're placed in front of Hallenbeck.
PABLO	Are you a literate man, Joe? HALLENBECK I got a subscription to Jugs magazine.
PABLO	That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story.
GOON	We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk. PABLO Get him out of here. Take him to Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as soon as my business here is finished. Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two
PABLO	Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe. About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah... you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself. HALLENBECK Hey, who's writing this story? You're doing all the good parts. PABLO Oh, and, Joe...? Don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered. HALLENBECK What cop? draws his pistol. TWO SHOTS into the unconscious cop in the corner.
PABLO	That one.
HALLENBECK	You son of a bitch...! is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. the fool. regards him with dead, lifeless eyes.
Joe does something very odd.	says, softly:
HALLENBECK	We don't like Pablo very much, do we, Furry Tom...? is a pause... And then, incredibly -- Furry Tom
HALLENBECK	No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass. silence. Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for PABLO Shit, is he doing that? face remains cold. Expressionless.
HALLENBECK	Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm gonna do to him. HALLENBECK You're gong to make Pablo eat all his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck. can't help it. He bursts out laughing. PABLO That's amazing, man! picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes HALLENBECK Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very nice. now, all three hoods are in hysterics.
HALLENBECK	Are you mad, Furry Tom?
HALLENBECK	I don't get mad. I get even. with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens -- of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas. reel across the room.

MARCON	You know I don't enjoy doin' this, Jim. curls up in a fetal ball. Marcon paces, shaking
MARCON	I remember how much you hated the pain... You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you...? I'll make a deal with you. Tell me who you talked to, and I'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow.
JIMMY	Nobody knows. Just... just me... and Hallenbeck... MARCON Now, see, I'd love to believe you. But we are talking about the future of my football team. crosses to the fireplace. Removes a poker.

HALLENBECK Don't. jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly HALLENBECK The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife? MARCON I... I don't remember, I... shoves on the gun. The barrel chokes him.
HALLENBECK	My wife. a pen. Shoves it in Marcon's hand. HALLENBECK The address. Now! MARCON It's... Milo's film studio... HALLENBECK Write it down, dumbfuck. speaks over his shoulder: HALLENBECK Jimmy, you okay...? stirs. JIMMY Hurts like hell. finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the HALLENBECK Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it? Can you walk, Jimmy?
JIMMY	Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...! late. A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head.
STRANGE MAN	Drop it. the same odd voice we heard earlier. man with the speech impediment. HALLENBECK You drop it, asshole, or I kill Marcon.
STRANGE MAN	Sorry, but that won't work. I don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun. pause. Once more, Joe calculates the odds. No dice. STRANGE MAN Walk over there by your friend, Joe. turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops. BAYNARD of the late senator. The right side of his face
HALLENBECK	Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Lou? Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely.
HALLENBECK	Next time, Lou, just say no. JIMMY Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face! meanwhile, is positively livid. He snaps at MARCON You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me! BAYNARD Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad. I never thought I'd see you again, Joe.
HALLENBECK	Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here? BAYNARD Call it a financial partnership. For a price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington.
HALLENBECK	In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times.
BAYNARD	But imagine my delight this morning, Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime... What can I say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist? HALLENBECK Do I also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess?
BAYNARD	It was I, unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne... spoke a little too freely to that hooker. JIMMY She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.
HALLENBECK	He should know, Jimmy. With a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it.
BAYNARD	You can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth. chimes in: JIMMY We'd rather watch yours. It's goofy-lookin'. has had enough. He pounds his fist on the desk.
MARCON	Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em both!
JIMMY	Any bright ideas, Joe?
HALLENBECK	Gimmee a minute.
JIMMY	Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He's trying to think of a way out of this. them, the two hardguys COCK their GUNS. HALLENBECK You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man. holds up his hand. MARCON Wait. gunmen lower their weapons.
MARCON	Let's humor this asshole. What are you talking about?
HALLENBECK	Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in. MARCON You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing.
HALLENBECK	Oh, but I didn't call the cops. I called the mob. stares at him. Blinks.
HALLENBECK	See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. I wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. Of course, I might be able to call it off. stares him down. A pause. Then Marcon smiles: MARCON He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole. Kill them.
HALLENBECK	Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...? once again looks Marcon in the eye.
HALLENBECK	I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it. MARCON Jesus, I don't believe it. This guy's a riot.
JIMMY	I don't think it's working, Joe. Try another one.
HALLENBECK	Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna try one, kid, go for it. pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns --
JIMMY	Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna stand here and die. Mr. Marcon, he's lying. We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I'l hand it over if you let me go. stares in disbelief. kid's actually trying something. MARCON Where is the key, Jimmy?
JIMMY	It's stashed in my shorts. MARCON All right. Slow and easy. JIMMY Sure. Slow and easy. reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls see, but Marcon doesn't: a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.
JIMMY	Promise you'll let me go.
MARCON	Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped. JIMMY Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...? with that, he hurls it into the fire. fast that nobody can see just what he threw.
JIMMY	I guess nobody gets the money. two hardguys rush to the fireplace.
MARCON	Pull it out of there! of them grabs a pair of tongs -- the two hardguys. Cuts them to ribbons. goes for a gun. lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile -- draws down on Jimmy, who picks up a flaming log him backward in a bloody spray. Baynard sags Silence. Jimmy and Joe are alone with three snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle
HALLENBECK	Plastic keys...? The kind that melt?
JIMMY	Hey. Short notice, best I could do. HALLENBECK You did fine, junior. JIMMY Learned it from a pro. Come on. and Joe come racing out of the house, just in time
JIMMY	Son of a bitch! HALLENBECK Forget about him. Let's get my wife. crosses to a parked Mercedes. SHOOTS open the door.
HALLENBECK	Get in. so slick, it's scary. Mercedes barrels out through the splintered garage stare straight ahead. Tense. Breathless.
HALLENBECK	On my way, honey, on my way... Marcon, meanwhile, is rocketing along the winding abandoned in the roadside brush.

HALLENBECK	Maybe. He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town. pause, then Sarah says:
SARAH	I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.' HALLENBECK Don't knock it. It's a skill. turns. Looks into his eyes. SARAH I want to try, Joe. Do you still want to try? pause. He leans in and kisses her tenderly. HALLENBECK Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat. SARAH Shall we invite him in?
HALLENBECK	No. Stay here. I'll deal with it. gets up, throws on a jacket. exits the office, starts across the lawn toward the with a sudden shock: something's wrong.
