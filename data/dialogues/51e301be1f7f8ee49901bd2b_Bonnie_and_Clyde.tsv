BONNIE	Wait there! on, running out the door as she does. The camera with her, moving as fast. As she runs down the she buttons up the dress. the window, in great haste) and continues quickly into driveway. Four feet away from CLYDE, she stops on a They stand there, looking at each other, smiling the challenge. For a few seconds, no one speaks, then:
BONNIE	Ain't you ashamed? Tryin' to steal an old lady's automobile.
CLYDE	I been thinkin' about buyin' me one.
BONNIE	Bull. You ain't got money for dinner, let alone buy no car.
CLYDE	Now I got enough money for cokes, and since it don't look like you're gonna invite me inside--
BONNIE	You'd steal the dining room table if I did.
CLYDE	Come to town with me, then. How'd that be?
BONNIE	Goin' to work anyway. their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading.
CLYDE	Goin' to work, huh? What do you do?
BONNIE	None of your business.
CLYDE	I bet you're a...movie star! No...A lady mechanic?...No...A maid?--
BONNIE	What do you think I am?
CLYDE	A waitress.
BONNIE	to get back now that What line of work are you in? When you're not stealin' cars?
CLYDE	I tell you, I'm lookin' for suitable employment right at the moment.
BONNIE	What did you do before?
CLYDE	I was in State Prison.
BONNIE	State Prison? Yeah.
BONNIE	Guess some little old lady wasn't so nice.
CLYDE	It was armed robbery.
BONNIE	My, my, the things that turn up in the driveway these days. empty street. CLYDE looks the place over. Tracking.
CLYDE	What do y'all do for a good time around here, listen to the grass grow?
BONNIE	Guess you had a lot more fun up at State Prison, huh?
CLYDE	See this foot? I chopped two toes off of it. With an axe.
BONNIE	What? Why?
CLYDE	To get off the damn work detail, that's why. Want to see?
BONNIE	No!... I surely don't intend to stand here and look at your dirty feet in the middle of Main Street. what next to say.
BONNIE	Boy, did you really do that?
CLYDE	Yeah.
BONNIE	You must be crazy. bright sun. They are drinking cokes. As they begin to hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead.
BONNIE	What's it like?
CLYDE	Prison?
BONNIE	No, armed robbery.
CLYDE	It's...I don't know...it isn't like anything.
BONNIE	Hah! I knew you never robbed bo place, you faker.
CLYDE	Oh, yeah? a gun. The camera moves to a closeup of the gun, in the sunlight. touches it in a manner almost sexual, full of repressed
BONNIE	Yeah, well you got one all right, I guess...but you wouldn't have the gumption to use it.
CLYDE	You just keep your eyes open. at what we look at. see what is going on in the store. Then CLYDE comes walking slowly. In one hand he holds the gun, in the a fistful of money. He gets halfway, to BONNIE and broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality. smiles back. The moment is intense, as if a spark has from one to the other. Their relationship, which the minute BONNIE spotted him in the driveway, has now begun. CLYDE has shown his stuff and BONNIE is on."
the old man who runs the grocery store comes	out into the street, completely dumbfounded. He there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in silent CLYDE points the gun above him and fires. It is first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a The old man, terrified, runs back into the store as as he can, CLYDE quickly grabs BONNIE's hand.

A few yards and the stores disappear entirely. landscape turns into that arid, flat and unrelieved plain that begins where the town ends. front, lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make start. As he stands back, BONNIE calls to him:
BONNIE	Hey, what's your name, anyway?
CLYDE	Clyde Barrow. rapid pace.
BONNIE	Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker. Please to meet you. as fast as the car. his hair, running her hands all over him--in short, passionate love to him while he drives. The thrill the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually. what is happening to the driver controlling it. The swerves all over the road. The car comes to a sudden The car starts again. It swerves this time almost off the road before it straightens out. It jumps and Another car comes down the road the other way and car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive off the road into the dirt. It is almost Mack Sennett but not quite that much. as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to to CLYDE. The floor gear-shift is keeping their bodies however. In exasperation, BONNIE takes the gear and shoves it forward out of their way. She plunges CLYDE, burying him from view.
BONNIE	...You ready?...
CLYDE	...Hey, wait...
BONNIE	Aren't you ready? Well, get ready!
BONNIE	C'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's go...let's...
CLYDE	Hey...hey, wait a minute...quit that now, cut it out. I said, cut it out! Suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting. Both and unglued, they stare silently at one another, heavily. CLYDE gets out of the car, clearly Despite the fact that he may have encountered this many times before, it's one that no twenty-one- boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss with bravado. figure out what didn't happen. CLYDE turns back and through the car window from the driver's side, it for her. BONNIE casts CLYDE a fishy stare, then the light.
CLYDE	Look, I don't do that. It's not that I can't-- fingers, and he bangs his head onto roof of --it's just that I don't see no percentage in it.
CLYDE (CONT'D)	I mean there's nothin' wrong with me, I don't like boys. fact, it's both--along with a little latent fascination.
BONNIE	Boy...boy...boy...
CLYDE	Boy, what?
BONNIE	Your advertising is dandy. Folks'd just never guess you don't have a thing to sell. You better take me home, now.
CLYDE	Wait!
BONNIE	Don't touch me!
CLYDE	If all you want's stud service, then get on back to West Dallas and stay there the rest of your life! exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets of BONNIE.
CLYDE	But you're worth more'n that, a lot more, and you know it, and that's why you come along with me. You could find a lover boy on every corner in town and it doesn't make a damn to them whether you're waiting on tables or picking cotton, so long as you cooperate. But it does make a damn to me!
BONNIE	Why?
CLYDE	Why? Because you're different! You're like me and you want different things.
CLYDE	You and me travelin' together, we could cut clean acrost this state, and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot, and catch ourselves highpockets and a highheeled ol' time. We can be somethin' we could never be alone. I'll show you...when we walk into the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone', you wearin' a silk dress, they'll be waitin' on you and believe me, sugar, they're gonna know your last name.
BONNIE	When'd you figure that all out?
CLYDE	First time I saw you.
BONNIE	How come?
CLYDE	'Cause you may be the best damn girl in Texas.
BONNIE	Who are you, anyway? bridges the scene: the question that BONNIE has just is now suddenly rebutted by CLYDE, as he points a at her.
CLYDE	I'll tell you about you. BONNIE's life, the more instinctively accurate he She grows more and more fascinated, like a child a mind reader.
CLYDE	Lessee...You were born somewheres around East Texas...got a big old family, right?...You went to school, of course, but you didn't take to it much 'cause you was a lot smarter than everybody else anyway. So you just quit. Now... ...When you were sixteen...no, seventeen, there was a guy who worked in...uh...
BONNIE	Cement plant--
CLYDE	Right. Cement plant. And you liked him 'cause he thought you was just as nice as you could be. You almost married that guy, but then...you thought, no, you didn't think you would. So you got your job in the cafe... And every morning you wake up and you hate it. You just hate it. And you get down there and you put on your white uniform--
BONNIE	Pink.
CLYDE	And the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over 'em, and you don't like it...And they ask you for dates and sometimes you go...but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not...and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will I ever get away from this?...And now you know. their food. A cheap, gaudy dame, she has spit curls on temple in the style of the times. CLYDE looks at her at BONNIE, who also wears spit curls. As soon as the leaves:
CLYDE	Change that. I don't like it. and takes out a mirror. She holds it up and with the hand, brushes back her spit curls into her hair. She again wears them. When she has pushed them back she at CLYDE for his approval. He nods his okay. She puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food. ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on plate. CLYDE doesn't touch his food, just watches eat for a minute.
CLYDE	God, you're a knockout. newer model car. BONNIE is surprised to see CLYDE head the newer car.
BONNIE	Hey, that ain't ours.
CLYDE	Sure it is.
BONNIE	But we came in this one.
CLYDE	Don't mean we have to go home in it. blanket. There are windows behind her. She looks bewildered.
BONNIE	Clyde...
BONNIE	Clyde...
CLYDE	Hey, lady.
BONNIE	Where you been keeping yourself?
CLYDE	Slept out by the car.
BONNIE	Oh...These accommodations ain't particularly deluxe.
CLYDE	No...If they're after us, I want the first shot. Come on, you got some work to do. six old bottles have been placed. As BONNIE joins he turns and fires six quick shots. The bottles
BONNIE	You're good.
CLYDE	The best.
BONNIE	And modest...
CLYDE	Come on. Got you all set up over here. means that to be BONNIE's target. He hands her a gun.
CLYDE	Set her spinnin'.
CLYDE	Again. Come down slow with it...
CLYDE	Ain't you something? I tell you I'm going to get you a Smith and Wesson, it'll be easier in your hand. Now try it again once... the tire.
FARMER	Heighdo.
FARMER	No sir...no sir. You all go right ahead.
FARMER	Used to be my place. Not any more. Bank took it. an Okie car loaded with belongings. A WOMAN with a BABY
FARMER	Yessir, moved us off. Now it belongs to them.
BONNIE	Well, that's a pitiful shame.
FARMER	You're damned right, ma'm.
FARMER	Me and him put in the years here. Yessir. So you all go right ahead. We just come by for a last look. him. CLYDE spins and fires three fast shots into the CLYDE offers the gun to the farmer. He looks at it, accepts it. He slowly takes aim at the sign and fires. pleases him. He looks at CLYDE and BONNIE who smile.
FARMER	You all mind?
FARMER	Hey, Davis! Come on over here. looks from BONNIE to the FARMER and toward the house. DAVIS slowly raises the gun and fires at another returns the gun as does DAVIS.
FARMER	Much obliged.
FARMER	Otis Harrison. And this here's Davis. We worked this place.
CLYDE	Miss Bonnie Parker. And I'm Clyde Barrow. and BONNIE in the b.g.
CLYDE	We rob banks.
CLYDE	You just stay in the car and watch and be ready. scared. He thinks Okay now? You just be ready if I need you.
CLYDE	Scared?
BONNIE	No.
CLYDE	What are you thinkin' about?
BONNIE	Nothin'. his talk, he is scared, too.
BONNIE	What are you waitin' for? right inside the bank, tracking very fast. gun at him.
CLYDE	This is a stickup. Just take it easy and nothin' will happen to you. Gimme the money.
TELLER	Heighdy.
CLYDE	Gimme the money!
TELLER	What money? There ain't no money here, mister.
CLYDE	What do you mean there ain't no money? This here is a bank, ain't it? and shuttered.
TELLER	This was a bank. We failed three weeks ago.
CLYDE	What? What?? the teller out the front door. is happening.
CLYDE	Tell her! Tell her!
TELLER	As I was tellin' this gentleman, our bank failed last month and ain't no money in it. I sure am sorry. of what's funny in the situation. She laughs she can't stop laughing. This makes CLYDE than ever. He shoves the teller to the ground. his gun out the window. each of the zeros. We see each zero shot through. the entire window hangs there for a second and suddenly On the soundtrack, BONNIE's laughter. mirth, but is quieting down because she sees that CLYDE really mad and can't be pushed too far.
CLYDE	We got $1.98 and you're laughin'.
CLYDE	Keep it running. b.g., almost out of our vision, is a BUTCHER--an enormous of a man. CLYDE steps up to the counter.
CLYDE	Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen eggs and a quart of milk. CLYDE pulls his gun.
CLYDE	This is a stickup. I'll take all the money in that drawer now. brandishing a meat cleaver. Camera looks up at formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down, CLYDE and sticking in the wooden counter. He grabs around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him the ground. The struggle is in silence. CLYDE is fighting wildly to get free. The gun in CLYDE's is pinned, because the man has CLYDE's arm pinned to thigh. CLYDE tries to raise the barrel at an upward enters the BUTCHER's stomach. The BUTCHER screams, reacts like a wounded animal, more furious than ever. still holds CLYDE in a fierce hug, staggering around the falls to his knees, but still he doesn't release In a panic, CLYDE drags the man to the door, trying get out. let go. CLYDE, in real panic, aims the gun at his and fires. Click. Out of bullets. In blind fury, he the BUTCHER's head with two terrific swipes. the BUTCHER lets go. Hysterical, CLYDE jumps away leaps into the car on the other side. BONNIE still at wheel.
CLYDE	Get the hell out of here! control of himself.
CLYDE	Damn him, that big son of a bitch... He tried to kill me... I ain't got eyes in back of my head... I didn't want to hurt him. It wasn't a real robbery... Some food and a little bit of dough. I'm not against him. Damn! and grease--clearly he has gotten in his licks on the without success. Neither he nor BONNIE seems by the noise C.W. is making. over. It purrs beautifully. CLYDE is astonished.
CLYDE	What was wrong, anyway?
C.W.	Air bubble--clogged the fuel line.
C.W.	I just blowed her away.
CLYDE	You just blowed it away. 'Scuse me, ma'm... Anythin' else I can do for you?
BONNIE	Well...I'm not sure... Say, them little red things there stickin' up? Are they gas pumps? Sure.
BONNIE	Isn't that interesting? How does that there gasoline get in my little old car?
C.W.	Well, y'see, there's this tank underground, and the gas comes up this tube into the pump and into your car, M'am.
BONNIE	My, you're a smart fellow. You sure know a lot about automobiles, don't you?
C.W.	Yeah, I do.
BONNIE	Well, would you know what kind of a car this is?
C.W.	Yeah, it's a Chevrolet 8-cylinder coupe.
BONNIE	No, no. Sure it is. No, this is a stolen Chevrolet 8- cylinder coupe.
CLYDE	You ain't scared, are you? I believe he is. What a pity. We sure coulda used a smart boy who knows such a great deal about automobiles. You a good driver, boy?
C.W.	I guess so.
CLYDE	No, I don't think so. He's better off here...
BONNIE	What's your name, boy?
C.W.	C.W. Moss.
BONNIE	What's the C.W. for?
C.W.	Clarence Wallace.
BONNIE	I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is Mr. Clyde Barrow. We... rob... banks.
CLYDE	Ain't nothing wrong with that, is there, boy? Uh, nope--
BONNIE	No, he ain't the one.
CLYDE	Unless, Boy, you think you got enough guts for our line of work?
C.W.	What do you mean? I served a year in the reform school.
BONNIE	Oh, a man with a record!
CLYDE	Now look here, I know you got the nerve to short-change old ladies who come in for gas, but what I'm askin' you is have you got what it takes to pull bank jobs with us?
BONNIE	Mr. C.W. Moss?
C.W.	Sure, I could. Sure I could. I ain't scared, if that's what you think.
CLYDE	Prove it. close it and come out. He emerges with a fistful of He walks over to BONNIE's window, sticks his hand and drops the money on her lap. We see the bills down. Not a word is spoken. BONNIE moves over into middle. C.W. opens the door and gets in behind the For a moment we see them all sitting there, each their little smile. CLYDE starts to hum a hillbilly quietly. The sound track picks it up (banjo and etc.) and as the music swells, they drive off down road. like a mountain over his enormous stomach, is the His head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a through a bent glass straw. Camera is on the left of the head of the bed, seeing the BUTCHER in a three- profile. On the opposite side of the bed stands a patrolman who is in the act of flashing mug-shot for the BUTCHER to identify his assailant. The holds a stack of them in front of them, swiftly the cards like a grade-school teacher with her cards. At each picture, the BUTCHER grunts negatively goes on sipping from his glass straw. One picture, two, go by. The fourth picture is a mug shot of CLYDE. the BUTCHER grunts 'no,' without hesitation. As the picture comes into view, we "MOTOR COURT". O.S. comes the measured snoring that we will comes from CLYDE. BONNIE raises up and kneels over She needs him. Clyde seems to snore on. Camera between them and we see that the snoring actually from C.W. BONNIE drops back on her pillow. We cut on CLYDE. He is awake. great concentration, as he does everything by relating the immediate action he happens to be involved with, he the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling over all his food. He sugars the meat, the beans, and beets. BONNIE and CLYDE watch this performance with amazement and second, disgust. They can't believe they see.
BONNIE	C.W., what are you doing? Why do you do that? Why not?
BONNIE	It's just disgusting, that's why.
C.W.	Not to me it ain't.
BONNIE	But...but it makes everything sweet!
C.W.	Yeah, I know.
C.W.	Damn! No mayonnaise! restaurant, out of our vision, apparently planning to mayonnaise over the sugar. The minute he is out of BONNIE gets CLYDE's attention.

CLYDE	Lemme show you about tomorrow.
BONNIE	Why?
CLYDE	Now C.W.'ll be waitin' right outside in the car. Here is the teller's cage. Four of them and over here the desks and what have you...
BONNIE	Why, Clyde...
CLYDE	Hmmm??
BONNIE	In the same room with us?
CLYDE	Hell, where else? Ain't gonna spread out all over the state... smile.
CLYDE	Not yet, anyway. Now, the door to the bank is here now. You cover me from there.
BONNIE	Just that I love you so much.
CLYDE	You're the best damn girl in Texas.
C.W.	Hey, you spilled the sugar.
CLYDE	The layout for tomorrow up in Mineola.
C.W.	Mineola? Gosh, that's four, five hundred miles from here!
CLYDE	So what? We take U.S. 85 to Willis Point, don't you know, and cut over on State Highway 28 at Kaufman, keep on goin' till we hit the farm- to-market road that connects to 105 and that's right up by Mineola. On a Saturday afternoon... sunny. The streets are filled with people, cars, C.W. The car pulls up in front of the bank, double-parked. and CLYDE get out.

BONNIE, somewhat the of the splash, jumps back and away. Recovering her she looks at C.W. who is slunk down in the tub a gross September Morn. She has tried him and he has she realizes now that he was no choice for her; no man, even if he might perform sexually. He is a lump. irritates her; his very presence is demeaning to and CLYDE.

CLYDE	Bonnie, I want to talk to you. Sit down. But she listens quietly.
CLYDE	This afternoon we killed a man and we were seen. Now nobody knows who you are yet, but they're going to be after me and anybody who's runnin' with me. Now that's murder now and it's gonna get rough. Look, I can't get out, but right now you still can. You say the word and I'll put you on the bus to go back to your Mother.

BUCK is a jovial, simple, big-hearted man. little chubby, given to raucous jokes, knee-slapping and reactions. He is, in many ways, the emotional opposite his brother. It doesn't take much to make him happy. his wife, is the direct opposite of BONNIE. not very ambitious, cuddly, simpering, madly in love BUCK and desirous of keeping their lives on the straight narrow. As the scene begins we hear and then see BUCK, singing "The Great Speckled Bird." BLANCHE is next to him looking at a movie magazine, appearing miserable.
BUCK	"What a beautiful thought I am thinking Concernin' that great speckled bird, Remember his name is recorded on the pages of God's Holy word..."
BLANCHE	All right, now you did foolish things as a young man, honey-love, but you went and paid your debt to society and that was right. But now you just gettin' back in with the criminal element.
BUCK	Criminal element! This is my brother, darlin'. Shoot, he ain't no more criminal than you are, Blanche.
BLANCHE	Well, that ain't what I heard.
BUCK	Now word of mouth just don't go, darlin', you gotta have the facts. Shoot. Why he and me growed up together, slept and worked side by side. God, what a boy he was!
BLANCHE	He's a crook.
BUCK	Now you stop bad-mouthin' him, Blanche. We're just gonna have us a little family visit for a few weeks and then we'll go back to Dallas and I'll get me a job somewheres. I just ain't gonna work in your Daddy's church--That's final. "What a beautiful thought I am thinking Concernin' that great speckled bird..."

BUCK	Just fine, just fine. Send their best to you.
CLYDE	Hey, you're fillin' out there. Must be that prison food.
BUCK	Hell no! It's married life. You know what they say, it's the face powder that gets a man interested, but it's the baking powder that keeps him at home. Hey! you gotta meet my wife. Hey, honey, c'mon out here now and meet my baby brother. she gets out of the car, still carrying the movie

C.W.	Well how do, Mrs. Barrow. Or can I call you Blanch? I sure am pleased to meet you. Did you have a hard time findin' us here in this neck of the woods? Well, you sure picked a good day for it. Say, you got a Screenland there! Any new photos of Myrna Loy? She's my favorite picture star. of it.

CLYDE	Let me take on of Bonnie.
BONNIE	Okay. out dressed.
BUCK	Hey, brother, let's you and me do a little talkin'.
CLYDE	Here, C.W., take the girls' picture. dark, shades pulled down. There is an aura of boys' secret camaraderie in the following scene:
BUCK	It was you or him, wasn't it?
CLYDE	Huh?
BUCK	That guy you killed. You had to, didn't ya?
CLYDE	Yeah, he put me in a spot, so I had to. He didn't have a Chinaman's chance.
BUCK	
CLYDE	Yeah. I had to.
BUCK	Don't say nothin' to Blanche about it.
CLYDE	Hey, that time you broke out of jail, she talk you into goin' back?
BUCK	Yeah, you hear about that?
CLYDE	I won't say nothin' to Bonnie about it.
BUCK	I appreciate it.
CLYDE	Yeah...say, what d'ya think of Bonnie?
BUCK	She's a real peach. asked each other all the questions and are now out of to say. It is too much for BUCK, the natural enemy silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts animatedly:
BUCK	Boy, are we gonna have us a good time!
CLYDE	We surely are!
BUCK	Yessir! What are we gonna do?
CLYDE	Well, how's this--I thought we'd all go to Missouri. They ain't lookin' for me there. We'll hole up someplace and have us a regular vacation. All right?
BUCK	No trouble, now?
CLYDE	No trouble. I ain't lookin' to go back to prison.
BUCK	Hey, what's this I hear about you cuttin' up your toes, boy?
CLYDE	That ain't but half of it. I did it so I could get off work detail-- breakin' those damned rocks with a hammer day and night. Sure enough, next week I got paroled. I walked out of that god-forsaken jail on crutches.
BUCK	Shoot--
CLYDE	Ain't life grand?
BUCK	And the doc, he takes him aside, says, "Son, your old mama just gettin' weak and sickly layin' there. I want you to persuade her to take a little Brandy, y'know, to pick her spirits up." "Why, doc," he says, "you know my mamma is a teetotaler. She wouldn't touch a drop." "Well, I tell you what," the doc says, "why don't you bring her a fresh quart of milk every day from your farm, 'cept you fix it up so half of it's Brandy and don't let on!" So he does that, doctors it up with Brandy, and his mamma drinks some of it. And the next day he brings it again and she drinks some more--and she keeps it up every day. Finally, one week later, he brings her the milk and don't you know she just shallows it all down, and looks at her bag and says, "Son, whatever you do, don't sell that cow!" the cozy and jolly scene preceding. We have dead BONNIE is driving, smoking a cigarette, grim. as far away as she can get from BONNIE falling out of the car--makes a face at the cigarette rolls down the window for air. C.W.'s in the back just staring. a dapper gent with keys in his hand. BUCK pays him. The a car into the driveway. C.W. follows, driving car with BLANCHE. CLYDE stops beside BUCK. BUCK into CLYDE's car and says:

BLANCHE (O.S.)	My, you need a haircut, Daddy. You look like a hillbilly boy. Gotcha!
C.W.	Again.
BUCK	Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me but you keep tryin' now.
BLANCHE	Jest like an ol' man. Plays checkers all the time and doesn't pay any attention to his poor lonely wife.
BUCK	Cut it out now, honey. I'm gonna teach this boy a lesson he'll never forget. a moment more, then she rises and with the most ingenuous miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with Barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation of lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual... Indeed the mimicry BONNIE to be physically freer with CLYDE, and allows to respond without anxiety, without self-consciousness. should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that could suddenly make it with BONNIE.
BONNIE	Oh, Daddy, you shore need a haircut. You look just like a little old hillbilly boy, I do declare. hand toying with the buttons on his shirt, her hand slipping Oh mercy me, oh my stars!
BONNIE	Oh, Daddy! Yore such a slowpoke!
CLYDE	Hush up a little. They're in the next room.
BONNIE	Shoot, there's always somebody in this room, the next room and ever' other kind of room. their bodies almost form a crooked cross. She digs an into his stomach.
CLYDE	Oof!...now that ain't no nice way to talk about my brother.
BONNIE	I ain't talking about your brother. cocks her head. When she speaks now it is with a simple
BONNIE	Honey, do you ever just want to be alone with Me? I don't just mean like that...I mean do you ever have the notion of us bein' out together and alone, like at some fancy ball, or, I don't know, where we walk in all dressed and they announce us and it's fancy and in public, but we're alone somehow. We're separate from everybody else, and they know it.
CLYDE	I always feel like we're separate from everybody else.
BONNIE	Do you, baby?
BONNIE	Quiet! I'll get it.
BONNIE	Who is it?

BONNIE	How much?
YOUNG MAN	Six dollars and forty-three cents.
YOUNG MAN	Here, M'am, them bags is heavy. Let me carry 'em up for you.
BONNIE	No thanks, I'll take 'em. the delivery boy's face, looking puzzled at this BONNIE reaches the top steps, and voices are heard.
BUCK'S VOICE	What was it?
CLYDE'S VOICE	Quiet. Open the door.
BONNIE	C'mon, c'mon...
BONNIE	It's called "The Ballad of Suicide Sal." "We each of us have a good alibi For being down here in the 'joint'; But few of them really are justified If you get right down to the point. You've heard of a woman's glory Being spent on a downright cur'."
BUCK'S VOICE (O.S.)	You write that all by yourself?
BONNIE	You want to hear this or not? BUCK is grinning. C.W. is blank. BLANCHE is in kitchen cooking.
BONNIE	"Still you can't always judge the story As true, being told by her. Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough--"
BUCK	Yeah, I knew her. She was cockeyed and had a hare-lip and no teeth! continues:
BONNIE	"Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough; She never once faltered from duty To play on the 'up and up'." above him, sees down the street. We see two police quietly pulling up. One of them parks sideways in the to block escape from the garage, the other stays on street. CLYDE turns and looks out the window.

The car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into street right at the group of firing police. The gang's and CLYDE are in front; BUCK and C.W. in the back firing back at police. The car pulls alongside the running BLANCHE; the back door is flung open and in the style of a cartoon, two hands reach out and lift off her feet and pull her into the car. They speed away. driver is shot and the car crashes into a tree. The is not being pursued now, but CLYDE is driving at 90. is moaning and crying. BONNIE, in front, turns furiously.

BLANCHE	What did I do wrong? I s'pose you'd be happier if I got shot.
BONNIE	Yeah, it would of saved us all a lot of trouble.
BLANCHE	Buck, don't let that woman talk to me like that!
BUCK	knowing Blanche is You shouldn't have done it, Blanche. It was a dumb thing to do.
BLANCHE	Please, Buck, I didn't marry you to see you shot up! Please, let's go! Let's get out of here and leave. Make him stop the car and let us out!
BUCK	Can't. I killed a man. We're in this now.
BLANCHE	Please! Please!
BONNIE	Shut up! Just shut up your big mouth! At least do that, will ya, just shut up.
CLYDE	Cut it out, Bonnie.
BONNIE	Stop the car. I want to talk to you.
CLYDE	What is it?
BONNIE	Get rid of her.
CLYDE	Can't do that. She's Buck's wife.
BONNIE	Get rid of both of them then.
CLYDE	Why? What's the matter with you anyway?
BONNIE	She's what's the matter with me, a damn stupid back country hick without a brain in her head. She ain't nothin' but prunes and proverbs.
CLYDE	What makes you any better? What makes you so damn special? You're just a West Dallas waitress who spent half your time pickin' up truck drivers!
BONNIE	You talk to me like that! Big Clyde Barrow, just the same as your brother, an ignorant uneducated hillbilly. Only special thing about you is your peculiar ideas about lovemakin'--which is no love makin' at all. quivering with anger. They have stripped each other CLYDE turns and looks back at the car. Everyone is watching them. He breathes a deep sigh, like a man to 10 to hold his temper.
CLYDE	Look, Bonnie-- her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has on him. She softens.
BONNIE	Clyde...honey...I didn't mean all that, honey. Blame it on all that shootin', I just felt so bad...sure enough...Clyde?
CLYDE	Okay...Okay, hon...let's get movin'... and acts aloof from the others waiting for her. She the car. CLYDE opens her door for her and she gets like a great lady. He walks around to his side, gets in, they drive off. For a moment that is all we see, then we should aware that far in the distance another car is CLYDE's. a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands into the car. They drive out of the shot. Camera holds soon the following car enters the shot. The man driving a Texas ranger. He drives slowly. He drives out of the
BUCK	Hey, y'all, listen to this here: Law enforcement officers throughout the Southwest are frankly amazed at the way in which will-of-the-wisp bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow- haired companion, Bonnie Parker, continue to elude their would-be captors. Since engaging the police in a gun battle on the streets of Joplin Missouri and slaying three of their number...
BLANCHE	Oh, Lord...
BUCK	...the Barrow gang has been reported as far West as White City, New Mexico, and as far north as Chicago. They have been credited with robbing the Mesquite Bank in the aforementioned White City, the J.J. Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas, the Sanger City National Bank in Denton, Texas on three different occasions. In addition to these robberies, the fast travelling Barrows have been rumored to have had a hand in the robbing of two Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and one A&P; store in Missouri, though Chief Percy Hammond, who first identified Clyde Barrow's brother, Buck, as a member of the gang, expressed some doubt that these last robberies were committed by the Barrow Gang alone.
BONNIE	Go on.
C.W.	Clyde, we ain't goin' to see a restroom for another thirty miles. Why don't you just stop here?
BUCK	Hey now, here's something! Listen here: Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers In Hunt For Barrow. Police Officer Howard Anderson's heart turned faster than his motorcycle when he forced to the side of the road a roaring black V-8 sedan in which were three men and a blondheaded woman yesterday afternoon. on the soundtrack. occupant of the car. He is tall, dressed in the of the Texas Ranger. He draws his gun and slowly the car from the rear. On the soundtrack BUCK's continues; as we see all this taking place.
BUCK	When he saw several machine guns in the car he was certain he'd caught Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and maybe Buck Barrow and the third unidentified member of the gang. It took a lot of telephoning and explaining to convince the motorcycle cop that his captives were two highway patrolmen and a blonde-haired stenographer from the Highway Patrol--. Haw! Haw! of the woods, behind the lawman. His gun is tucked in pants. In a second, he sees what is happening.
BUCK	Anderson was held up as an example for every other Texas peace officer today. "That was a mighty brave thing," explained Highway Patrol Chief L.C. Winston. like a classic fast-draw in an heroic Western.
CLYDE	Sheriff! SHERIFF's hand. A really razzle-dazzle display of marksmanship from Clyde. guns drawn.
C.W.	Boy! What a shot, Clyde!
BUCK	Sweet Jesus, I never seen shootin' like that! while he frisks him. In general, everyone is over the capture. BONNIE takes the sheriff's gun delicately places it on the radiator grill like an d'art.
CLYDE	Well, now, getta load of this. I want y'all to know we are in the custody of Cap'n Frank Bryce, and Frank here is a Texas Ranger. powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood, as tho might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper. His stare toward camera relentlessly, unblinking, but passion. They are shark's eyes. They have witnessed carnage, devoured it, and are still wide open for more. Sure 'nough, Clyde?
BUCK	Say there, peacemaker. I believe you got your spurs all tangled up. You're in Missouri, you know that?
CLYDE	You didn't know you was in Missouri?
C.W.	He's lost, this here Texas Ranger.
CLYDE	--he ain't lost...them banks are offerin' extra reward money fer us, and Frank figured on easy pickin's, didn't you? Didn't you?
CLYDE	--Now you ain't hardly doin' your job, Texas Ranger. You oughta be home lookin' after the rights of poor folks, not out chasin' after us.
BUCK	Easy there, Clyde. Why take is so personal.
CLYDE	Reg'lar laws is one thing. But this here bounty hunting, we got to discourage that. but BUCK intervenes.
BUCK	Like how, Clyde?--
C.W.	Shoot him. want.
C.W.	...hang him?...
BONNIE	--uh-uh. Take his picture.
C.W.	Take his picture?
BONNIE	Then we'll let the newspapers have it--so's everyone can see Captain Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers with the Barrow gang-- --and all bein' just as friendly as pie.
BUCK	...yeah, yeah...
BONNIE	--why we 'bout the friendliest folks in the world. Texas Ranger waves his big ol' gun at us, and we just welcome him like he's one of our own.
CLYDE	Buck, get the Kodak!
BUCK	Hot dog!
CLYDE	We're mighty proud to have a Texas Ranger in the family. dialogue is overlapped, ad-libbed, etc. A sense mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to to CLYDE's speech below it.
BUCK	...keep him set on the hood, there...more to the sun, like that...yeah...when all his ranger friends see this...I bet he's gonna wish he was dead!
CLYDE	...see what come o' your mischief?...not doin' your job? Down in Duncanville last year poor farmers kepts the laws away from us with shot guns...you're s'posed to be protectin' them from us, and they're protectin' us from you. --don't make sense, do it?
BUCK	C'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie first. Move into him, right close, right friendly.
CLYDE	All righty Don't move, now, hear? up admiringly from the other side. BUCK takes the

He pulls BRYCE off fender by the handcuffs, spinning him around crazily a lasso. BRYCE is literally ricocheted off the car by force, and, with CLYDE hanging on by the cuffs, plummets the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men spinning. BRYCE rises shakily. He tries to walk CLYDE grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him
BUCK	I got the picture. I got the picture...
CLYDE	Lemme be, lemme be... one of the oars. BUCK upends BRYCE into the skiff and it spinning. CLYDE picks up an oar and hurls it like boomerang, ass over end at the skiff. It kicks up a spray.
BUCK	I got the PICTURE!

BUCK	Uh, Clyde...well...what about Blanche? to get her cut.
BONNIE	WHAT?
BLANCHE	Well, why not? Say I earned my share! Same as everybody. I coulda got killed same as everybody, and I'm wanted by the law same as everybody. Besides I coulda got snake bit sleepin' in them woods every night! I'm just a nervous wreck and that's the truth. And I have to listen to sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all the time. I deserve mine!
CLYDE	Okay...okay...hold your horses, Blanche. You'll get your share. C.W. looks indignant, like a hog who's just been a bath. CLYDE begins counting all over again in near

CLYDE	Look, Bonnie, I've said it and I guess I'll keep sayin' it before we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife and Buck is family.
BONNIE	--she's such a silly-Billy...
BONNIE	My family could use some of that money.
CLYDE	Them laws have been hangin' round your mamas house 'til all hours, Bonnie. It's just too risky to go there.
BONNIE	Well, where can we go? We rob the damn banks, what else do we do?
C.W.	CLYDE! CLYDE! CLYDE!
CLYDE	I hear you, C.W.
C.W.	This ol' heap's gushin' oil! We got to swipe us another set of wheels right away, or we won't get anywhere. Look here.
C.W.	See? neighborhood. The camera is up on a porch of a frame house, looking toward the street. On the porch, in the swing in the left f.g. are a MAN and a WOMAN. with his back to us, embracing the WOMAN. They are making low, loving murmurs.
WOMAN	Oh, now...now, dear...
MAN	Mmmm...sweet thing... ditches the one car and gets in one of the parked cars. the while the couple on the porch is busy spooning. The begins to roll slowly into the street. The WOMAN notices.
WOMAN	Say, isn't that your car, Eugene?
MAN	Mmmmmm...huh? That's my car! Hey!
EUGENE	I'll tear 'em apart! Those punks! Steal a man's car right out from under him! Wait till I get my hands on those kids, Velma, I'll show 'em! see through their windshield the other car way in the
VELMA	What if they have guns, Eugene?
EUGENE	We'd better get the police and let them handle this.
VELMA	Right. Turn around and let's get back to town. We'll go get the sheriff. around in the narrow space. They start back to town.
BUCK	They stopped chasin' us. They turned around.
CLYDE	Let's take 'em. the car around. He performs the U-turn in the same space in one, swift, smooth, beautiful turn.
VELMA	Oh, my Lord, they're comin' after us.
EUGENE	Step on it, Velma, step on it! on them and finally overtaking them, coming up and forcing them to the side of the road. against the window, flattening their features, making gestures at the shaking pair inside. We see this the point of view of the MAN and WOMAN inside the car. pulls out a gun, makes as if to shoot, but he is They all laugh uproariously, especially BUCK who delighted with CLYDE's prank. All of this we see in from inside the trapped car.
CLYDE	C'mon, get out! Get out of there, I said.
CLYDE	Get in here. inside. CLYDE drives, BONNIE next to him, C.W. next her. In back, BLANCHE, then EUGENE with VELMA (of sitting on his lap, and then BUCK. As will be the reason the Barrows have kidnapped the couple is that they wanted company. Living as they do, seeing each other day after day, they long for diversion and faces. So the atmosphere in the car will shortly change one of friendliness and jollity, and it will get more so in the series of cuts which advance time. As the car starts up at the beginning, however, MAN and WOMAN are terrified.
BUCK	What's your name?
EUGENE	I'm Eugene Grizzard.
VELMA	I'm Velma Davis.
BUCK	Well, howdy! We're the Barrow gang. That there is Clyde drivin' and I'm Buck. realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the are friendly to them.
BONNIE	Look, don't be scared, folks. It ain't like you was the law. You're just folks like us.
EUGENE	Yeah, yeah, that's the truth.
CLYDE	I expect you been readin' about us. is the right thing to say under the circumstances.
EUGENE	Yes.
VELMA	No.
EUGENE	Yes, Velma, we have too.
BONNIE	Well, you two must be in love, I bet.
BUCK	Well, when you gonna marry the girl, boy? atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives enjoying their new friends. As the scene starts, BUCK finishing his joke.
BONNIE	So then she drinks her milk down again, every drop. And she looks over at her son and says, "Son, whatever you do, don't sell that cow!" car doesn't laugh--this is the tenth time they've heard joke.
BONNIE	How old are you, honey?
VELMA	Thirty-three. they stopped somewhere along the way for food. the crowded interior, it is like a party--food is being back and forth, laughter and gaiety, increasing between the couple and the Barrows. The car has a little society on wheels, dashing through the black down the highway. Inside there is a small world of and fun.
VELMA	Now I ordered some French fries, didn't I?
BUCK	Yeah, here you go.
CLYDE	Take it easy on those French fries, Velma. Ain't that right, Eugene?
EUGENE	This isn't mine. I ordered mine well done. Who's got the other hamburger?
C.W.	Oh, is this supposed to be yours?
EUGENE	That's okay, forget it.
BUCK	Haw! I sure am havin' a good time! How 'bout you folks? Ain't you glad we picked you up?
CLYDE	Hey, maybe y'all ought to join up with us.
EUGENE	Ha! Wouldn't they be surprised back home to hear that?
VELMA	Yeah. What would Martha and Bill say if they heard that?
EUGENE	Lordy! They'd throw a fit! What do you do, anyway?
EUGENE	I'm an undertaker. death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car. The changes to cold, deadly, fearful silence in one second. It is a premonition of death for the and they react accordingly, BONNIE especially.
BONNIE	Get them out of here. off into the lonely night. inevitable for the Barrow gang, that it follows them that it waits anywhere. It is no longer a question whether death will come, but when it will. here that for a moment we might think he is from something rather than looking for something. and BUCK and BLANCHE beside him, is patrolling up ahead of him.
CLYDE	...see anythin', Buck? comment on it.
BUCK	--not yet, boy.
CLYDE	three of them might --and nobody saw her leave, or heard anythin' ...C.W....?
CLYDE	...Well, where do you think she could've gone?...Buck?...Buck?
BUCK	Jesus, I don't know... fields--the car keeping up beside him as he runs and we before both car and CLYDE. suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly, car's POV, a little comically.
CLYDE	There! There! There! and picks up the stocking he had spotted, takes it and on. now. As he runs on, he clears a knoll and BONNIE, yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance, comes view. She's far off in the cornfield, stalking off, neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper that has split, from which she has occasionally lost CLYDE screams, "BONNIE." She apparently doesn't suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting the remaining clothes spilling out. There is a chase where they each try to get the advantage.

BONNIE'S UNCLE	Where y'all headed from here?
CLYDE	I don't know, what y'all got in mind? At this point we ain't headin' to anywhere, we're just runnin' from.
BONNIE'S SISTER'S VOICE	C'mon, down, Litte Tom! We're goin' home. Little Tom? Mathew, fetch Little Tom.

CLYDE	--and they can't do that. Why, I'm even better at runnin' than robbin' banks--aw shoot, if we done half the stuff they said we did, we'd be millionaires, wouldn't we, old sugar. And I wouldn't risk Bonnie here just to make money, uncertain as times are. Why one time I knowed of a job where we could of make $2000 easy, but I saw the law outside and I said to myself, why Bonnie could get hurt here. So I just drove right on and let that money lay. a little abstractedly.

CLYDE	We'll be quittin' this just as soon as the hard times is over, Mother Parker, I can tell you that. Why me and Bonnie were just talkin' the other day and we talked about when we'd settle down and get us a home, and Bonnie said, "I couldn't bear to live morn'n three miles from my precious mother." Now how'd you like that, Mother Parker? CLYDE's speech--as if something had suddenly come focus before the old woman's eyes.
MOTHER	Don't believe I would. I surely don't. You try to live three miles from me and you won't live long, honey. You'd best keep runnin' and you know it, Clyde Barrow.

BONNIE	I said go somewhere else! and hurls them--an ashtray, a Gideon Bible, and a pot--at the little group. The pot goes shattering the wall. Everyone ducks.
CLYDE	Bonnie's hungry, C.W. I saw a chicken place a few miles back. Who all wants to go get some food?

Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow	Gang I'm sure you all have read How they rob and steal And those who squeal Are usually found dying or dead.
They call them cold-hearted killers;	They say they are heartless and mean; But I say this with pride, That I once knew Clyde When he was honest and upright and clean. Kept taking him down And locking him in a cell, Till he said to me, "I'll never be free So I'll meet a few of them in hell."
The road was so dimly lighted;	There were no highway signs to guide; But they made up their minds If all roads were blind, They wouldn't give up till they died. up and continues reading it. He reads it in a halting
HAMER	The road gets dimmer and dimmer; Sometimes you can hardly see; But it's fight man to man, And do all you can, For they know they can never be free.

BONNIE	If they try to act like citizens And rent them a nice little flat About the third night They're invited to fight By a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.

C.W.	Why, Daddy?
MALCOLM	You just listen to your Pa fer once! Cain't you do that? I'm yore Daddy, I'm your kin, not Clyde.

CLYDE	Bonnie? Bonnie, will you marry me? Then she talks in a voice falsely formal, still up at the ceiling.
BONNIE	How could I do that, Clyde? You know it's impossible. We'd have to go to a Justice of the Peace and the Justice of the Peace is a lawman. We couldn't even take out a license.
CLYDE	Hey now, you sound like you been givin' it some thought on your own.

CLYDE	To make an honest woman out of you.
BONNIE	Clyde...what would you do, what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again, clean, with no record, with nobody after us?
CLYDE	Well...I guess I'd do it all different. First off, I wouldn't live in the same state where we pull our jobs. We'd live in one state and stay clean there, and when we wanted to take a bank, we'd go to another state...and...

CLYDE	Bonnie?
CLYDE	Hey, Bonnie? and put them inside.

BONNIE	He stopped off in that hardware store to get light bulbs for his daddy.
CLYDE	Boy, my feet are sweatin'.
