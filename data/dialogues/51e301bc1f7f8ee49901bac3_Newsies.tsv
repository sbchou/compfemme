BOOTS	Ride 'em, cowboy!
JACK	Ya miss me, Weasel?
WEASEL	You know my name -- it's Weisel. Mister Weisel to you. How many?
JACK	Don't rush me -- I'm perusin' * the mercandice... Mr. Weasel. * The Newsies love it as Jack deliberately takes a paper, with a fifty-cent piece. JACK The usual. Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his * WEASEL Hundred for the wiseguy -- next! * JACK scans the newspaper for a catchy headline; Race, Crutchy, -- at the window, Weasel is in David's face. *
WEASEL	Ya got ya papes -- move outta here. *
DAVID	I paid for twenty -- you only gave * me nineteen! WEASEL You callin' me a liar, kid...? David's sweating, aware that all eyes are on him. *
DAVID	I want that other paper. The Delanceys start for David when suddenly Jack steps * JACK Nineteen, Weasel. An honest mistake -- on account of Oscar * can't count to twenty with his * shoes on. * Weasel glowers -- but wants to get back to business. He WEASEL Next! JACK Hold it. Race -- spot me two-bits. Race flips him a coin. Jack slaps it on the counter. JACK Another fifty for my friend here. DAVID I don't want another fifty -- !
JACK	Sure you do. Every newsie wants more papes.
DAVID	These papers are yours, I don't * take charity from nobody! I don't * even know who you are -- LES Cowboy! They call him Cowboy! JACK That and a lotta other things -- including Jack Kelly, which is what my mudder called me. What do they call you, kid?
LES	Les. This is David, he's my brother. He's older.
JACK	No kiddin'. How old are you, Les? Near ten.
JACK	No good. Anybody asks, you're seven. Younger sells more papes, Les -- and if we're gonna be partners -- DAVID Hold it! Who said anything about partners -- ?
JACK	You owe me two bits, right? Okay, so I consider it an investment. We sell together, split 70-30, plus you get the benefit of observin' me -- no charge. CRUTCHY You're gettin' the chance of a lifetime here -- you learn from Jack, you learn from the best. DAVID If he's the best, then why does he need us? JACK I don't need you, pal. But I ain't * got a cute little brother to front * for me. And Les here... * ... With this kid's puss and my God-given talent, we can easy move a thousand papers a week. Whattaya say? Deal?
DAVID	Gotta split fifty-fifty.
JACK	Sixty-forty. Or I forget the whole t'ing. David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his already being the mentor -- JACK The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only took twenty papes -- why?
DAVID	Bad headline...?
JACK	First t'ing you gotta learn -- headlines don't sell papes, newsies sell papes. We're what holds this town together -- without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'! They move away from Newsie Square as above them, the
PULITZER (O.S.)	'Trolley Strike Drags On for Third Week' -- this so-called headline drags on for infinity! A hand smashes the paper onto an ornate desk beyond which SEITZ The news is slow, Chief, the Trolley Strike's all we got -- It's all Mr. William Randolph Hearst has, too -- see how he covers the strike! The magnifying glass swings to a copy of the New York
PULITZER	Hearst is killing us in the circulation war -- and you give me headlines that would put a whirling dervish to sleep! BUNSEN We'll get a new headline writer, Mr. Pulitzer. PULITZER Steal Hearst's man -- offer him double what Hearst pays. SEITZ That's how he stole him from us. Chief, you spend as much as you make fighting Hearst. That's why the paper's losing money -- PULITZER I created the World to be the best and I'll spend whatever it takes to -- What is that deafening noise?
SEITZ	Just the Newsies, Chief, I'll -- PULITZER Never mind -- where was I? *
SEITZ	Creating the World, Chief. *
PULITZER	This paper's losing money because there's too much fat, inefficiency -- not because I'm fighting to * make us number one! Well, we're going to cut costs, maximize profits -- and still beat the socks off Hearst -- I want to know how by tonight.
JACK	Some newsies got corners, see -- same spot, same customers. Me, * I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That's the advantage of being an independent businessman, instead * of workin' for wages. *
DAVID	Paper, mister? Without breaking the kiss, the man kicks out at David
LES	Extry -- 'Runaway Carriage Crushes Cop!' Oh, honey... look at that sweet little lamb... David, watching with Jack, can't believe this. Les comes
LES	He gimme a dime! He said I should go far away and keep the change!
JACK	You're a natural, kid. You remind me of me -- and I can't say greater than that. DAVID Extra, 'Trolley strike drags on!'
JACK	Nextry, nextry -- 'Ellis Island in flames -- big con-fla-gration!'
DAVID	What -- ? Where's that story -- ?
JACK	Page nine -- thank you, sir. Nextry, 'Thousands flee in panic -- '
DAVID	'Trash fire near immigration building frightens seagulls -- ?'
JACK	'Terrified flight from flaming inferno!' Thank you, much obliged -- David is incredulous -- then sees Les by the boxers
LES	Buy me last pape, mista...?
DAVID	Our father taught us not to lie.
JACK	Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education.
DAVID	You just make things up -- like those headlines. JACK I don't do nothin' the guys who write this stuff don't do. It ain't lyin' -- it's just improvin' the truth a little. Les comes running back, wiping his mouth, with a quarter.
LES	The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some more last papers! DAVID Hold it -- I smell beer!
LES	The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some -- that's how I made the quarter!
JACK	Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'? There he is, officer -- do your duty! Jack spins, sees the man --
JACK	Beat it -- the bulls! He races off. David, confused, races after him, Les
LES	Just for one little sip of beer -- ?
SNYDER	You, Sullivan! Stop, I say! You hear me, Sullivan? DAVID Who's Sullivan -- ?
JACK	Mistaken identity -- all micks look alike to these birds!
LES	One sip! I didn't even swallow it! Jack leads them into the doorway of --
SNYDER	You young miscreant! Wait'll I get you back to the Refuge!
DAVID	The Refuge -- ?
JACK	Sleeper!
DAVID	I'm not crossing that! Anyway, I don't think they're chasing us -- JACK No? What're they doin' then? DAVID I think they're chasing you! Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David, DAVID I want some answers -- Why was he chasing you? What's the Refuge?
JACK	The Refuge is this jail for kids. That guy, Snyder, he's the warden.
LES	You were in jail...? Why?
JACK	I was starvin'. I stole some food.
DAVID	Right, food. He called you 'Sullivan' -- JACK Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm lyin'?
DAVID	You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you?
JACK	Because I escaped.
LES	Oh, boy. How? JACK This big shot gimme a ride out in his carriage. Bet it was the mayor, right? JACK Nah. Teddy Roosevelt. Ever heard of him? David starts to reply when he sees something behind Jack * MEDDA What is the meaning of this? No one is allowed backstage -- you will leave at once! Out, out, out, out -- JACK You wouldn't kick me out without a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda? Surprised, she gasps in delight -- throwing her arms MEDDA Kelly, where've you been, kid? I miss you up in the balcony -- you know I sing all my songs to you.
JACK	This is David and Les. And this is the greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the Swedish Meadowlark.
MEDDA	Welcome! Medda also owns the joint.
MEDDA	Don't ever own a theater, kid. Don't even think about it. DAVID I won't. I promise.
MEDDA	What have we here -- ? Aren't you the cutest little fella that ever was -- yes, you are --
LES	Buy my last pape, lady? A Camille-cough. Medda looks at him critically.
MEDDA	This kid is good. Speaking as one professional to another, I'd say you got a future.
JACK	Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? 'Til a little problem outside goes away?
MEDDA	As long as you like -- now the lark must warble. Hey, you -- -- give my guests whatever they want. She winks at the dazzled boys and hits the stage,
MEDDA	'MY LOVEY-DOVEY BABY'... etc.
OMITTED 27	thru DAVID It's late, my folks'll be worried ... What about yours? JACK They're out west lookin' for a place for us to live -- -- like this. It's the cover of a dime novel with a blue-perfect sky
JACK	That's Sante Fe -- out in New Mexico? Soon's Pop finds us the right ranch, they're sendin' for me. LES Then you'll be a real cowboy...
DAVID	Why don't we divvy up at my place...? You can meet my folks...
MOB	Scabs! Soak the scabs! Etc.
DAVID	Jack -- let's get outta here -- ! The boys move away, Jack looking back at the beating.
JACK	Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline.
ESTHER	My God...! What happened?
DAVID	He's just sleeping, Momma --
MAYER	We've been waiting dinner -- where've you been? David says nothing; crosses to the table and dumps the
MAYER	You made all this selling papers...? DAVID Half of it's Jack's -- he's our selling partner. And our friend. This is my parents. Jack nods awkwardly, starts to say something when SARAH, tongue-tied.
DAVID	That's Sarah. My sister. She smiles -- Jack still can't find his tongue. Mayer,
MAYER	Esther -- maybe David's partner would like to stay for dinner. Add some more water to the soup. ESTHER Mayer...! Mayer laughs, joined by Sarah and David -- and finally Les mumbles in his sleep on a board stretched between regained, holds forth at the dinner table.
JACK	What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work -- just a little more, thanks -- -- I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat.
MAYER	That many...? JACK More when the headline's good.
SARAH	What makes a headline good? JACK Catchy words -- like, uh, 'corpse' or 'maniac,' or, let's see, 'love nest' or 'nude' -- Sarah and David giggle; Esther looks shocked.
JACK	'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much...
MAYER	You talk fine, Jack -- Sarah, get that cake your mother's been hiding in the cabinet! ESTHER That's for your birthday tomorrow! MAYER I've had enough birthdays! This is a celebration! David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious chocolate cake from a cabinet -- DAVID It's only the beginning -- the longer I work, the more I'll make -- MAYER You work only until I go back to the factory! Then you go back to school, like you promised. MAYER It will heal... they'll give me back my job... I'll make them... Jack sees how worried the family is. No one seems able
LES	'Gimme all ya got, baby...' belongs...
JACK	How'd your pop get hurt? DAVID The factory. An accident. He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him.
MAYER	David? Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby,
DAVID	Why don't you stay here tonight...? JACK I got my own place... but thanks. * Your family's real nice, Dave. * Like mine. * David nods, climbs in the window. * DAVID See you tomorrow. Carryin' the banner.
JACK	Carryin' the banner. SONG: "SANTE FE": 3:06

JACK	How'd it go at the track, Race?
RACETRACK	That hot tip I told you about? Nobody told the horse. They smile and continue into --
KLOPPMAN	You missed your supper, boys.
RACETRACK	Then we didn't miss much, did we? * JACK I ate, Mr. Kloppman, I... ... I was dinin' with a family. inside it. Then he removes -- -- a photograph: faded, dog-eared. Against a Coney smiling man and woman beam down at a small boy in a staring at it...
JONATHAN	Actual income, as well as projected income, against actual operating costs, as well as projected operating costs, produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn --
PULITZER	Seitz! What in blazes is he talking about?
SEITZ	Says you need to make more money, Chief. PULITZER Of course I need to make more money! But how do I make more money, you bloodless blot? JONATHAN I have several proposals. The first is to increase the paper's price --
PULITZER	Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant.
JONATHAN	Not the customer price -- the price to the distribution apparatus. Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation. SEITZ You mean the Newsies...? Charge the Newsies more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief. JONATHAN Very well. My next proposal -- salary cuts, particularly those at the very top -- PULITZER Wait. What do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers? If you raised it to sixty cents --
JONATHAN	A mere tenth of a cent per paper --
PULITZER	-- then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week -- well, it would pay some of the bills around here.
SEITZ	Chief, if you do this, every Newsie we got will head straight for Hearst. PULITZER Not necessarily. As newspapermen, Hearst and I would cut each other's throats to get the best of the other. But as businessmen -- and gentlemen -- we often agree on ways to keep down certain operating costs. If I know Willie Hearst, he's going to wish he thought of this himself.
SEITZ	What about the other papers -- ? PULITZER If we do it, they'll all do it. It's only a tenth of a cent -- nobody gets hurt! It's good for the Newsies -- an incentive, make 'em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on that contraption. Seitz sighs and reaches for the phone. KID BLINK They jacked up the price! Ten cents a hunnerd -- I can eat two * days on ten cents! *
SKITTERY *	This'll bust me -- I'm barely * makin' a livin' now -- * BOOTSY * I'll be back sleepin' on * the streets -- *
MUSH	It don't make no sense! All the money Pulitzer makes, why would he gouge us? Jack sees Weasel behind his window, grinning.
JACK	Awright, pipe down! Don't you see it's a gag? Just Weasel bein' a weasel. Joke's over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd. He plops fifty cents on the counter. Weasel's grin
WEASEL	Hunnerd'll cost ya sixty, Cowboy.
JACK	I ain't payin' no sixty -- WEASEL Then move outta the way -- JACK You bet -- I move right over to the Journal.
RACETRACK	It's the same at the Journal -- we checked -- it's the same everywhere!
JACK	Why the jack-up, Weasel? WEASEL Why not? It's a nice day. Why don't you ast Mr. Pulitzer? He whacks the bell with his cudgel; the Delanceys stir threateningly.
WEASEL	If you ain't buyin' papes, clear out! World employees only on this sida the gates. It stinks here anyway -- let's go!
KID BLINK	They can't do that to us -- RACETRACK They can do what they want -- it's their stinkin' paper -- BOOTS Ain't we got no rights -- ?
CRUTCHY	Sure -- we got the right to take it in the t'roat!
RACETRACK	It's a rigged deck -- why waste time kiddin' ourselves? They set the price, we gotta pay it -- MUSH We got no choice! So let's get our lousy papes while they still got some -- JACK Nobody's goin' anywhere -- they ain't gonna get away with this!
EVERYBODY	
LES	Stop crowding him! Let him think!
RACETRACK	Jack...? Ya still thinkin'... ? * Jack looks at him, then the others: his jaw set.
JACK	One thing for sure. If we don't sell papes, then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was. DAVID You mean like a strike...?
JACK	Yeah, a strike -- good idea, Dave.
DAVID	No, I didn't mean -- we can't strike, we're not a union --
JACK	We go on strike, we're a union, right? Keep it comin', Dave --
DAVID	There's not enough of us -- maybe if we got every Newsie in New York -- JACK Yeah, we organize -- we get all the New York Newsies to join us! This is great, Dave, keep talkin' -- DAVID It's no joke! You saw what happened to those trolley workers -- JACK Another great idea! Any Newsie don't join with us, we soak 'im -- just like the trolley workers!
DAVID	Nooo! Stop and think, willya? You can't just rush everybody into this!
JACK	Dave's right again! We gotta think this through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers, they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them? The choice has gotta be yours -- are we gonna just take what they give us? Or do we strike? The Newsies are silent, faltering, suddenly uncertain.
LES	Strike!
BOOTS	Keep talkin', Jack -- tell us what to do --
DAVID	Uh... uh... Pulitzer and Hearst JACK Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect the workin' boys of New York! Keep it comin' -- what else.
DAVID	Uh... they can't treat us like we don't exist... SONG: "THE WORLD WILL KNOW" APPROXIMATE TIME: 3:30.
JACK	PULITZER AND HEARST THEY THINK WE'RE NOTHING ARE WE NOTHING? NEWSIE NO! If we stick together like the trolley workers, they can't break us up. JACK THEY THINK THEY GOT US DO THEY GOT US?
NEWSIES	NO! DAVID It's like a union. The Newsboy's Union. Are we really a union...? JACK GOT HATS OR BADGES WE'RE A UNION JUST BY SAYING SO... AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW
BOOTS	What's to stop someone else from sellin' our papes?
JACK	We talk to 'em. RACETRACK Some of 'em don't hear so good. JACK Then we soak 'em.
DAVID	No! JACK WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO STOP THE WAGONS? ARE WE READY? NEWSIES YEAH!
DAVID	No! We can't beat up kids in the street! It'll destroy what we're trying to do! JACK WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE Jack's not listening now. TO STOP THE SCABBERS?
NEWSIES	YEAH! WE'LL DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO UNTIL WE BREAK THE WILL OF MIGHTY BILL AND JOE ALL * AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW AND THE JOURNAL TOO * HAVE WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU NOW THE WORLD WILL HEAR WHAT WE'VE GOT TO SAY BUT WE'RE MAKIN' 'EM TODAY AND OUR RANKS WILL GROW Crutchy hobbles forward, raising his crutch. CRUTCHY AND WE'LL KICK THEIR REAR AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN... Jack jumps down from the statue. JACK ... HERE! He jumps onto the back of a wagon. JACK WHEN THE CIRCULATION BELL Two wagonloads of nervous STARTS RINGING Newsies come through the WILL WE HEAR IT? gate. Some leap off and join the strikers -- most NEWSIES stay on the wagon. NO! JACK WHAT IF THE DELANCEYS COME OUT SWINGING WILL WE HEAR IT?
NEWSIES	NO! WHEN YA GOT A HUNDRED VOICES SINGING, WHO CAN HEAR A LOUSY WHISTLE BLOW? AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW Jack steps forward. SO THEY GAVE THEIR WORD Boots angrily throws a piece of rotten fruit toward The World Building. BUT IT AIN'T WORTH BEANS MEANS AND THE TIME IS NOW AND THE FEAR IS GONE Boots, apprehensive, looks up at Jack in the wagon. BOOTS AND OUR NAME IS MUD AND THE STRIKE IS ON BOOTS AND I CAN'T STAND BLOOD

JACK	Well, he don't make me nervous. You and me, Boots, we take Brooklyn. Dave can keep us company. Okay, Dave? Sure. Right after you take our demands to Pulitzer. JACK Me? To Pulitzer? DAVID You're the leader.
JACK	Maybe the kid'll soften him up a little.

DAVID	Are we really an important story...? DENTON What's important? A year ago I covered the war in Cuba -- charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt. A very important story. Now it doesn't seem so important -- except Teddy's our governor and probably on his way to the White House. Is the Newsies' strike important? It all depends on you.
JACK	My name really gonna be in the papers?
DENTON	Any objections?

SPOT	So they told me. And what did they tell you? David looks nervously at the circling henchmen. DAVID That... they're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does. That you're the key... That Spot Conlon is the most respected and... famous... newsie in New York... and probably everywhere else...
DAVID	And... if Spot Conlon joins the strike, they'll join and we'll be unstoppable so you gotta join and ... well... you gotta... He trails off. Spot nods, turns to Jack.

SPOT	Not good enough, Jackie-boy. You gotta show me.
JACK	Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy -- -- or maybe you traded 'em to some chicken for that beak of yours. Maybe you gotta show me you ain't afraid to join the strike. Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed; Spot grins. Nice try, pal. But that's just what I'm talkin' about. Show me this strike ain't just some kids do-or-dare, then we'll talk. hoops, play marbles, tag, leap-frog, etc. Looks like more of a holiday than a strike. Jack, David, Boots

DAVID	Teddy's not like other politicians. He's the biggest hero in the country. Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he's wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin' -- 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!'

DAVID	One way to find out. Meet me back at the square! David runs after the carriage, leaping onto its back. He OMITTED 121 SEITZ Get him inside.
JACK	Very impressive. So where do they keep the trains in this station? Seitz shows him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to
JACK	Sorry to see you ain't doin' so good, Joe. * PULITZER Know what I was doing when I was your age? I was in a war. The Civil War. I heard of it. You win?
PULITZER	People think wars are about right and wrong. They're not. They're about power. You know what power is? Heard of that, too. I don't just sell ya papes, Joe. Sometimes I read 'em. Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly. PULITZER Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change -- and you'd have more money than you'd likely ever earn.
JACK	You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike -- PULITZER I disagree. You're the spirit of the strike, without you, they'd fall apart in a few days.
JACK	Ring for my coach, willya? It's past my bedtime --
PULITZER	Shut your mouth and listen ! You're going to do exactly as I say -- JACK -- or what? You'll send me back to the Refuge? I'll bust out again -- PULITZER -- and be a fugitive who's pursued and caught and returned. I'm offering you a choice -- is that what you choose?
JACK	I told ya... I can't call off the strike.
PULITZER	I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job -- as Newsie for the The World. JACK And be a scab? Forget it -- PULITZER For a few days. Then the strike ends -- and it will end, boy, make no mistake -- and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket... and no one chasing you. Jack is silent, troubled. Pulitzer pushes a buzzer. PULITZER You go back to the Refuge. Think it over in your cell. Let me know in the morning.
DAVID	Jack! Jack is surprised. He looks at Snyder and Seitz, pulls SNYDER After him! The driver whips the horse forward but is jerked off his SEITZ Don't worry. He's got no place to go. DAVID Why're you stoppin' -- we've got to run!
JACK	You shouldn't'a done this, David. They could put you in jail -- DAVID It's worth it -- let's go --
JACK	You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here --
DAVID	I don't understand -- JACK I don't either -- I don't understand nothin' no more! Jack pushes David down the street.
JACK	Just go! with a small serving panel in it. MY OLD FRIEND I CAN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE HIDIN' YOU'RE THE ONLY LIGHT THAT'S GUIDIN' ME TODAY Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy boiled potato. CRUTCHY Snitched it offa Snyder's plate when I was servin' him -- the biggest one! Snyder was eatin' good tonight -- the stuff we don't never get? * Patatas... olives... ... liver and bacon. Sauerkraut... Guess what I done to his sauerkraut.
JACK	So what's it git'cha?
CRUTCHY	Anudder three months, prob'ly. But you can't let 'em beat'cha, right, Jack?
JACK	We was beat when we was born. Crutchy, concerned, hears something and closes the panel. JACK Jack looks at the WILL YOU KEEP A CANDLE moonlight shining BURNIN'? through the bars... WILL YOU HELP ME FIND MY WAY? AND WHO KNOWS WHEN MY NEXT ONE WILL BE?

JACK	They got it all wrapped up, Sarah and nothin' I can do is gonna make one bit of difference.
SARAH	You're wrong. You touched people you don't even know about. She removes the stained pages from her shawl.
SARAH	Denton's story. JACK Denton looked out for hisself just like I gotta do -- so save it. SARAH Just listen!

DENTON	' -- And that is what terrifies the powers-that-be, for they know our city thrives on the shame of child labor. Therefore, Jack Kelly's voice must be stopped, whatever the cost... Damn good writing, isn't it? Jack has listened somberly, moved.
JACK	All them sweatshop kids are listenin' to me...? They think if the Newsies can do it, why can't they? All they need is a leader.
JACK	The minute I show my face, I'm back in the Refuge.
DENTON	You'd have help this time. I've been investigating the Refuge -- I know somebody who's going to be very interested in Snyder's little racket.
DAVID	What happened to the ace war correspondent? DENTON This war'll do for now.
SARAH	Whatever happens, it's Jack's decision. He's the one in danger. They look expectantly as he stares off, deep in thought. LES Jack...? You thinkin'...? JACK Yeah... I'm thinkin' of Newsie Square full of kids...
DAVID	... Another rally, right under Pulitzer's nose, and not just the Newsies -- JACK -- Every workin' kid from every sweatshop in New York. We gotta get the word out -- let's go get the Newsies -- They still think I'm a scab...
LES	I'll tell 'em you was a spy!
DENTON	How're you gonna reach all these people? No paper in New York will print anything about the strike. JACK We're Newsies, ain't we? So we make our own paper.
DAVID	Be quiet and let me think.
JACK	Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else?
LES	Advertisements! Cartoons?
DENTON	A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer. The others look discouraged; Jack's thinking again.
JACK	Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building.
JACK	So happens I know a guy with a printing press.

JONATHAN Mr. Hearst on the line, sir. Wants to know if you've read the Newsies' paper? Pulitzer glowers in suspicion at the telephone. MAYOR I'm not taking the heat for this -- you've got to talk to them -- settle it --
PULITZER	Tell Hearst I'm busy! I'll settle it all right -- once and for all.
SEITZ	It's time to talk. Like I said, I don't transact business with no office boys. We talk to old Joe hisself or we don't talk. Period.

PULITZER	All the papers have an agreement... we print nothing about the newsies. Whose press did you use? It was Hearst, wasn't it...! JACK Hearst? Nah, it was yo -- David quickly stops him, seeing the gleam in Pulitzer's
PULITZER	I knew it. Whoever helped you print this lying rag is trying to break the strike, get the jump on the rest of us. Well, you're going to expose this backstabber to the other owners -- in exchange, I'll call off the police.
JACK	Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal with our demands. Otherwise, our lips are sealed.
PULITZER	All right, all right -- just say the traitor's name. It's Hearst, isn't it? Say it! Say the name of the scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the newspaper world! Say his name, damn you!
JACK	We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.' And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends.
