CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
HICKS (CONT'D)	Since the beginning -- the two have been locked forever in combat... The vampires were quicker, stronger and had the gift of flight. Quick glimpses of a bloody, brutal battle. Men screaming.
WHOOSH!	With a HOWL, we see A MAN plucked off the ground, his body

AARON	Special project. It's taking a little more time than I thought.
SHANNON	Nothing special about milkweed. Unless you like a thorn in the finger.
I AARON	It's not Milkweed. Not this year.
SHANNON	What is it?
AARON	You'll see. His eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss -- but he's Yuck. Pershing-stew again. Their DAUGHTER (13). Already a heartbreaker. This girl is I can't do it anymore. This outpost. Being all cooped up like this. I'm going
AARON	Honey...we know this hasn't been easy for you -- In two years someone else'll study the soil and this'll be their outpost. But for right now -- this is my job. I don't know what it's like to have a best friend. To have any friends. I want to have a crush. I want secrets. I want a life. Shannon looks at her husband. She knew this day would come.
SHANNON	Aaron. She's thirteen -- She should be with children her own age. Aaron lets out a breath.
AARON	Okay. Next year, we'll figure out a way to get you to a school close by. In town.
AARON	N year -- that's still plenty of time for you to have a "crush". Lucy deflates, knowing this is as good as it's going to get

We got us a real life war-hero boysl Heard you guys were real baddasses. The Workers all pull out large knives.

Pries is holding their knives. Before they can react, he throws the knives into their feet. Scared, the leader clutches the girl, pressing against the

KOEPPEN	I caught the ambulance picking up what was left of the factory boys...figured it was your handywork. The Shape leans forward, we see it is Priest.
PRIEST	This time there was a little girl.
KOEPPEN	if this keeps occurring it'll be .impossible to keep it from the Clergy. You'll get us both excommunicated. Priest gazes into the vestibule, his voice almost a whisper.
PRIEST	I want to see the other Priests.
KOEPPEN	You know you can't. The Clergy forbids it.
PRIEST	Why?
KOEPPEN	They have their reasons. Priest flicks his eyes over Koeppen as if he could see
PRIEST	And their reasons for building more and

PRIEST	You're my friend.
KOEPPEN	I'm a wicked old man who'd sell his parish for a pint of whiskey. Priest seems to deflate, his hard shell cracking.
PRIEST	I don't know what's happening to me. (7, Questions. Doubts. I'm not sure what it is. Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face.
KOEPPEN	The devil comes in many shapes. Do yourself a favor, keep your head down. Be smart. And most of all remember your oath... He hands Priest a set of ROSARY BEADS.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)	"To go against the Church is to go against God". This statement has always been the boilerplate of Priest's The elevator arrives and they step inside. Did it hurt? The lift grinds to a stop. The mother quickly pulls her son And only now does Priest answer. Yes. The lift door clatters shut. He goes to the lone decoration in his apartment -- He takes the picture off the wall, studying it. The image From the streets below, the sound of a GUNSHOT.
PRIEST	Who is it?
MESSENGER (0. S.)	Messenger. Priest opens the door. A MESSENGER holds up a PUNCH CARD.
MESSENGER (CONY ' D)	I gota Priority Punch. Originated in the wasteland. Priest takes the card, the man writing up a receipt. L-Lucy's gone. They t-took her. I tried to stop 'em. I knowouu're..."retired". But can you find her? Find her before --. They killed Shannon. The screen goes blank. Priest shuts his eyes, making the sign of the cross.

PRIEST	Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Monsignors. Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader,
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	Father Koeppen notified us of the situation. Our prayers are with your family.
PRIEST	I come before you because I would like my authority to be reinstated.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	On what grounds? Priest is taken aback.
PRIEST	She's my blood, Monsignor.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	The proper authorities are handling the situation. I'm sure they'll.do a fine job.
PRIEST	The proper authorities?
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	All occurrences of vampire. disobedience and felonies are strictly a Federal matter now. You Priests did too good a job. The vampire population is classified as endangered. They're protected.
PRIEST	But Monsignor...they are the enemy.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	Were.the enemy. The war ended a long time ago.
PRIEST	Not so long that we should forget what they are capable of.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	You would do well to remember the words of our Savior: Turn the other cheek. Embrace your enemies. It is not our place to interfere --- or yours. Priest looks up, obviously in great turmoil.
PRIEST-	I can be of.great service to the investigation. I -can 0 The tribunal shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by Priest.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	You forget yourself, Priest... It has been brought to our attention that you have engaged in a number of transgressions. Tell me...do you feel yourself to be above God?
PRIEST	No, Monsignor.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	Engaging in any kind of practice is sacrilege -- You bring shame upon our house. Priest turns the full force of his gaze on him.
PRIEST	"Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven" -- The Monsignor POUNDS the table.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	You dare quote scripture to met Questioning the . authority. of the Clergy is forbidden1 If you engage in another transgression.you will be stripped from the Order and excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?
PRIEST	Yes, sir.'
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	I said do I make myself clear,. Father.
PRIEST	Yes, Monsignor.
MONSIGNOR ORELAS	You're a soldier. God's soldier-- Act like one. Remember your vow: "To go against the Church is to go against God". The officers start to lead Priest and Koeppen out the chamber,
MONSIGNOR ORELAS (CONT'D)	-- Eather..Kam, please stay behind for a moment, a .we have something we need to discuss.
KOEPPEN	I knew I'd find you here. He sits, pouring himself another drink, toasting the poor
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)	How many nights in this very spot? You with your endless questions on the nature of suffering-Me with none of the answers. Priest doesn't even acknowledge him, lost in his thoughts.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)	Well, now I'm the one with a question. This one's a riddle. What is greater than God-but more evil than the Devil? The poor have it, the rich need it -- and if you eat it...you'll die. Priest looks, up, his eyes cold.
PRIEST	Why won't they listen to me? A beat. Koeppen takes another drink.
KOEPPEN	Okay. I'm going to.give you one more riddle and if you listen close - you might just hear an answer to your question.
KOEPPEN (CONT'D)	How can a man who spent his whole life searching for devils miss the ones staring him in the face? From behind, a CLICKING sound. Priest turns to find an OFFICER standing, LASER-GUIDED The Church feels it's better to keep you under its care...at least until this trouble with your niece blows over..
PRIEST	You know I can't do that.
KOEPPEN	That's what I figured.
TEN TROOPERS IN FULL RIOT GEAR STORM IN	
PRIEST	Why? "To go against the Church is to go against God'. Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle There's only one thing left for him to do.

BEHIND HIM	Quietly, A COWBOY HAT and a SHOTGUN BARREL emerge from a hole
COWBOY HAT	Alright, now -- Not another step.
HICKS	Thought you'd come back for a souvenir, hub? You gotta be the dumbest bloodsucker I ever come across. Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face.
PRIEST	If I was a vampire you'd be dead already. The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing
HICKS	I'll be dammed. He casually spits some ATOMIC CHAW, hitting the floorboards TOWNSPEOPLE gather around a SNAKE-OIL SALESMAN, the man
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN	Do I ask for three dollars?' Do I ask for two dollars? No folks! ONE dollar! One piece of tin and protection is yours!
PRIEST AND HICKS	Pull up in front of the Jail. Hicks eyes the salesman,
HICKS	â¢Scuse me a minute, He heads towards the crowd, the salesman continuing his pitch.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN	Vampires are a deadly lot! YOU could be next I I seen a Blackblood bite a man like a gingersnap! The only sure way to be safe is a bag of DR. TOMLIN' S WONDER
POWDERT	If you care about your loved ones then you MUST have this amazing elixir in your homes tonight -- WHOOSH! A KNIFE slices through the air, spears the sack and
HICKS	You best get in that van and clear on out, mister.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN	For what reasons? I'm a legitimate business man. Hicks PULLS his SIX-SHOOTER, cocks it.
HICKS	I got six right here.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN	Sheriff, I am shocked you can be.so cavalier with the safety of your HAM! A bullet blows out the van's headlight.
HICKS	That's one. KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb.
HICKS (CONT'D)	Two. Immediately, the salesman quickly packs up his wares, Hicks pulls the knife from the wall, holds the bag up to the Now you all listen up. This bag ain't good fornothin' but linin' that man's pockets with your hard earned money. Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their
CROCKER	You don't know'that. You're just a kid.

HICKS	Take a look. Ain't nothin' but sand, flour and maybe 'a little garlic.. Oldest trick in the Now I don't blame you for bein' afraid. But those vampires headed clear .on out and they ain't comin' back.
WOMAN	And what about the girl? Hicks pauses. This is not easily said.
HICKS	I filed a report with the Cities last night. I'm sure they're Join' all they can. The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over
HICKS	I've already had one of the boys send for your brother. We got him put up at Paddy's place. Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are
HICKS (CONT' D)	You're gonna have to excuse the attention.. We don't get strangers `round here too much -- "Specially no Priest. 'Course we ain't never had no vampire attack in.these parts before. But then you're just here to perform the service, right? Priest doesn't reply, staring at a yellowed wanted poster.
HICKS (CONT'D)	Never much of a believer myself. I figure I got one bullet to shoot. I'm gonna shoot it my way... not how some BOOK tells me to. But I do hear things...it true what they may about you folks? You can fold time? At that, Priest turns, looking at Hicks. Before he can
AARON	comes through, looking older than the last time we saw him.
AARON	You came. Overcome, he wraps his arms around his brother, embracing.

PADDY	`Course it isl it was me Ma's recipe. As Paddy jubilantly walks away, Priest puts the bowl on the
AARON	How come you never came round more? You know you were always welcome.
PRIEST	I know.
AARON	After the war was over we figured you'd stay with us. Shannon was real fond of you. Lucy too. She was always asking about you. Uncomfortable with the conversation, Priest pulls out a map,
PRIEST	The pack headed in this direction. There's a reservation up that way so that's where I'll start.
AARON	if anyone finds out you're doing this -- You're my brother. Aaron nods. This is enough,
PRIEST (CONT' D)	I'll find her.
AARON	And you' 11 bring her back to me. Something in Priest's face darkens. He doesn't answer, not With a jingle, the door opens revealing Priest. The clerk
CLERK	Good afternoon, sir! How may I be of service?
PRIEST	I need bullets.
CLERK	How many?
PRIEST	How many do you have? The clerk laughs... then realizes he's serious.
CLERK	No offense, Father. You got a permit, right?
PRIEST	I have this. He pulls out a sack of coins, it hits the counter with a The clerk smiles wider..
AARON	Maybe if I knew how to use these she'd still be alive.
PRIEST	Sometimes things just happen. Fault's got nothing to do with it.
AARON	Funny. I'm the one who used to say that. You were the one who always said everything was God's will. Priest takes the bullet from him.
PRIEST	I'm not so sure anymore. There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's
HICKS	Aaron.
AARON	Sheriff.
HICKS	You mind if I have a word-with your brother? An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing
PRIEST (0.S.	It's alright. Let him in. Eyeing Priest, Aaron lets the Sheriff in, shutting the door
HICKS	I'm sure you're well aware of the Vampire Protection Act.
HICKS (CONT'D)	it strictly states it is forbidden for anyone to hunt vampires anymore.
C	Priest doesn't say anything, he just keeps working.

I'm supposed to arrest you on sight. He pulls a SHINY OBJECT from his pocket, puts it on the table
HICKS (CONT'D)	On the other hand -- if I go after Lucy there'll be a warrant on mybead too...and that'll put us in the same briar patch.
O	Priest looks at the object -- It's Hicks' sheriff's badae.
HICKS (CONT'D)	We leave at sun up. Priest turns. A moment as each man studies the other.
PRIEST	Why?
HICKS	We're the only chance she's got. Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched
PHHHHTTI	Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the
PRIEST	How you with a gun?
HICKS	Better than I am with a knife. Priest considers this.
PRIEST	I'll be there. Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out,
HICKS	What's with all the bullets anyway? I thought Priests don't use firearms.
PRIEST	We don't. They're for you. Hicks nods, realizing Priest was ahead of him the whole time.
PRIEST	Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven... As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and
PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. We see the TOWNSPEOPLE: lock their doors, bolting the
PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)	For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. And now the camera stops on a LARGE SHADOWY FIGURE perched on a The only thing we can see of it is a DUSTER illuminated by
AARON	You never talked much about the war but I know you saw things. Bad things.
PRIEST	Yes.
AARON	What'd you do...to make yourself unsee `em? To make it stop playing in your head?
PRIEST	I prayed.
AARON	Did it help? Priest doesn't answer, the question hanging overhead, a dark
AARON (CONT'D)	I never used to be much on faith. You But then Lucy was born. .and as soon as I saw her I knew. I Just knew -ï¿½- There's no way something so perfect came from me. She was a gift. From God. You find her. Whatever it takes. Find Lucy. Priest nods, his brother's eyes burning into him. Hearing the

I know my way `round the Wasteland better than just `bout anyone. ' Without so much as a word, Priest climbs on his cycle and Real charmer, your brother.
AARON	That's just his way. Don't pay it no mind. You just bring back my baby. Hicks nods. Then he REVS the throttle, speeding after Priest. A.

HICKS	The Nightshade Reservation.. Ain't nothin' but red-outs and rejects. They're a fallen tribe.
PRIEST	Either way. We have two hours to get in and out.
HICKS	What happens in two hours?
PRIEST	Sundown. Hicks looks up at the sky. The sun tilting towards the

HICKS	Nobody really enforces it. most come from the fringes. Drifters. They're creepy as all hell -- but harmless. They turn off their bikes and dismout. Hicks stepping A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin. His voice a hissing rasp.
FAMILIAR	Good afternoon, Sheriff... Father. What brings you to Nightshade?
HICKS	We're looking for a Vamp Pack. They woulda' came through here a couple nights ago.
FAMILIAR	Nobody comes through Nightshade. That's the way we like it. Nice and quiet.
HICKS	Then you won't mind if we have a look around? The Familiar picks up another chicken. Raises the butcher
FAMILIAR	Not at all. CHOPI The head clatters to the ground.
PRIEST	We're not going to find anything out here...We have to get into the crypts. Not supposed: to do that without a warrant -- BAMI -- Priest kicks the door in. The Crypt Familiar cowers-in the corner, shielding his eyes

HICKS	The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers two years. Even fought in the Boondock Uprising...I saw some crazy things. I just ain't never seen anything like this.
PRIEST	Killing a vampire isn't like killing a man. They come at'you like an animal. Tooth for tooth.
'PRIEST (CON'Y'' D)	Claw for claw -- Blood, skin, bones. 6 They take all of it. If you let `em. Hicks studies Priest, in the firelight he looks tired. Old
HICKS	it comes easy to you... don't it?
PRIEST	What?
HICKS	Killin'.
PRIEST	it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do with it. He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies.
PRIEST (CONT' D)	I take no pleasure in it. Killing. I know I've done more than my share -- Whatever they do to me I have it coming. You think they took her because of you... don't you? Priest stands. Cracks his neck.
PRIEST	Give me your gun.
HICKS	What?
PRIEST	Give me your gun.
HICKS	Why? You gonna shoot me now? Priest's stare is piercing. A pause then Hicks pulls his six
PRIEST	Don't anticipate the trajectory of your target. Know it. He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF
HICKS	You're teaching me to shoot?
PRIEST	I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No more wild shots --
HICKS	My ass I In case you didn't notice I was pretty damn good out there! And I sure as hell didn't see you doin' much when I had that blade buried in my arm. Must've been too busy "focusing". Priest hands the gun back to Hicks.
PRIEST	There's always-two points. A and B. Know the points and you'll know your target.
HICKS	Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bullshit.
PRIEST	I see ten crypts ...but only eight vampires. We find the missing, we'll find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town?
HICKS	Jericho. It's clear across the Plains. Gonna be a rough ride.
PRIEST	Then you better get a good night's sleep. This bunch was easy, their bloodlines watered down by man. Whoever took Lucy was a whole different breed. He tosses another body on the fire, tiny sparks floating into We hear the Banshee call of a STEAM WHISTLE, sharp and shrill
A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE	Bearing down like death itself, teeth of the behemoth's grill We only see 12im from behind. PALE ARMS reach from within the coffins, fingers touching the

SNAKE OIL SALESMAN	You told me tQ come to you if I had any information. I have some. Silently, the Figure sits down across from him.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)	But before I tell you...and I hate to bring this, up -- there is the small matter regarding compensation.
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)	Now your group's been REAL good for business so, of course, I'm willing to cut you a deal The Figure suddenly. LUNGES, grabbing the salesman by the

BLACK HAT	A Priest?
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN	He was meetin' with the local sheriff. A real shitkicker -- Booted me out of town before I could make a single sell. A pause..,.and then the Figure laughs. The salesman not sure
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)	W-What's so funny? The Figure BURIES his teeth in the man's neck, taking a deep, THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW as the Figure walks to the

LUCY	I won't tell anyone if you let me out...I promise. 10 I won't even go to the police.
BLACK HAT	You're in here for your own protection...If I let you out of this car you'll be torn apart a piece at a time. He walks to her, face still hidden in shadow. She starts to
LUCY	My uncle's a Priestl one of the best. Hooll corns after youl The Figure laughs. Bending down to her level --
BLACK HAT	I'm absolutely counting on it. And now we get our first look at her captor. A cross tattoo The mark of the Priest. WE WATCH as the sun crests the horizon and rises quickly
THE PLAINS	They sit parked on a bluff, the emptiness making Hick's eyes
HICKS	Walkin' Pete talked about this place -- said it. used to be really somethin'. Everythin' growin' green as a goddamn dollar bill. 'Course we had to go and screw it up by poisonin' everythin' -- nothin' pretty survives this world ...nothin' decent anyways. Just wish I could'a seen it. Priest pulls out a canteen of water, takes a sip. Hands it
PRIEST	How's your arm?
HICKS	Sore. Cut's still open. As Hicks hands the canteen back, Priest suddenly grabs his arm
PRIEST	You're a halfbreed. A BEAT as Hicks looks to the ground, when he speaks, it's in
HICKS	My grandmother... she was raped. Nobody knows -- It's recessive in my family. No bloodthirst. No light sensitivity. I'm not proud... but it's a part of me. Ain't nothin' I can do. I woulda told you...just didn't want you treatin' me no different. It hangs there. the'silence stretching like a rope,then A. Priest inspects a TIRE TREAD in the sand, a cluster of C. Hicks pulls a TORN PIECE OF CLOTHING (LUCY'SDRESS?)
A TIN STRUCTURE	Must be a mirage. Hicks blinks, can't believe his eyes. It
HICKS	Gotta be a desert rat. They park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety
HICKS (CONT'D)	Let me do the talkin'. The sun has a way of cookin' these people's brains so they ain't quite right - BANG! A rifle shot kicks up dust at Hicks' feet.
VOICE (0.3.)	Hold it right there, mistert Hicks freezes. A BEAT as. the front of the shack shows only a doorway hidden
OLD MAN	Take another step and you'll be meetin' the Lord directly.
HICKS	Easy now old timer. I'm a sheriff. The old man snorts, spitting a thick stream of tobacco,. it
OLD MAN	Ain't no law out here but my own. Calm and cool, Priest shifts in his seat, drawing his gaze.
THE MAN'S EYES WIDEN	Seeing Priest clearly now for the first time.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)	Praise The Lord. Total attitude adjustment. He lowers the Rifle and smiles --
OLD MAN	Cleaned the place up a bit. Been years since I had any kind of company 'sides jackrabbits but I knew you was comity' -- Dreams don't lie.' Ignoring Hicks, the old man pours BLACK TEA into a rusty can, Most people don't remember what you folk done -- Don' t WANT to remember. But I do. I know what you can do. You are God's mighty sword fused into flesh. One of the chosen.. Touched by His very ha nd so peace could finally come to this cur sed land. Hicks snorts.
HICKS	Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo jumbo to me. The old man stares fixedly at Priest.
OLD MAN	Now you tell the Clergy this here is an authentic miracle, I want it registered. It's mine.
PRIEST	Miracle?
OLD MAN	The Angels. Never seen so many loot souls, breaks my heart just to think of it. This ain't no place for nothin' divine. The man's fevered belief unsettles Priest, he's unsure how to
PRIEST	You saw angels?
OLD MAN	Sure as chit.
PRIEST	How many?
OLD MAN	Don't know, too many to count. Hundreds. Thousands. Some nights the sky was so thick you couldn't see the stars. His eyes suddenly light up, remembering something. Here! Look at this -- He goes to a shelf, it's been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE -- He pulls out a GLASS JAR containing SOMETHING MISSHAPEN
HICKS	What is it?
OLD MAN	It's their spoor! They'd be flyin' above and this stuff would drop from the sky like manna.
HICKS	That's angel shit?
OLD MAN	Scooped it up myself. You wanna hold it? Hicks backs away, shaking his head.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)	Suit yourself. Priest still doesn't know what to make of the man but he
PRIEST	These angels...di.d you ever see them during the day?
OLD MAN	No, I reckon'. that's when they'd go back home for some shut eye -- Gettin' the world ready for the rapture takes a lot of work. Praise God.
PRIEST	Home?
OLD MAN	The castle - .:,He:points out the window, far away, atop a craggy peak sits
OLD MAN (CONT'D)	Beautiful place. Wonder of the world. I used to watch `em every night, takin' to the sky in all of God's glory, I never would disturb `em though. God's children like their privacy. He winks, smiling that crazy smile. Priest considers the
OLD MAN	Wait! I want you to have somethin' before you go He presses a HOMEMADE CROSS into Priest's hand. It's a real
OLD MAN (CONT' D)	Remember, a man comes into this world with one thing. His soul. He's lucky if he's still got it when he leaves. Priest pockets the cross, REVVING his cycle and with a final Lucy smiles sweetly, taking the tray.
LUCY	Thank you. The Familiar turns to leave. WHAPI Lucy SLAMS the tray over his head and he collapses to She makes a run for it. But the Familiar manages to grab her Two more FAMILIARS run in and grab her arms, wrestling her to Priest and Hicks stand, surveying the ancient ruin. Hicks Yep. Truly a wonder of the world...good thing we listened to the fossil. Don't know how we'd find Lucy without him.
PRIEST	Vampires sometimes use abandoned structures as a perch. Watch for booby traps. And with that he enters the--
HICKS	Why we listen' to that crackpot? Crazy fucker's so blinded by faith he's batahit. That's called a zealot in my. book. I'm startin' to think you might be one yourself. You ever think bout that? Priest doesn't respond, squinting his eyes.
HICKS	This is bullshit. Lucy's been gone five days'-- every stupid minute we waste here is a minute more she gets farther-away.
PRIEST	Stay here. If anything comes up the steps that isn't me -- Shoot it. Before Hicks can reply,.Priest heads down the stairs, darkness
HICKS	Great.
DOWN THE STAIRS	The air seems thicker here, the darkness claustrophobic.

PRIESTESS	How did you find me? Priest doesn't reply. She narrows her eyes, suspicious.
PRIESTESS (CONT'D)	Did the Clergy send you?
PRIEST	No. Why would they? She nods towards the bodies, we now see tb=1re.-VAMPIRZ-
PRIESTESS	I've been busy.
HICKS	Shit. He wipes the blood on his pants, not noticing as a A LARGE
PRIESTESS	If you didn't come for me...why are you here?
PRIEST	I should be asking you the same question. The bestial smell stings their nostrils, smells good.
PRIESTESS	There's another one around here somewhere.
PRIEST	Where?
PRIESTESS	I don't know...but it's not like the others. They're interrupted by the sound of GUNFIRE echoing off the
PRIEST	Hicks. He starts down the tunnel. The Priestess quickly following. SOMETHING is lurking. A hulking shadow, sounds like a rabid
PRIEST	It's too big to fit down here. That's why you're still alive.
HICKS	What the hell is that thing?I
HICKS	I'm not stupid. Vampires don't look like that.
PRIESTESS (0.8.)	They used to. The Priestess steps out from behind Priest. Startling Hicks.

ATOP THE CASTLE WALL	Priest and the Priestess stare out at the Wasteland,
PRIEST	This was a Pureblood.
PRIESTESS	we both know that's impossible -- They haven't existed for a millennium. What's going on here?
PRIEST	.I don't know. A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess
PRIESTESS	Sector Seven was the only place I could find work. Waste Management. Nobody else would hire me. %No applicable skills.&
PRIEST	I heard that one too.
PRIESTESS	A week ago, a family camping out on the Perimeter approached me --.Told me vampires were terrorizing their village and that the government wouldn't do anything about it.
PRIEST	Did you go to The Clergy?
PRIESTESS	They wouldn't see me, By the time I got to the village it was completely razed. Nothing left. Women. Children. All dead ...they didn't even bother to feed. I've been on their trail ever since...could be the same group who took your niece.
PRIEST	Could be. The Priestess glances towards Hicks.
PRIESTESS	Does the lawman know what you'll do if you find her?
PRIEST	He knows.
PRIESTESS	He'll try to stop you.
PRIEST	He won't be able to. She pauses a moment, regarding him.
PRIESTESS	You know, some nights I still dream we're back on the frontlines ... I wake up, I'm sweating... my muscles all clenched like I'm ready for something -- But I don't know what.
PRIEST	Me too.
PRIESTESS	Nights like that ...I don't go back to sleep. But on other nights ...the good nights I dream about other things.
PRIEST	..Like what?
PRIESTESS	You. Priest stares at her, not sure what to say. Lucky for him,
HICKS	- Hey.you guys better get a look at thisl The warriors lock eyes, knowing something's been started -- They head down the stone steps. Hicks is lifting up one of the creature's wings. There's
PRIESTESS	it must be a birthmark of some kind.
HICKS	That ain't no birthmark -- it's a brand. The Priestess studies the mark, something about it making her
PRIESTESS	There's something else you need to see...
PRIESTESS	I found this just before I was attacked -
AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER	Huge. Cavernous. Our group appearing as tiny shapes set
PRIEST	It's a tomb. Big enough for an army.
HICKS	Guess they're not as endangered as everyone thought. 0 But where'd they go?. We hear a LOUD SHRIEK - and a MASSIVE SWARM OF BATS sweep
PRIEST	Only one way to find out...
HICKS	Are Priests allowed to, you know...have relations?
PRIESTESS	We take a vow of celibacy at inception. Hicks can't be sure -- did she just look at Priest when she
HICKS	Look...I was uh, wondering --. how did he do that little stunt back there?
PRIESTESS	All Priests can do it.
HICKS	Including you? She nods.
HICKS (CONT'D)	So what's the trick?
PRIESTESS	No trick. You just have to remember.
HICKS	Remember... what?
PRIESTESS	Time is relative. Priest snaps up his hand, cutting off their conversation,
HUGE CHAMBER	Not like the cave, this is more earthen. Like the inside of a
A GIANT SHADOW	Looms before him, we_don't see what it is.
PRIEST	You said the next nearest town was Jericho.
HICKS	Yeah.
PRIEST	Then we better go see.
HICKS	. See what?

PRIESTESS	Be careful. Just because it's daylight doesn't mean it's safe. Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest. DUST BLOWN IN FROM THE STORM COVERS EVERYTHING, broken
HICKS	'Damn. He shakes his head, heading towards the holding area as -- if the jail was a disaster zone, this place is just plain
MUSIC SUDDENLY BURSTS FROM THE PIANO	The plinking keys playing by themselves, activated by It's obvious a FAMILY lived here, children's clothes and

The only evidence B. The corpses now wrapped in white cloth, carefully placed C. Flames engulfing the bodies, a twisty column of smoke
HICKS	Don't make no sense. What were they doin' out here?
PRIESTESS	The same thing as us. Someone's drawing us out.
HICKS	Who? The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea.
HICKS (CONT'D)	I imagine you'll have to go back to the Cities, inform the Clergy. A sudden silence.
PRIEST	We're not going back. The Priestess looks at him, he speaks for her as well but
PRIESTESS	We'll burn for this.
PRIEST	We already are. Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the
HICKS	It's a railroad spike. My pop used to work boxcars before they shut down -- Why the hell would anyone wanna swallow that? A beat as Priest puts it together.
PRIEST	He wanted us to find it. It's a clue.
PRIESTESS	Where's the closest track?
HICKS	The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way in the backcountry, bought the ore from the deep mines. There were about five stops along the route. I think. He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a

PRIEST	Where? He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.
HICKS	So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.
PRIESTESS	They must have been picking up different factions along the way. Moving during the day, feeding at night.
HICKS	But headin' to the Cities is suicide. The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere to hide. Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled.
PRIEST	They won't have to.
THE CAMERA	Overtakes the train. Snaking along the rail at an incredible And it is only now that we see exactly what Priest means. A BLACK COWBOY HAT coolly tilted down, exposing .a cheroot
DARK FIGEMH	A fine catch yes? She'd be dead if not for me...swallowed by the wasteland. We see Lucy on the floor at the Figure's feet, his pale hand From the shadows, Black Hat steps forward, looking down at
BLACK HAT	What do you want for her? And now her captor lifts his hat -- revealing paper-thin
RUNE	You know what r want. Black Hat's eyes flick upwards, glinting in the. candlelight.
BLACK HAT	Don't. go too far, Rune.
RUNE	He comes for her still.
BLACK HAT	Of course he does.
RUNE	Let me have him.
BLACK HAT	No. Rune smiles,'revealing an impressive set of vampire fangs.
RUNE'	I'm sure she'll fetch a nice price out In the zone -- they don't care what condition their meat's in...as long as it's easy to chew. Black Hat eyes him.
BLACK HAT	Don't get involved in this.
RUNE	I was involved long before you showed up. I've been waiting years for a chance at him...and now that he's here I find x have to ask a Prime permission... Like a snake, a finger of the claw emerges from the folds of

RUNE (CONT'D)	I never cared about your war. Never got Involved. Us halfbreeds. We were exiles -- rejected by both humans and vampires. All we wanted was a quiet place. But he wiped out my whole tribe. Maybe it's time to return the favor. The metal finger wraps TIGHTEtR, Lucy gasps, the "tension

Twilight.	Hicks and the two Priests ride past tumbleweed drifts, the
HICKS	Beggar's Pass...it ain't gonna be easy. As if on cue the last rays of the sun wink out behind the Headlight crossbeams leading the way, their cycles navigate Priest lies close by, asleep.
HICKS	If we push it hard we'll gain two days on 'em. Should be enough to get us a jump.
PRIESTESS	We'need more than a jump. We need a miracle.
HICKS	That's the funny thing about time -- He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the It's always runin' right through my fingers.
PRIESTESS	You should try harder, sheriff. She cups her hand in the water, bringing it to her lips for a
HICKS	You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest?
PRIESTESS	No.
HICKS	What about a husband, children...A family?
PRIESTESS	I've had a family -- just not the kind you're familiar with. Hicks glances at Priest.
HICKS	What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there?
PRIESTESS	He's not so bad once you get to know him. A beat, Hick's expression becoming serious.
HICKS	He's going to kill her, isn't he? If. she's turned.
PRIESTESS	Yes.
HICKS	There's things that can be done. She doesn't have to die.
PRIESTESS	She's his bloodline... and he's a Priest. It's the only way. Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire, troubled, further... for now.
HICKS	And how many of you Priests are left now? A long moment before she speaks.
PRIESTESS	Two. Hicks doesn't know what to Say-,,
HICKS	.I'm sorry.,
PRIESTESS	Yes. She nods, though in affirmation of what Hicks's isn't sure. A GROUP OF PRIESTS (OUR TWO amongst them) move silently
THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS	stretching endlessly, rising high above in a cone. THOUSANDS OUR PRIEST, motions with his hand to the others, giving

FEARSOME SUDDENLY STOPS	A BLACK TOP HAT lying on the ground catching his eye, must be The Priestess races by, shooting him a we don't have time What do you think -- Am I a "Dapper Dan"? She glares, running ahead to join the group. Fearsome just
FEARSOME PRIEST (CONT'D)	Guess not. From within the hive comes a MIGHTY SHRIEK -- and now At the last second -- He's pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS. The
PRIESTESS	Why would the Clergy forbid us from seeing each other?
PRIEST	Maybe they were scared of what we could do.
PRIESTESS	Or what we would do. We both know there's something inside the Order that's off. Even if we don't know what it is.
PRIEST	With or without the Clergy...we're still Priests. And we're the only ones who can stop that train.
PRIESTESS	If we survive this we need to expose them for what they are. We won' t survive this. She puts down her tools, staring fixedly at him.
PRIESTESS	You scared to die?_
PRIEST	No.
PRIESTESS	I believed in Heaven my whole life. Believed everything we were taught -- And now...when it's finally my time...no more faith. They took it away from me. Priest gazes at her, trying his best to be comforting.
PRIEST	Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go. We'll go together. At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a
PRIEST (CONT'D)	What in greater than God but more evil than the Devil? The poor have it, the rich need it -- and if you eat it...you'lldie.
PRIESTESS	What?
PRIEST	It's a riddle. The Priestess thinks about it.
PRIESTESS.	Nothing. That's the answer. Nothing is greater than God. Nothing is more evil than the devil. The poor have nothing, the rich need nothing. And if you eat nothing... you'll die. It's said that warriors can become close friends only when they What you said before...about those nights when you were dreaming of me --
PRIESTESS	The good nights.
PRIEST	Yes. The good nights. Do you think maybe tonight...
PRIESTESS	Could be one of those nights? She smiles. And then Priest does the most amazing thing. . .he smiles back. And it is here, together in this place, where they feel like The last two. As our trio forges onward and upward, the trail more

HICKS	I- ee itl Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain.
IN THE DISTANCE	A long black line snakes along the rail, puffs of heavy smoke They're ahead of it. Barely. In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent But he's gone.
PRIEST	I know you're there. A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something
A GROUP OF ROCKS	Tumble down the cliff. Again Priest abruptly turns
PRIEST (CONT'D)	Show yourself. A BEAT as he stands in the ether, waiting. Then -- onen. ieadjna straight-for pi=. Just in time -- he DIVES, the claw BITING into a rock behind

PRIEST	This isn't the time to settle old scores, Rune.
RUNE (0. S. )	I disagree... This is the perfer, time. WOOSH! Like lightning, the claw LASHES out, appearing from. You've lost a step Priest...I never came this close before.
PRIEST	I'm older now. We can almost bear Rune smile.
RUNE (0.8.)	Not me. And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction, WRAPPING Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's Rune leaps away, landing ontop a boulder.
RUNE (CONT'D)	You can't outrun the past, Priest... the things you did.
PRIEST	It was a war, Rune.
RUNE	It still is He launches at Priest, duster fluttering like wings. The two
THE PRIESTESS	Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound. Rune looks over, sees --
HICKS	Six-shooter pointed right at him. A beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff. The Another time, Priest. He skitters up the rock face, disappearing into the mist.
HAM!	Hicks fires a single shot, the echo ringing through the canyon.
RUNE'S BODY	Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead.
HICKS	Tell me you won't kill her. Priest doesn't reply. Tell me...or I'll shoot you where you stand.
PRIEST	Finally showing your true colors. A beat. The Priestess looks at Hicks.
PRIESTESS	What's he talking about?
PRIEST	He's a halfbreed. Hicks cocks the gun.
HICKS	Don't turn this into somethin' it's not.
PRIEST	You've been itching to do this since Nightshade.
HICKS	She's your kin, goddamit!
PRIEST	if she's turned...she's nobody's kin.
