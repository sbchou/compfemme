Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan. Do you know what the penalty is for stealing? (whispering) What are you doing? (whispering back) Just play along. You know this girl? Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She's a little She said she knows the Sultan! She thinks the monkey is the Sultan. Tragic, isn't it? (He leans forward, picking foot.) But, no harm done. (Walks over to Jasmine.) Now come along sis. Time to see the doctor. (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor. No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose Yes, o mighty evil one.

(He takes a bite from the apple in his Why you! Abu says that--uh--that's not fair. What? Oh did he? Yeah, of course. And does Abu have anything else to say? Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help. Oh, boy! Hmm, tell him that's very sweet. and JASMINE: They've found me! (To each other) They're My father must have sent them-- Do you trust me? What? Then jump! Hey, get off of me! Let go of him.

Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer Abu, will ya knock it off? over and wraps around the pair.) Hey, whoa! You see, we're trying to find this lamp. (CARPET motions for them to follow it.) I think he knows where it is. Oh. Huh? Uh oh! VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure. (ABU and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you will never again see the light of day! MAN: Throw me the lamp! I can't hold on. Give me your hand. MAN: First give me the lamp! MAN: Giving you your reward.

(Sticks the mic in ALADDIN's face.) What's your name? Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin. (Says his name as if he's discovered something ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights. The Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?' Or how bout 'Laddi?' (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy!

(Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos? You powerful genie--can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even get us out of this cave. Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here-- me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did you bring me here? And all of a sudden, you're walkin' out on me?

Now about my three wishes- Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own. Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be What? No, tell me. Freedom. You're a prisoner? It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig. Itty bitty living space Genie, that's terrible. (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free. Not have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?" To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about, here? Let's get real here. It's not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus Why not? The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out. So you can guess how often that's happened.

Got it? Okay. C'mon Aladdin!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and scope! (He babbles in something that sounds like German. On the surface, a giant water spout emerges, and lands on top of the cliff. ALADDIN Don't you scare me like that! Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say Oh, Al. I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid. Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything. Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I'm so happy. (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you. What? (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.) You will I will never marry you. (She goes to the SULTAN) Prince Ali left! What? (He goes to the SULTAN) Ridiculous Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with What? Jafar? You, you traitor!

Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is a picture of himself and JAFAR) and how about this picture? I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Why that miserable-- But you are going to relieve him of it! Me? the heart of the princess. What are you gonna do Psst, your line is "I'm going to free the genie." Anytime. Genie...I can't. Sure you can. You just go "Genie, I wish you Prince Ali sultan. Without you, I'm just Aladdin. Al, you won! Because of you! The only reason anyone thinks I'm I'm not really a prince? (Quietly) What if Jasmine finds out? I'll lose her. Genie, I can't keep this up on my own. I can't wish you free. (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else. Hey, I was beginning to feel left out. Now, if you'll excuse me, master. (He says the last word in disgust, then Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the a pillow on top of the LAMP.) Then just stay in there! (He looks at ABU and CARPET.) What are you wait, c'mon. (He sighs.) What am I doing? Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth. (From a distance) Ali, oh Ali--will you come here? Ya got a problem, pinky? (He sweeps the bird's of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah, Jafar--you're too kind. I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing. (He flies away with the lamp.) Ali, where have you been? There's something I've got to tell you. The whole kingdom has turned out for father's No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please! ...Ali Ababwa! Oh, boy! descends and consults a playbill.) Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man. I was afraid of that. Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to rule on Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on? Jafar, you vile betrayer. That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you. Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just see about that! (Pulls Sorry, kid--I got a new master now. (He places the Jafar, I order you to stop! There's a new order now--my order! Finally, you will bow to me! Why am I not surprised? If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will second wish--I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world! Now where were we? Ah, yes--abject humiliation! with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. (off-camera) Jafar! Get your hands off her! Yes, it is he, But not as you know him. Read my lips and come to grips With reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past	Whose lies were too good to last Say hello to your precious Prince Ali! Jasmine, I tried to tell you. Just a con, need I go on?

So long, Good bye, see ya! Ex-Prince Ali! freed the genie when I had the chance. (He digs out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.) Abu! Are you okay? I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of everything, somehow. I gotta go back and set things right. (He starts to walk through the snow, can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! That's it! (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and them up.) Now, back to Agrabah! Let's go! lots! on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
