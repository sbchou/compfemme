DEAN	Thanks. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 37. Coming!
CURTIS (V.O.)	Yeah. I can tell what's happening already. You see this person... you think it's love at first sight, and the course of your life will be forever changed. Maybe... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 38. It's like when two streams are flowin' down opposite sides of the mountain, mindin' their business.
CURTIS (V.O.)	They're doin' fine until they hit the bottom and run into one another...
CURTIS (V.O.)	At that point they got no choice but to become one river.
CURTIS (V.O.)	Sure, it's a great feeling at first, all this new water flowing together. But then you travel down a little ways and the land levels out. The current starts moving a little slower.
CURTIS (V.O. CONT'D)	People start drinking the water. Pissin' in it. Putting up dams to stop the flow.
CURTIS (V.O. CONT)	In other words, life interferes, you know. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 38A. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 39.
BOBBY	Hasn't anyone ever been nice to you? Don't make me give up on you...
CURTIS(V.O.)	And there's not too many of these rivers that'll make it all the way to the ocean without splitting off eventually. It's just nature, that's all. And instead of thinking about it you gotta just do something about it. Action, not thought.
DEAN	Anyone call for me?
DEAN (V.O.)	I just keep replaying it in my head. Thinking about other things I coulda done. Other things I coulda said.
DEAN (V.O.)	You wait your whole life for something to happen... Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 39A. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 40. ...And you have all these ideas in your head about how you'll act and what you'll say and what you'll do, who you'll be...
DEAN (V.O.) cont'd	...And then the opportunity comes, it presents itself to you, living and breathing in the flesh, and you puss out.
DEAN	Hi. I was looking for your neighbor... the man who moved in last month. Across the hall. Do you know what happened to him? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 41.

CINDY	She was pretty too..
DEAN	She must have been crazy.
CINDY	Why do you say that?

CINDY	Absolutely. We don't have to get in each other's way.
DEAN	And that's the way you like it, don't you? You don't like me to bother you.
CINDY	I didn't say that. What I meant is that it's important for us to have our space. That's all. We're grown people.
DEAN	Well there's not much space here. So I guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya?
CINDY	You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab.
DEAN	If you're not interested in hearing what I think I just won't say anything.
CINDY	Good luck. I just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 51.
DEAN	OK. I'm going to say something. And what I'm about to say I've thought long and hard about. I'm the luckiest person alive because I'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it.
CINDY	I think my glass has a hole in it.
DEAN	What's wrong with that?
CINDY	It's fat.
DEAN	That's the flavor. Eat it.

CINDY	What?
DEAN	Not being retarded.
DEAN (CONT'D)	Hey...that's not funny? How come you don't think I'm funny any more? I tell you something funny. You laugh. I see you laugh. But you don't really laugh so much. You don't laugh anymore Cindy.
CINDY	Dean... Come on, it's time for bed.
DEAN	No I want to make you laugh.
DEAN (CONT'D)	Hello...
CINDY	You're drunk. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 56.

DEAN (CONT'D)	Do you... you want to have another baby? ... I want another child.
CINDY	No... Dean... Wait a second.
DEAN	What!? I can't have sex with my wife!?
DEAN (CONT'D)	Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a little affection. Do you want me to stop loving you? Do you want me to fuck other women? Do you want me to beat you?
CINDY	Stop... stop... stop...
DEAN	Is that what you think you deserve? Would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this? Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 57.
