CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
ADAM	Help! Someone help me! (He stops when he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere in the room. He looks out into the darkness and calls out.) Is someone there? Hey! he is chained, says in a slightly softer but still panicked voice) Shit, Im probably dead.
LAWRENCE	Youre not dead.
ADAM	Whos that? Whos that?!
LAWRENCE	side, and almost irritated with Adams reaction to the situation. This shall Theres no point in yelling, I already tried it.
ADAM	Turn on the lights!
LAWRENCE	Would if I could.
ADAM	What the fuck is going on? Where am I? (He turns into his corner, touching
LAWRENCE	I dont know yet.
ADAM	is that smell?
LAWRENCE	Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found something.
ADAM	Holy shit!
ADAM	his bottom on the floor as he yanks at the chain as hard as he can.) HELP!!! Help!
LAWRENCE	No one can hear you.
ADAM	What the fuck is this?
LAWRENCE	Calm down, just calm down. (He knows that to remain calm is to remain in control, something he must be no matter what the situation.) Are you hurt?
ADAM	I dont know...yeah!
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	Confused! (demanding) Whats your name? Whats going on here?
LAWRENCE	My name is Lawrence Gordon, Im a doctor. I just woke up here, just like you.
ADAM	(in pain) Ah!
LAWRENCE	Recognize him?
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	kid) Well, do you have any idea how you got here?
ADAM	No.
LAWRENCE	Whats the last thing you remember?
ADAM	Nothing. (he sits back onto the floor, I went to bed in my shithole apartment, and woke up in an actual shithole. (He raises his left leg slightly, starts trying to pull his foot out of the iron cuff. He glances to Lawrence, who has moved over to the wall to his left, bent over slightly and resting a hand against a pipe.) So what about you, huh?
LAWRENCE	Well theres...theres not much to tell, really. (Across the room, Adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor.) I was on my way home from work and uh, I dont remember anything else.
ADAM	First dead body Ive ever seen. Look different in real life. They dont move.
LAWRENCE	From the looks of these chains, someone didnt want us to go very far either.
ADAM	Can you see any scars?
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	Huh? This is what they do man, (he gestures to his stomach, where there are in fact no scars.) They kidnap you and drug you and before you know it, youre in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay.
LAWRENCE	has taken your kidneys.
ADAM	over there?
LAWRENCE	be in terrible agony, or youd be dead by now. Trust me.
ADAM	What are you, a surgeon? (He lowers his shirt and turns and bends down to
LAWRENCE	So, you gonna tell me your name, or what?
ADAM	Adam.
LAWRENCE	against the pipe to his right. Adam watches him, scared but calm) is start thinking about why were here. Whoever brought us there couldve killed us by now. But they didnt. They must want something from us. (He looks up and around the room) Question is what. (He sees something up on the wall, moves forwards a bit towards it. We see that it is a brand new clock on the wall, ticking away. It reads currently at 10:22.) That clock.
ADAM	What about it?
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	(not getting what hes implying) So?
LAWRENCE	Adam see it?) So, someone obviously wanted us to know the time. (Adam looks a bit confused still, mulls over that Wait, I think I may be able to reach that door.
LAWRENCE	What is that? (Adam doesnt answer, continues looking at the tape. Lawrences voice grows impatient.) Excuse me.
ADAM	back down at the tape. His voice sounds slightly surprised.) Its a tape.
LAWRENCE	Where did you find it?
ADAM	It was in my pocket.
ADAM	(regarding his tape) It says Play me.
LAWRENCE	to the key) Come on, come on, come on....
ADAM	on Lawrences lock) Throw it over here.
ADAM	Fuck. (He leans over and picks up the key, then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt work. He tries the lock on the chains around the pipe. It isnt working there
LAWRENCE	(watching him) No?
LAWRENCE	Use your shirt.
ADAM	(gets back up to his knees) What?
LAWRENCE	Your shirt.
LAWRENCE	Come on...
ADAM	It wont work.
LAWRENCE	Well, look around, there must be something else you can use.
ADAM	Theres nothing.
LAWRENCE	(insistent) Well there must be something!
LAWRENCE	Come on, you can do it.
LAWRENCE	Come on, come on, again.
JIGSAW	(on tape) Rise and shine, Adam. Youre probably wondering where you are. Ill tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. But what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? Now, I see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. So are you going to watch yourself die today, Adam? Or do something about it?
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	tape.
LAWRENCE	slow-minded fool who simply doesnt understand the full capacity of the situation that theyre in, and speaks to him as such.) Look, were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. Now just throw it to me.
ADAM	Im not going to risk breaking it! You throw me your tape!
JIGSAW	up call. Every day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are going to die soon. Now you will be the cause of death. Your aim in this game is to kill Adam. (Adam glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, then back up at Lawrence) You have until six on the clock to do it. There sa man in the room with you. When theres that much poison in your blood (another view of the body from Lawrences POV), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself. this hidden all around you. Just remember: X marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot. Let the game begin. (end)
LAWRENCE	him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, plays back. Adam stands up from his
JIGSAW	die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot.
ADAM	Any idea who that is?
JIGSAW	(on tape) Let the game begin.
ADAM	He knows us.
LAWRENCE	Wait a minute. (rewinds more)
ADAM	a joke, right?
LAWRENCE	
JIGSAW	(on tape) Let the game begin.
LAWRENCE	
JIGSAW	a brief silence)...Follow your heart. What the hell does Follow your heart mean?
LAWRENCE	There! Right next to you, on the toilet.
LAWRENCE	on.
ADAM	Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, his face turned away from the bowl. He coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back, trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting.
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	Take off the lid. (He points to the lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no patience.) Come on!
ADAM	I really wish I had checked in there first.
LAWRENCE	Huh. (he smiles slightly) What is it?
LAWRENCE	Hey! (Adam turns and looks. Lawrence speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing me the other one?
ADAM	(enraged) Fuck! Fuck! (He reacts violently, hitting the broken saw twice against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room, right into a mirror. A small piece of the mirror breaks off
LAWRENCE	He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. (Adam looks up at him, eyebrows raised.) I think I may know whos done this to us.
ADAM	What did you say? (he stands up; is
LAWRENCE	Its not someone I know personally. Its...just someone I know of.
ADAM	Christ! Tell me, who is it?!
LAWRENCE	The last I heard...the police still hadnt caught him.
LAWRENCE	(VO) And the only reason I know that is because I was a suspect.
LAWRENCE	
KERRY	This ones not fresh anymore. At least three weeks out. (Detective Tapp squints Victims a 46-year old male. (Quick flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup of behind the mans head and upper back. There are deep cuts all over. The camera cuts upwards to the detectives.) Died of massive blood loss. Mostly through the femoral artery. (The camera pans around to Detective Tapp, who moves around the side fo the cage to get a better look inside, shining his flashlight in.) He started at the back of the cage and tunneled his way through the razor wire so fast its amazing he got as far as he did. Cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor. (Another more gruesome crime scene photo shot of the body from the side; we can see the razor wire digging in under his arm. Also, a close-up shot We also found this. (She holds up an evidence baggie with a micro cassette tape recorder, just like the one Adam and Lawrence found in their cell. She presses the play button, and Tapp and Sing listen. Its the same chilling
JIGSAW	(on tape) Hello Paul. You are a perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male. Yet last month, you ran a straight razor across your wrists. Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die, or did you just want some attention? Tonight, youll show me. The irony is that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are. But if you want to live, youll have to cut yourself again. (Flashback shot of Paul waking up in the cage, looking around, scared and confused. The shots go back and forth between the detectives and the Paul flashback, with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire, screaming. His screams sound distant under Jigsaws voice.) Find the path through the razor wire to the door. But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb. How much blood will you shed to stay
KERRY	a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.
TAPP	Jigsaw piece. (Sing looks in as well, see it. There is a quick flash of crime scene photos showing a close up of the wound. Tapp sighs.) I think were gonna be here for a while, Sing. (Sing looks to him. We get another quick crime scene
LAWRENCE	him the Jigsaw Killer.
LAWRENCE	Actually, technically speaking, hes not really a murderer. He never killed anyone.
LAWRENCE	kill themselves.
JIGSAW	(VO, on tape) Hello Mark. If youre so sick, then why do I have so many photos of you up and about? (there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of Mark up and about, looking around and getting into a car.) Lets put your so-called illness to the test. (Flashback image of Mark waking up. He is a younger man in his mid to late twenties, with dark brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. In front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some chains. On the plate is a micro cassette player, a lit votive candle, and a box of matches. He gets up, looking around confusedly and scared.) Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is in the safe. (Black and white crime scene shot of the safe, then a shot of Mark standing over it, screaming, his screams distant under Jigsaws voice, as with Paul.) The combination to the safe (quick montage of several black and white crime-scene photos of numbers written all over the walls) is written on the wall. Hurry up and program it in. But watch your step (Marks bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor). And by the way, thats a flammable substance smeared on your body (shot of Mark looking at the ointment on his hand, up his arm, everywhere), so I would be careful with that candle, if I were you...
MARK	it is still distant sounding) Help!!!!!
JIGSAW	(VO ctd)....or all the people youve burned with your act (Mark starts to turn the lock on the safe) just might have their revenge.
KERRY	I found something else. Well, two things, actually. (She moves past them and we go with her over to a wall where there is a small hole cut, about an inch or two in diameter. The light from the outside shines in.) There was someone standing outside here watching through Jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his own sick little games. He was there at the last one as well. (She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only this time, he left us his penlight.
TAPP	
KERRY	room) Copy that. Hospital room. Lawrence in his white doctors coat along with three blue-scrub clad medical students. A nurse in white stands off to the side. Lawrence is going over the patients charts. He goes over to the x-ray display, pushing the light on to view two x-rays of someones skull. He points to it with his pen as he speaks.
LAWRENCE	Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline. Started as colon cancer. students. One of them, a pretty Asian girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated with him.) The patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining.
LAWRENCE	The patient had...
ZEP	(cutting him off) His name is John, Dr. Gordon. (He looks down at the patient, who we see is a man in his late forties-early fifties, hairless except for a small white goatee. His head is to the side and he is sleeping. On the tray table in front of him is a notebook and some colored pencils. As Zep looks at him and speaks of him, there is caring in his voice, something Dr. Gordon has Hes a very interesting person.
LAWRENCE	Thank you for that information, Zep. his smug smile) As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients. (Zep just stares at Lawrence, his expression mostly blank but with pure loathing just underneath the surface. The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, then turns away, and continues down the hall with his cart.) Continuing on, the patient....
INTERCOM	Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please page the operator.
LAWRENCE	someone doesnt want me to tell you what the patient has. Excuse me. (He steps around the students, leaves the room. The three students watch after
TAPP	Dr. Gordon, Im Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing, City Homicide. (he Very impressive.
LAWRENCE	Oh. Thank you, I do my best. (He sits in his chair. Tapp takes the seat next to Sing across from him. Sing studies
TAPP	Sorry to interrupt you while youre working.
LAWRENCE	Thats fine. Now, how can I help you gentlemen?
TAPP	Are you able to tell us where you were between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor?
LAWRENCE	Why is it that youre interested?
TAPP	Wed like to ask you a few questions about it. For your sake, I think its best if we do it down at the station. Would you like to follow us there?
LAWRENCE	No, Im afraid thats...thats quite out of the question. I cant just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today, so...
SING	Oh, thats okay, you can ride with us. Doc.
LAWRENCE	youll have to tell me again. What is this all about?
TAPP	Is this yours, Doctor?
LAWYER	So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene?
LAWRENCE	Of course not!
LAWYER	I have to ask. What were you doing last night.
LAWRENCE	I was seeing someone.
LAWYER	answer, just continues his pacing. The lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts down his pen.) Look, if you cant be honest with me...
LAWRENCE	was visiting someone. It wasnt a patient. Alright? (He sighs, shakes his head. Hes fucked, either way.) What am I gonna do?
LAWYER	Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now. Because no one is going to believe you later.
LAWRENCE	(sighs) That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder.
SING	Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up. (His voice indicates that he still
LAWRENCE	Good! Can I go home now?
SING	(continuing) We have one of the victims who managed to escape. (As he speaks, we see a young woman with brown hair in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass being led carefully into the room next to them and sat at a table. This is AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her clearly; she cannot see them.) Want to know if you wouldnt mind sticking around and listening to her testimony? Maybe itll trigger something. (Tapp and an unidentified bald black man in a suit enter the room. The man guides Amanda into her chair, stands behind her against the wall. Tapp sits in a
LAWRENCE	really, but...
SING	him out of this that easily) Well, wed really appreciate it. Shes the only one who made it.
LAWRENCE	(quietly, giving in.) Okay.
TAPP	your own time, tell me the first thing you remember.
AMANDA	(VO) I woke up. All I could taste was blood. (The camera moves back quickly, and we see her tied to the chair, her wrists bound to the arms of the chair. She pulls against her bonds, moaning loudly, trying to speak or cry out but cannot.) And metal.
JIGSAW	know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Heres what happens if you lose. a device like the one shes wearing attached to a mannequin head. As he continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and heavier, and her moans pick up more.) The device youre wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, Ill show you.
JIGSAW	(from the TV) There is only one key to open the device. Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice.
AMANDA	And then I saw the body.
AMANDA	There was a knife.
SING	been injected with an opiate overdose. He couldnt move or feel much of anything.
LAWRENCE	You mean....he was alive?
SING	(staring, nods slightly) Was.
TAPP	What happened after you took it off?
JIGSAW	Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.
TAPP	You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isnt that right, Mandy? (she nods, but doesnt look up.) Do you think that is why he picked you? (She lets out a sob, briefly nodding once.) Are you grateful, Mandy?
AMANDA	(softly) He...helped me.
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	(nods slightly) Yeah, Im sure.
ADAM	He speaks accusingly) How do I know youre telling the truth? You can be the one who put me in this room! (he gesticulates as he speaks, pointing
LAWRENCE	situation youre in.
ADAM	Wrong. (he stands up, kicking his chained foot out. Shouts.) Wrong! Youve got one thing I dont: Information! (He hovers as close as he can in a threatening pose, pointing) You know who did this! when he broke the mirror, holds it up threateningly to Lawrence) Now you either tell me what is really going on (Lawrence rolls his eyes, turns his head over to his left, away from Adam) or Ill cut you with this, you hear me? Ill cut- (But he stops short as he sees something in the glass. He flips it over, studying it, flips it back. He looks over to the mirror on the wall,
LAWRENCE	What?
ADAM	the mirror.) Its a two-way mirror.
MAN	
ADAM	is. Reality TV.
MAN	on a power trip) Dont look at me. I cant help you.
ADAM	Can you hear me in there? Huh? Im having a blast. (he bends down and picks up This is the most fun Ive had without lubricant. (Hums the piece of debris at the window. It makes a thwacking sound, but doesnt break. Not even a crack.) Make sure youre getting everything. another piece of debris. It hits, but no breakage. Leans down for another
LAWRENCE	to do anything.
ADAM	want to leave it running on us? (the
LAWRENCE	stop it. (shot switches to regular view) Thats why we cant cut through these chains. Its why you wont break that glass. (he gestures to the pipe then the glass) Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him. (He appears deep in thought, starting to understand the set-up more so, figuring out the way this guy thinks. Almost admiring him. The situation may be bad, but its
ADAM	You sound like you admire this prick.
LAWRENCE	you have to understand what a perfect engine it is. Thats how you fight disease. walls, around the room) Now the tape told us to find an X. That X has to be somewhere in this room. (determined) Help me find it.
ADAM	How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when your wife and kid are out there. (Shot Hes got them, too. (Shot of the clock; its now 12:05.) He could be doing anything to them right now. Are you thinking about that?
LAWRENCE	angrily) I AM thinking about that. (Adam backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, Ive been the last thing I said to my daughter.
ALISON	Diana, Honey, are you okay? (she pushes back the covers and gets up, crouching down in front of her daughter. Looking up at her, she places her hands on her daughters arms.) Diana, Honey, can you hear me?
DIANA	fear) Mommy?
ALISON	Oh, what is it, sweet pea?
DIANA	(very calmly) Theres a man in my room.
ALISON	Honey, are you sure hes not just hiding in your imagination?
DIANA	He talked to me.
ALISON	(sighs) Okay, Ill come and check your room. (She smiles a small, assuring
DIANA	I want Daddy. Hell get the scary man.
ALISON	you want. Come on.
ALISON	Larry, sorry to bother you, but your daughter had a bad dream again.
LAWRENCE	raises his finger to pause them) Just a minute.
ALISON	She wants you to check her room.
LAWRENCE	mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph.
ALISON	(softly) You know what sweetie? Ill go check with you.
LAWRENCE	
LAWRENCE	Theres no one in your room. Theres no such thing as the bad man. Now can you go to sleep?
DIANA	Im still scared.
LAWRENCE	You are? Give me your tootsie. (He pulls back the covers and she pulls out her foot. He takes it in his hand.) Oh, what a big tootsie. (He turns to her, raising his eyebrows up) Remember this one? (He counts on her toes as he says the following) This little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, this little piggy had none, and this little piggy went Weeee! (he tickles all the way home!
DIANA	I hate that thing.
LAWRENCE	Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. You know what Daddys job is like. Now, come on. (he re-tucks her in, she smiles at him.) Lets see. Try and get some sleep now, okay? (He gives her a kiss,
DIANA	Youre not going to leave us, are you, Daddy?
LAWRENCE	(suddenly concerned) What? (He stops at the door, turns, goes back over to her bed, sits down next to her and leans over. This was the last thing hed expected her to say) What are you talking about? You mean, leave you and Mommy? (She nods; he reaches up and gently brushes her hair away from her face.) No, no sweetheart, I would never do that. Who gave you that idea?
DIANA	No one.
LAWRENCE	Well its not true, okay?
DIANA	
LAWRENCE	How much do I love you?
LAWRENCE & DIANA	Love you very much
LAWRENCE	Thats right, thats right! (He gives her a kiss, pulls back.) Good night, sweetie.
DIANA	Good night, Daddy.
LAWRENCE	Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite story.
DIANA	(with a small smile) Okay.
LAWRENCE	
ALISON	I dont know how much longer I can do this, Larry.
LAWRENCE	she means) What, what are you talking about?
ALISON	through life pretending that youre happy?
LAWRENCE	I am happy.
ALISON	(confrontational) That is complete bullshit. side in her darkened room, clutching her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes are open, she can hear everything. We stay with her for the rest of Alisons line, her voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible) Id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least thered be some passion in it.
LAWRENCE	Would you like to see her? (He reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side. The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere.
ADAM	Shes beautiful.
LAWRENCE	Thank you.
ADAM	gonna have any more kids?
LAWRENCE	talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, its difficult enough to concentrate on one. (The tone of his voice indicates that maybe hes starting to realize that he shouldve spent more time and
ADAM	the lucky wife? (a small smile)
LAWRENCE	Theres another picture behind the one youre looking at. (Adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks) Its my favourite one because were all in it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means Im always missing from the photos.
JIGSAW	see more with your eyes shut.
ADAM	Its uh, its not here.
LAWRENCE	nostalgic bliss) What?
ADAM	Uh, this photo youre talking about...its not here.
LAWRENCE	Are you sure?
ADAM	Yeah. (Tucking the picture in his right hand, he shifts slightly by lifting himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily putting the photograph down and tossing the wallet with his left hand. Lawrence picks up the wallet and starts looking for it, creasing his brow in concern, while Adam backs up against his wall, holding the photograph out of Lawrences sight against a pipe he rests his arm
LAWRENCE	mustve taken it. I...
ALISON	that youre happy?
LAWRENCE	I am happy. (He walks over to a chair, leaning over it as he puts something down, gets his briefcase ready to go to work. Alison stands a few feet behind him, trying her best to get him to react,
ALISON	Id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least thered be some passion in it.
LAWRENCE	that important, like there really is nothing wrong) We can talk about this alter, okay? (He leans in to kiss her,
ALISON	(firmly) Just leave.
VOICE	Goodnight, little girl. (camera pans up closer into the closet, and we a widened blue eye and part of a face
ALISON	Diana!?
ALISON	Diana! (opens the door and flips on the light, gasps when she sees a figure covered by a blanket looming over Dianas bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana and she screams, struggling against him. Alison goes for them.
ALISON	Dont do that! Leave her! Get away from her!
ALISON	hands off of my daughter!
VOICE	you little man...I see you...(cut to a television screen with the video of Zep in the window. Fade back and to the right as we get a view of someones apartment. Plastered on the walls are various photographs, which we can barely make out, and a desk in the corner with some recording equipment. As we move further right and hit the window we see Detective Tapp, leaning over the camera shooting the Gordons window, adjusting the view. Something about him seems just not right. We cut back to his view from the camera.) Does Dr. Gordon know youre at home with his wife? I know you know something. (his voice goes up a bit louder) What are you doing in there? Waiting for the doctor? Im waiting for the doctor, too. Hmm.
TAPP	I never should have let you go...
TAPP	I never shouldve let you go...
LAWRENCE	really just glad to be out of Tapps company) Here we are. That was uh, quite an amazing story that poor woman told.
LAWRENCE	the car window.) Look, Im sorry I cant be of more help to your investigation.
TAPP	a dentist last week who like to play with kids a bit too much. He lived two blocks from here. The sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, Doctor.
JIGSAW	know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Heres what happens if you lose. Theres a timer at the back of the device youre wearing. When the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open.
SING	
JIGSAW	bear trap.
JIGSAW	(from video) Ill show you...
SING	Hey Tapp?
TAPP	Mmm?
SING	Were gonna go down to the Grill, go get a beer. You wanna come?
TAPP	I dont think so. Thanks anyway.
SING	know I always ask. (He puts on his jacket)
JIGSAW	(on video) There is only one key...
SING	Ill leave you to have fun up here.
JIGSAW	dead cellmate.
SING	I dont mean for this to be disrespectful...(pause) Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
JIGSAW	dead cellmate.
JIGSAW	that Im not lying. (Sing steps off to the right) You better hurry up. (Tapp
TAPP	Wait wait wait, Sing!
TAPP	Get back here!
SING	What?
TAPP	
SING	(sighs then comes over) What?
TAPP	Remember 118th Street?
SING	Ah...K2K. That gangs territory was only about four blocks.
TAPP	Now listen to this.
TAPP	(looking up at Sing) We gotta check the records from all the fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks. Go, right now! Mmm! Close up of a map, with Sing speaking in a voiceover. As he speaks, theres a brief shot of the two of them sitting over the map, then quick shots of a few black and white photographs of a warehouse, including a close up of a street sign Stygian St.
SING	we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street. Its an old listing. Used to be a mannequin factory. (cut back to view of the two detectives) You think we have enough for a warrant, though?
TAPP	Who said anything about a warrant? (He
SING	
TAPP	Why not?
SING	Yeah, why not? (He grabs his gun, snaps a cartridge into it, grabsup his coat, and quickly follows Tapp.
TAPP	(VO) At least well have the cover of darkness.
SING	(VO) Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
TAPP	I got you...
TAPP	What the hell is this?.......(his voice almost a whisper) Oh shit...
SING	Oh fuck!
TAPP	
SING	off a bit loudly) What?
TAPP	
SING	Why? Weve fucking got him.
TAPP	We dont know what he looks like. Lets see what hes gonna do.
SING	(rather loudly, again) No fucking way!
TAPP	Sing, Sing! (he moves in front of the man a bit, holding up his hand to try to halt Sing, trying to convince him
SING	(isnt buying into it) Fuck that. Im gonna take him.
TAPP	Sing!
SING	What the fuck? Shit!
TAPP	Wait Sing, listen.
JIGSAW	Awake already, Jeff? I need more powerful tranquilizers next time. (Jeff continues his cries, sheds a few tears. Jigsaw Dont cry. Ive given your life a purpose. Youre a test subject for something greater than yourself.
SING	Freeze! Police!
TAPP	Hold it right there! Dont move!
SING	Put your fucking hands in the air!
JIGSAW	Now youll make a choice. (Sing runs up the steps to try to where Jigsaw is, gun aimed at him. Tapp remains where he stands.) In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.
TAPP	Shut up and get down here!
SING	did you do? Turn it off!
TAPP	Sing, stop that thing! Im taking this bastard down. (Sing tosses Tapp the shotgun.) Move!
SING	
TAPP	Tell him how to stop it!
JIGSAW	One key will unlock it.
SING	
JIGSAW	Its in the box.
SING	Box! (He sees a box on the side of the chair and opens it. Inside he pulls out a ring of at least 30 keys, and goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock the device. He tries a couple of keys, none working.) Fuck! Which key, which key?!
TAPP	Tell him which key it is!
JIGSAW	His back is to us, we still dont see his face.) Time is running out.
TAPP	Shut up and get down here right now, asshole!
JIGSAW	Whats more important to you Officer, arresting me or the life of another human being?
TAPP	Get down on your knees!
SING	Jesus! Tapp! Tapp!
TAPP	Hands behind your head! (Jigsaw obliges) Sick bastard.
JIGSAW	Yes, I am sick, Officer.
SING	Hes in a full-fledged panic. Jeff closes his eyes, crying, as the drills are only 2 inches away) Tapp! Its like, theres a hundred keys in here!
JIGSAW	Sick from the disease eating away at me inside. Sick of people who dont appreciate their blessings. Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.
JIGSAW	hidden up his right sleeve) Sick of it all! (He lashes upwards, slashing
SING	down from Jeff towards them. Tapp clutches
SING	no! Tapp! Shit!
SING	then head) Ill be back, okay? Ill be back.
SING	(shouting) Freeze or Ill shoot!
TAPP	on your knees. (He sits forward, getting some things off the coffee table) Youre running. Youre running...(He gets up and goes over to the desk in the corner with the audio recording device and dozens of photos pinned to the wall, takes a seat) Youre running scared because we had you. Im going to close this case. Ram close it. (He picks up a small framed photograph, which we Right, Sing? Right? Were gonna close it, Sing.
LAWRENCE	X Marks the spot...(He stands, touching the pipe and looking up and around a bit.) X marks the spot...we need to search this room again. (He turns and looks over at Adam.) What are you doing over there?
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	because Im stuck in this room with you doesnt mean I have to report to you every ten seconds.
LAWRENCE	in us not helping one another.
ADAM	well what do you want me to do? Im on a leash.
LAWRENCE	Thats exactly why we need to talk. We need to think!
ADAM	I am thinking!
LAWRENCE	me in the dark about what youre thinking!
ADAM	Turn off the lights.
LAWRENCE	What?
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	(doesnt get it) Why?
ADAM	a second!
ADAM	Jesus, behind you!
LAWRENCE	(turns and sees it, is surprised) How come we didnt see that before?
ADAM	The lights in here hadnt charged it. It must be glow in the dark paint or something.
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	see the small lock on it.) Its locked. something) The key, the one from my envelope. Where is it?
ADAM	
ADAM	invention on this planet!
ADAM	Make that second most beautiful invention! to toss it.) Give me that.
LAWRENCE	Are you joking? Youre gonna put something we found in this room in your mouth?
ADAM	it! Give me that sweet cancer. (Lawrence ignores his request, tosses out the other cigarette and a lighter. He finds lastly a small folded up note with the words Shh, Doctor, written on it.) I dont care, I really dont. Give me one of those.
JIGSAW	promise. Smoking is only poisonous when it ends in bloodshed. Think about this - you dont need a gun to kill Adam.
ADAM	a cigarette?
LAWRENCE	(ignoring his plea) Im trying the police. phone, but a weird beeping noise indicating the call cant go through comes from Shit. (Pause, thinks.) This was meant to receive calls, not make them. (A moment; he realizes something.) Wait a minute...this has happened before.
LAWRENCE	the hospital. (fade into another closer shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking I was walking back to my car. (He stops a moment) I thought I was alone, but Im sure someone else was there. (He squints, bringing his hand up over his eyes. There is a flash from the side. He looks up, startled, looking in the direction in which he thinks it came from, but sees nothing. He looks around him for another moment, then continues
LAWRENCE	That...thing. It was waiting for me. up at Adam. Adam is just standing there, staring at him. Something seems a bit...off. With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses him.) How did you know to turn off the lights?
ADAM	Who cares? It worked.
LAWRENCE	Yeah, but how did you know?
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	Yeah.
LAWRENCE	You know what? (he looks down, then back up at Adam.) Youre a terrible liar.
ADAM	know me.
LAWRENCE	me?
ADAM	see. On my sixth birthday, my best friend at that time, Scott Tibbs, stabbed me with a rusty nail. I didnt tell you about that. I didnt tell you that my last girlfriend, (Lawrence lowers who was a feminist vegan punk, broke up with me because she thought I was too angry. Uh, I havent told you that one of my toenails is slightly...
LAWRENCE	(snaps at him, fed up) Just stop it. You knew to turn off these lights.
ADAM	(turning away from Lawrence) What-ever.
LAWRENCE	(stands up, frustrated.) Im dealing with a juvenile.
ADAM	wanna know?
LAWRENCE	(exasperated) Yeah!
ADAM	Here it is. (He throws it towards Lawrence, who looks down at it, then back up at Adam before getting down on the floor and pulling it towards him with the hinged box. He picks it up, sitting
LAWRENCE	turns it over, then back. Adam casts his eyes downwards, still standing but W...where did you get this?
ADAM	the photo of your daughter.
LAWRENCE	W...why didnt you show me this before?
ADAM	I couldnt. (Lawrence begins to shakily sob, touching the photo.) Im sorry. in his corner, lowering his head and upper body forward, holding his head
LAWRENCE	What are you doing to them you bastard?! sniffling and crying for a moment. Then, Okay...okay..(he looks around a bit) Okay, Ive got to think now...(He looks
JIGSAW	a gun to kill Adam. When theres that much poison in your blood (a slow shot moving to the pool of blood from the body in front of Lawrence), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.
ADAM	What are you doing?
ADAM	Hey! What the hell are you doing?
LAWRENCE	me. I want you to play along with me on this.
LAWRENCE	You got that? (he turns the lights back on, both of them again wincing at the bright light. Lawrence glances at the surveillance camera, then looks to Adam.
LAWRENCE	still want that cigarette?
ADAM	Um...yeah, sure.
LAWRENCE	There! Ive done it! Ive killed him with the poison, just like you wanted. (shouting) Now wheres my family?! Where are they?!
ADAM	Christ!!
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	(wide eyed) I just got electrocuted!
LAWRENCE	What? (he rolls his eyes. Unbelievable. He speaks in a hushed tone.) That was our way out!
ADAM	said? (he desperately grabs at the manacle around his ankle, pulling at it and shrieking) Get this thing off me! Get it off!
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	now hes pissed at Lawrence for his disbelief) You think I would make that up just to mess up your stupid fucking charade?
LAWRENCE	All right, thats it! (He leans over and picks up his saw, sits down and starts trying to saw through his chains again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, just sits back against the wall, breathing heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues to franticly saw, but it doesnt work. He gets pissed off and throws the blade down.) Ah, Damn it!!
ADAM	(wide-eyed) I remember everything now. (Lawrence glances over at him.) I remember how I got here.
ADAM	Great.
ADAM	Is someone there? (he takes a picture, the flash lighting up the area in front of him.) I can hear you. (He takes another picture, the flash lighting up a living room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping
ADAM	picture in its direction and sees the Puppet from Jigsaws workshop and video sitting in an armchair, continuing its evil laugh.) Christ! (He reaches down and finds a baseball bat on the floor, and starts hitting the doll as hard as he can until the laugh starts to fade and then just dies out. ) What the...
ADAM	Who is that?! Whos in there?! (he moves towards the door, shaking but trying to be a tough guy) Come on out! Ill kill you, you motherfucker! (He opens the door, holds the camera and takes a picture. As soon as the flash goes off we see the red-robed pig thing that originally grabbed Lawrence quickly
LAWRENCE	
DIANA	
LAWRENCE	
DIANA	Daddy, is that you? (cut to a shot of her being held by Zep, the phone to
LAWRENCE	Im here. (Adam watches him intently)
DIANA	
LAWRENCE	worry honey, everythings going to be okay. Wheres Mommy?
DIANA	Shes here with me.
LAWRENCE	can for his daughter) Let me talk to her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on.
DIANA	The bad man from my room is here. He has us tied up and he has a gun.
LAWRENCE	W...what man?
DIANA	Please come home Daddy! (Zep kisses her on the top of her head and takes
LAWRENCE	Hello? Hello? Diana?
LAWRENCE	(desperate) Diana! Diana!
ALISON	Larry?
LAWRENCE	Ally? Is that you? (We see a shot of Alison giving a threatening look through
ALISON	Is Adam there?
LAWRENCE	to watch him worriedly) How do you know? Ally, what is going on?
ALISON	and get this message to him) Dont believe Adams lies. He knows you. He knew all about you before today. (Zep quickly takes the phone away, hangs up. Cut back to the bathroom, Lawrence on the
LAWRENCE	Hello? Ally? Ally? (No answer, just the dial tone. He stands up.) Hello? screaming) God damn you! If you so much as lay a finger on them, Ill kill you! You hear me? You son of a bitch! Ill kill you! (He sits down, leaning forward over the floor, crying a bit. He slams
ADAM	a dangerous animal) Are they okay?
LAWRENCE	is clearly underneath the surface) My wife, she uh, she mentioned your name.
ADAM	eyes, but he acts surprised) What did she say?
LAWRENCE	She told me...not to believe you.
ADAM	me about what? (There is no doubt hes
LAWRENCE	of 1000 deaths) She told me you knew me. (He stands, looming menacingly, the look stronger on his face) Who are you?
ADAM	still not making eye contact) You know who I am.
LAWRENCE	Youre a liar! I need to know the truth!
ADAM	hiding, had it with Lawrence) Im a liar? (Finally, he looks up, right at What did you do last night, Lawrence? Work at a hospital? Saving sick children? You told me that after you left your house last night, you went to work at a hospital.
LAWRENCE	truth.
ADAM	is right, Larry. (Lawrence is now the one wearing the Oh shit look.) You dont recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot?
ADAM	I can prove that you didnt go anywhere near a hospital last night. (He leans over and pulls out the garbage bag from the tub. Lawrence stands, staring at him in near disbelief. He has been caught. Adam takes a handful of photos from the baggie hed kept hidden inside the garbage bag, holds them up and throws them down, scattering them.) Its not the first time Ive done it either, Larry. (Lawrence leans over to look at the photos on the floor in front of him with complete and utter disbelief, Ive been taking pictures of you for a few days now. (Shots of some of Adams pictures. Lawrence going into a building,
LAWRENCE	You wanna know what I do? I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels to fuck their secretaries. (we start seeing more shots Adam took while following Lawrence) Last night I went to your house. (Flashback of Adam holding his camera, then cut to several photographs of Lawrence leaving his house, glancing over his shoulder and moving down the sidewalk) I watched you leave. I followed you (Lawrence in the parking garage, photographs of the exterior of the Hotel Barfly. Lawrence inside the hotel, knocking on the door to one of the rooms while Adam hides around the corner with his camera) all the way to that shitbag hotel. (Photographs of Lawrence standing
LAWRENCE	Youve uh, had these with you the whole time?
ADAM	I found them, in there (points to the toilet; quick flashback of Adam pulling the bag out of the top of the toilet, then Adam opening the bag and seeing the hacksaws and a glimpse of something else in the bag.) with the hacksaws. I dont know how they got there.
LAWRENCE	of it! (He angrily crumples up and throws
ADAM	were both bulls hitters. But my camera isnt. It doesnt know how to lie. It only shows you whats put right in front of it. Just out of curiosity, what did you do in that motel room? You got out of there pretty fast.
LAWRENCE	Why did you um, deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home?
CARLA	I didnt know if you were going to make it. (turns, goes and sits on the bed.)
LAWRENCE	gave you a precise time at which to page me. (He puts the briefcase on a chair by the door then goes over and sits down next to her on the bed.) You cant do that.
CARLA	Its not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff. (She starts unbuttoning her shirt. Lawrence holds out his hand and stops her. She looks up at him, concerned.) Whats wrong, Dr. Gordon?
LAWRENCE	for me to makes you come here.
CARLA	
LAWRENCE	-Please. (very softly) Im sorry. (He stands and heads over to the door. Carla
LAWRENCE	You tell anyone you were here?
CARLA	No. (She stands, goes over to the phone and answers it.) Hello? (She listens, turns to Lawrence) Its for you. (She
LAWRENCE	Hello?
VOICE	I know what youre doing...Doctor.
LAWRENCE	
LAWRENCE	What happened?
LAWRENCE	Ive got to go. (He picks up his briefcase from the chair, and heads out the door.
LAWRENCE	Who was it?
ADAM	Who was what?
LAWRENCE	The person who paid you to follow me, who was it?
ADAM	and he gives me the money up front. Two hundred bucks a night. If Id have known I was gonna end up here, I wouldve asked for a hell of a lot more.
LAWRENCE	(pissy) What does that mean? Does that mean you saw what happened to me?
ADAM	What I saw was you get into your car. Thats it. I didnt ask your name. I didnt know who you were. I dont know how I got here, I dont know how you got here. I just took the shots (As he speaks, a quick flashback of Adam taking a picture, going up apartment stairs, then in the darkroom) and went straight home to develop the. Next thing I know Im chained to a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at the guy Ive been taking shots of all night.
LAWRENCE	Clearly, whoever paid you to take the pictures of me is the one who put is in here.
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course it is! What did he look like?
ADAM	(internal shrug) I dont know, he was just a guy. (Shot of inside Adams apartment and an unidentifiable figure towards the back of the room, the image darkened so we cant make him out. The figure
LAWRENCE	Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?
ADAM	I dont take notes about his appearance.
LAWRENCE	anything?) You must remember something about him.
ADAM	I cant. (Shot of inside the apartment,
LAWRENCE	Youre telling me you dont remember a thing about the guy?
ADAM	I told you, I- (inside apartment, the figure moves closer, just about close
LAWRENCE	for fucks sake! I give up!
ADAM	Hes a tall black guy, hes got a scar around his neck, okay? (Shot of inside the apartment, the figure moves into
LAWRENCE	Tapp! (shot of inside Adams apartment, Tapp handing us/Adam money. Adams/our hand reaches out and takes it quickly. Then, back to Lawrence) Detective Tapp!
ADAM	Whoa, the guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop.
LAWRENCE	No, no, he was discharged from the police force. (Shot of Tapp at his desk with He broke down after his partner was killed (Tapp and Sing sitting next to each other in Lawrences office), but that didnt stop him from harassing me. (Lawrence sitting in the car next to Tapp) The guy became obsessed. (Tapp in his current apartment adjusting the camera in the window, then a shot of him leaning over a notebook, going over notes.) Hes convinced himself that I must have somehow been involved with the murders. Hes...hes crazy. (Tapp at the corner desk in his apartment, giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh laugh. The shot cuts back to Lawrence, who points accusingly at Adam.) And you helped him. (disgusted) You took money from him to invade my privacy. How could you do that?
ADAM	
LAWRENCE	(sarcastic) Right, right. You know what Adam? Youre not a victim of this game, youre a part of it. (Points accusingly
ADAM	Oh really? Obviously this cop thinks youre the one behind it all.
LAWRENCE	turning around slightly, internal eye roll.) I told you, hes not a cop. Hes a bottom feeder, just like you. (A slight sneer from Lawrence at Adam. Lawrence
ADAM	pissed off about? The fact that I took some shots of you or the fact that I took some shots of you while you were cheating on your wife?
LAWRENCE	I did not cheat on her!!!
ADAM	What do you care what I think anyway? I dont give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gang bang!
LAWRENCE	(weakly) How did I get here? (Adam sits down on the pipe in his corner, leaning forward a bit.) I had...I had everything in order. (he lays down on his side, My whole life was in perfect order.
ALISON	Sweetheart, are you okay? (Diana shakes her head no) Mommy just needs you to be really, really, really strong right now. Im not gonna let anybody hurt you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay, thats my good girl. (She starts crying as her hands work behind her to loosen
ADAM	Hey, was there someone else at your house last night besides your wife and daughter?
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	here. (He tosses the photo to Lawrence, whosits up, picks it up and looks at it. After a moment, the shot cuts back
LAWRENCE	(realization) I know him. (We see the photo as well. It is a shot looking up into Lawrences window, with Zep Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. The shot goes back and forth between him as his eyes widen while Lawrence makes his threats.) His name is Zep. Hes an orderly at my hospital. (his voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. You perverted little psychopath. Im gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck!
ADAM	Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads at 6:00.) Were out of time.
DIANA	(crying) Mommy help me!
ZEP	Dr. Gordons time is up. Now Ive gotta do what Ive gotta do, and...Im afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed.
LAWRENCE	Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam gets up from his corner, moves forward slightly) I know its you, you son of a bitch!
ALISON	Larry?
LAWRENCE	with worry) Ally?
ALISON	(looking right at Zep, firmly) You failed.
LAWRENCE	Hello? Hello?
ALISON	Dont move, stay on the ground. Give me the phone. Give it to me! (He sits up a bit, carefully slides it to her. He is watching her, looking for an opportunity to overcome her once again. She picks the phone up, still keeping her eyes and her gun at him.) Larry?
LAWRENCE	Ally! Honey, are you all right?
ALISON	No! No were not...(Zep starts to move up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens him more fiercely with the gun.) Get down! Larry, where are you?
LAWRENCE	(unsure himself) I dont know. Im being held captive in a room somewhere.
ALISON	What are you talking about?
LAWRENCE	
ALISON	
LAWRENCE	everything. Its my fault. Please forgive me. Ive always been happy with you.
DIANA	
LAWRENCE	(panicked) Ally!
LAWRENCE	
DIANA	Mommy, help me!
TAPP	Freeze!
TAPP

Im gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. over to the computer station, taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. We see Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep glances over and sees Tapp get to his feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. He empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming.
ADAM	Lawrence! (A bit of foamy spittle comes out of Lawrences mouth as the electrocution continues, and then a moment later stops. Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence is out.) Lawrence, get up! Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They race through the streets as fast as they can.
ADAM	Get up! I need you! (He leans down and finds a piece of debris on the floor, throws it at Lawrence. It doesnt hit him. He leans down, picks up another, throws it. This one bounces onto the floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence starts to move more, reaching for his head and sitting up. Adam cries out in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought you were dead!
LAWRENCE	electrocuted me...
ADAM	I told you! The same thing happened to me, see? I wasnt lying, see?
LAWRENCE	
LAWRENCE	
ADAM	for Lawrence.) Lawrence, calm down. There must be a way out of this! (It seems to be a complete role reversal for the two of them from the beginning, where Adam was the one freaking out and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is terrified but still calmer than Lawrence,
LAWRENCE	(screaming) I cant be calm! My family needs me! No, God! (He cries and screams, still cant get the phone. He quickly turns and sits up, grabbing the chain and pulling it as he lets out a terrible scream of rage. Adams hands are up clutching his head, trying to keep his
ADAM	continued loud, primal screams.) Lawrence, I have a family too! I dont see them, thats my mistake. Its a mistake Id like to fix!
TAPP	Im gonna kill you you sick asshole!
ADAM	stance) Lawrence, stop it!
ADAM	calm down! Theres a way out of here, theres a way out!
ADAM	Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you doing?!
ADAM	
ADAM	What are you...(He suddenly realizes Lawrences intentions. His eyes go wide,
ADAM	Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence dont! the chamber) No! Lawrence, please, Im begging you! (Lawrence aims the gun at Adam) Lawrence, its not me who did this to you!
LAWRENCE	You have to die.
ADAM	moving side to side to try to throw off Lawrences aim) No, I want to live!
LAWRENCE	Im sorry...
ADAM	I want to live!
LAWRENCE	My family...(he aims and pulls the trigger, hitting Adam in the upper chest area. Adam falls down forward onto the floor,
LAWRENCE	Ive done it! Now show them to me! (he continues to cry, dropping the gun next to him, collapsing back down with his
NEIGHBOR	Officer.
ALISON	(on cell phone) Larry?
NEIGHBOR	to Alison) Did you get through to him?
ALISON	Theres still no answer.
NEIGHBOR	called the police. Everythings okay.
LAWRENCE	You bastard! Ill fucking kill you! but is too weak and Zep pulls away, looking down at him, moving over to the other side of the body) Ill fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! (Lawrence quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up the gun, pulling the trigger several times, but there are no more bullets. It just clicks.) Ill fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill you! Ill fucking kill you!
ZEP	Youre too late.
LAWRENCE	
ZEP	Its the rules.
LAWRENCE	going to be all right. (Adam stops sobbing for a moment) Youre just wounded in the shoulder. I have to go and get help.
ADAM	Dont leave me! No!
ADAM	No!! (he keeps crying) No! No! (Lawrence crawls towards the door.) Lawrence! Lawrence!
LAWRENCE	Dont...Dont worry, Ill bring someone back, I promise. (He continues crawling on, out the door while Adam watches him pathetically, still crying and reaching
ADAM	
JIGSAW	(VO) Hello Mr. Hindle. Or as they called you around the hospital: (shot of Zep in the hospital with his cleaning cart, stopping at Johns room) Zep. I want you to make a choice. (Shot of the closet doors in Dianas room flying open, Diana screaming, Alison coming in and seeing him looming over her. Shot of him tying and gagging Alison and Diana. Shot of the photo of Diana and Alison tied and gagged.) Theres a slow-acting poison coursing through your system (shot of Zep watching the monitor, holding his hand to his mouth. He actually looks rather ill) which only I have the antidote for. Will you murder and mother and to save yourself? (Shot of Zep next to Alison, saying Dr. Gordons time is up; holds the phone to her ear. Shot of Zep in the living room, screaming Mrs. Gordon! Shot of Zep on the floor firing up at Tapp.) Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules. (Lawrence on the floor looking up at Zep, asks
JOHN	The key to that chain is in the bathtub.
JOHNS VOICE	Sick of people who dont appreciate their blessings. Shot of Lawrence with Diana, checking his beeper, on his computer ignoring Diana and Alison, trying to kiss Alison as she pulls away.
JOHN	Adam, Dr. Gordon. (As he says each name, the following image of them appears: A shot of Mark screaming with the safe, Paul in his cage while still alive, Amanda in her mask in the chair, Zep watching on the monitor, Adam holding the tape recorder to his ear, Lawrence holding the tape recorder to his ear. Then, a shot of the Puppet on the video as he says) I want to play a game.
JOHN	be alive. (John turns off the lights at the door, only the green lighting from the hallway illuminating him and then Adam just barely. John moves out the door, slowly.) But not you. (Adam reaches out for him and screams. John turns around and takes the door handle, starting to slide it shut.) Not anymore.
JOHN	GAME OVER.
