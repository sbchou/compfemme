Mechanics hands change tires, replace air cleaners, close a *	CONTINUED: 3 CONTINUED: 4
MAN	...it's always you. Why is everything always directed at you...?

WOMAN	...oh, bullshit! How about the dig about the makeover...?
MAN	...what do you want me to do, punch the guy out? I work with him. And you're perfectly capable of taking care of your own...... CONTINUED: 6

ASSISTANT'S VOICE (UNHEARD) *	Off of what? *
ANNIE *	Off the line sheets. *
ASSISTANT'S VOICE (UNHEARD) *	Why? *
ANNIE *	'Cause I think it's him on there. In * the gold Lexus on the cell. If it is, * he's enhanceable, 'cause of priors in * the late '80's... *
ASSISTANT'S VOICE (O.S.) *	What about tomorrow afternoon? *

MAX	I'll take 105 east and up the 110. It's faster.
ANNIE	What?
MAX	105 to the 110 is faster.
ANNIE	110 turns into a parking lot around USC.
MAX	This late, the 110 is moving, but La * Brea north of the Santa Monica is * jammed. *
ANNIE	110 north of the 10 you get people * going to Pasadena and they drive slow. *
MAX	That's why I jump off at Grand. * But, hey, surface streets is cool. That's what you want, that's what we do... *
ANNIE	Are we taking bets? What if you're wrong?
MAX	Your ride is free.
ANNIE	You got yourself a deal.
Max's cab maneuvers easily through light traffic past golf	CONTINUED: 13
ANNIE	Go ahead, say it. Go ahead.

ANNIE (CONT'D)	You mind turning this up?
MAX	You like Bach?
ANNIE	I used to play this piece in high school.
MAX	Let me guess. Woodwinds?
ANNIE	Viola. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
MAX	Could'a fooled me, the way you were unloading into that cell phone.
ANNIE	Different instrument... You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be all bogged down in traffic right now, and you would have made an extra five bucks.
MAX	Yeah? Keep it. Buy yourself something. Go wild. CONTINUED: (2) 13
ANNIE	A gentleman. I thought chivalry was a necessary casualty of gender politics...
MAX	Not a big thing, you know...?
ANNIE	How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
MAX	There were two of us. I killed the other guy. I don't like competition...
ANNIE	You take pride in...being the best at * what you do...?
MAX	This? This is temporary. You know. Pays the bills. I fill in with this. I WILL be the best at what I do, but * that's something else.
ANNIE	What else?
MAX	I'm setting up something... *
ANNIE	Like tell me...?
MAX	...limo company I'm putting together. Island Limousines. An island on wheels. So I'm part-timing until I get delivery, Benzes off leases, work up my client lists, staff up, all * that...
MAX (CONT'D)	You like being a lawyer? CONTINUED: (3) 13
ANNIE	You psychic? CONTINUED: (4) 13
MAX	I'm starting an 800 hotline. Caught your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe. * Elegant, not too hip, which rules out * advertising, plus a top drawer briefcase, that you live out of, purse * looks like a Bodega...
ANNIE	Bottega.
MAX	...Bottega. Guy gets in my cab with a machete? I figure he's a sushi chef. You? Clarence Darrow.
ANNIE	Not quite. He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor...
MAX	Big case?
ANNIE	Yeah.
ANNIE	You got us here fast...
MAX	You never answered my question. You like what you do?
ANNIE	Yeah. CONTINUED: 15
MAX	But not right now...?
ANNIE	No, I do...like I can't wait. ...I * love standing up in that courtroom. * At the same time...I always get this clenched-up thing the night before the * first day...
MAX	Clenched-up how...? *
ANNIE	I think I'm gonna lose. I think I * suck. I think my case sucks. I * haven't prepared enough. My exhibits * aren't in order. People are gonna * figure out that I don't know what I'm * doin'. And I've had this charade * going for years. I represent the * Department of Justice of the United * States government and my opening * statement is gonna fall flat at the * really important point and the jury's * gonna laugh at me. * Then I cry... I don't throw-up. A * lot of people throw-up. I have a * strong stomach. * Then I get it together. And rewrite * my opening statement. Work the * exhibits. For the rest of the night. * That's my routine. In the morning, it starts. I'm fine. *
MAX	You need a vacation. *
ANNIE	I just had...a vacation. On the Harbor Freeway. CONTINUED: (2) 15

ANNIE	In case you ever...I don't know...wanna start an investigation of a Fortune 500 company or argue cab routes or something... ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY CRIMINAL DIVISION CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUED: 16 CONTINUED: (2) 16
VINCENT	Hello?
MAX	Uh, yeah...
VINCENT	Let's go to... You free? Or... *
MAX	Yeah, yeah, sorry... CONTINUED: 17A Where to?
VINCENT	452 South Union Street.
VINCENT	How long you think this'll take?
MAX	Fourteen minutes.
VINCENT	Fourteen? Not fifteen? Not thirteen?
MAX	Two minutes to get onto the 101. Transition to the 110 to the 10 and exit on Normandie is four minutes. North on Normandie is five minutes. Two minutes to South Union 'cause there's roadwork. Thirteen plus one for "shit happens."
VINCENT	Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride?
MAX	An apology.
MAX (CONT'D)	...I already offered up the free ride * today. *
VINCENT	To who? *
MAX	...some girl. * CONTINUED: 17B
VINCENT	Did you ask her out?
MAX	First time in LA?
VINCENT	No. To tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave. Too sprawled-out. Disconnected. You know...? But that's me. You like it here?
MAX	It's home.
VINCENT	17 million people. This was a country, it would be the fifth biggest economy in the world. But nobody knows each other. Too impersonal. * But that's just me...you know... * I read about this guy. Gets on the * MTA, here, and dies. Six hours he's riding the subway before anybody notices. This corpse doing laps around LA, people on and off, sitting next to him, nobody notices.
MAX	I see your point. Yeah...
VINCENT	Cleanest cab I've ever been in. Your regular ride?
MAX	Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.
VINCENT	Prefer nights?
MAX	People are more relaxed, you know? Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
VINCENT	You get benefits? CONTINUED: 19
MAX	Like sick leave? *
VINCENT	Retirement? Health and welfare? *
MAX	It's not that kind of job.
VINCENT	Start a union.
MAX	Me, specifically?
VINCENT	Why not?
MAX	Last thing I need is a reason to keep driving a cab. It's temporary. I'm fillin' in, you know, while this other thing I'm putting together is shaping up...
VINCENT	How long you been driving?
MAX	Twelve years.
VINCENT	Really? What else are you putting together?
MAX	I don't talk about it. No offense, but...
VINCENT	None taken. Talkers and doers. Like you, I like doers. CONTINUED: 21
VINCENT	Fourteen minutes. Man, you're good...
MAX	Lucky with the lights.
VINCENT	Yeah, sure. You probably know the light schedules, too. Listen...I'm in town on a real estate deal. A closing. One night. I got five stops to make, collect signatures. See some friends. Then I got a six a.m. out of LAX. Why don't you hang with me for the night...?
MAX	I'm not a hire car. It's against regs...
VINCENT	Regulations? These guys don't pay you sick leave. How much you pull down a shift?
MAX	Two-fifty, four hundred. *
VINCENT	I'll make it six hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX and I don't have to run for the plane.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	...take a chance.
MAX	Man, I don't know.
VINCENT	Yes, you do.
MAX	Yeah. Okay. CONTINUED: (2) 21
VINCENT	Cool. We got a deal. Here's three hundred down. What's your name? CONTINUED: (2) 21
MAX	Max.
VINCENT	Max? I'm Vincent.
MAX	I can't double park here...
VINCENT	I'll meet you in the alley behind the building.
MAX	Definitely not from around here. CONTINUED: 24
MAX	He - He fell on my cab...!
VINCENT	You always stutter?
MAX	Well, yeah. Yeah. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab from up there...!
MAX (CONT'D)	I think he's dead.
VINCENT	...taken two .45s and did a high dive onto his head. It's a good guess.
MAX	You - you killed him?
VINCENT	No. I - I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Red-light-green-light? Light's red. CONTINUED: (2) 24A
VINCENT (CONT'D)	You can run, but you'll die tired.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Put down your hands. Are you cool? Say "I am cool." *
MAX	You are cool.
VINCENT	No. You say you are cool.
MAX	I am...I'm cool.
VINCENT	Okay. Help me out here. *
MAX	With what?
VINCENT	El Gordo decided to get some air and not take the stairs. So we go to plan B. Pop the trunk. *
MAX	My trunk?
VINCENT	leave him here. So unless you want him riding up front with you...and given the hygiene... ...and his sphincters let go...
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Gonna roll him off the hood. * Always lift with your legs... * CONTINUED: (3) 24A
MAX	I don't think I can do this.
VINCENT	He's only a dead guy. On three. Uno. * Dos. Three.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Got it?
MAX	Yeah.
VINCENT	What?
MAX	His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched!
VINCENT	It's a spasm! Jesus, don't be such a girl...
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Never heard of a treadmill? *
VINCENT	Six liters of blood in the average Angeleno, he's gotta dump all his...on your cab. Okay, that's good enough. CONTINUED: 25
MAX	Uh, look...why don't you, like, take the cab...
VINCENT	"Take the cab..."
MAX	Yeah. I - I'll chill. You know. And...they don't check. You know? They don't. They don't know who's driving these things. You, me...
VINCENT	And you promise you will never tell anybody? Right? ...get in the fucking car.
VINCENT	Can we leave the scene of the crime, * now, please?
MAX	I'm trying...
VINCENT	Max.
MAX	It's not me!
VINCENT	The engine is already on. Put the little pointer on the letter "D." "D" stands for Drive. CONTINUED: 26
MAX	You're making me nervous.
VINCENT	I'm making you nervous? I'm the one on a schedule...
FANNING *	Ramone? Estas fiestando con una chica? CONTINUED: 29 CONTINUED: 30
FANNING	Fuck.
VINCENT (O.S.)	Try deep breathing.
MAX	What?
VINCENT	Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. Some people slip into shock. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Is that better?
MAX	I think so. CONTINUED: 31
VINCENT	What are you doing?
MAX	It's a mess.
VINCENT	So?
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Lady Macbeth. Leave the seats. The light's green. We're sitting here.
DRIVER	Asshole!
VINCENT	You no longer have the cleanest cab in La-La Land. You gotta live with that. * Focus on the job. Drive. 7565 Fountain. You know it?
MAX	West Hollywood.
VINCENT	How long, you figure?
MAX	Seventeen minutes. Why?
MAX (CONT'D)	Oh. Oh, no. You're kidding. We...
VINCENT	I told you we had other stops to make tonight. CONTINUED: (2) 31
MAX	You said you were visiting friends!
VINCENT	They're somebody's friends... You drive a cab. I make my rounds. We both do our jobs, you might make it through the night and come out seven hundred bucks ahead.
MAX	I...I'm not trying to piss you off, see? Okay? But I can't drive you around so you can murder people... Man, that's not my job...
VINCENT	Tonight it is.
MAX	You don't get it. I mean it. Really. I'm not up for this...
VINCENT	You are stressed. I understand that. * Keep breathing. Stay calm.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Are you breathing?
MAX	Yes.
VINCENT	Good. What else calms you down? Candy? Cigarettes? Breathe.
MAX	Music.
VINCENT	Play music.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Chopin prelude. Stodgy. Here's the deal. CONTINUED: (3) 31 You were gonna drive me around and never be the wiser. But because of El Gordo's high dive, we're into Plan B. Still breathing? Now. We have to make the best of it. Improvise. Adapt to the environment. Darwin. "Shit happens." The I * Ching...whatever. Roll with it...
MAX	I Ching? You threw a man out a window!
VINCENT	I didn't throw him, he fell.
MAX	What'd he do to you?
VINCENT	Nothing. I only met him one time.
MAX	Then how can you kill him like that?
VINCENT	I should only kill people after I get to know 'em? Six billion people on the planet and you get bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
MAX	Who, who was he?
VINCENT	What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
MAX	Rwanda. Yeah. *
VINCENT	Tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed people that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Did you bat an eye, Max? Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam or something? No. CONTINUED: (4) 31
VINCENT (CONT'D)	I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
MAX	I don't know Rwandans.
VINCENT	You don't know the guy in the trunk, either. If it makes you feel any better, he was a criminal involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
MAX	Oh, that makes it okay, then. 'Cause * all you're doing is taking out the * garbage...
VINCENT	Something like that... What you need to remember is that nobody gets out of this alive. Even if we quit smoking. Cut out red meat. Everybody dies... Please pull the vehicle over to the curb.
VINCENT	Get rid of 'em.
MAX	How?
VINCENT	You're a cabby. Talk yourself out of a ticket. CONTINUED: (5) 31
MAX	Please. Don't do anything.
VINCENT	Then don't let me get cornered. You don't have the trunk space.
MAX	I can't believe this...
VINCENT	Believe it.
MAX	Don't. I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them...!
VINCENT	Probably married.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Maybe that one's got kids. Probably * his wife's pregnant...
MAX	I'll deal with it!
COP #1	License and registration.
COP #1 (CONT'D)	Pulled you over 'cause your * windshield's smashed. * All of this current? *
MAX	Yes, officer.
COP #2	Wha'd you, have a food fight in here?
COP #2 (CONT'D)	Is that blood? *
MAX	Yeah. See... I hit a deer.
COP #1	A deer...
MAX	Over by Slauson.
COP #1	A "South Central" deer?
MAX	Goddamn deer jumped out in front of me. You believe that?
COP #1	Why you still carrying a passenger? CONTINUED: (7) 31
MAX	I was headed back to my depot, see, you know? And his drop's on the way.
COP #1	Yeah, but your cab's not safe to drive. And we're going to impound it. We need to do a vehicle inventory while we wait for the tow truck. Pop the trunk and step out of the vehicle.
COP #1 (CONT'D)	I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to phone for another cab.
VINCENT	Is that necessary, Officer? I'm just a half mile from here.
COP #1	I'm afraid it is. Please exit the vehicle. You, too.
VINCENT	You open that trunk, they go inside.
MAX	Hey, man, it's been a long day. You know? It's so slow, I pay this guy to ride so I don't get lonely... My first fare. How about a break? I'm heading to the barn, anyway...
COP #1	Get out of the car. And open the trunk...
POLICE RADIO	Officer needs help. We got a man with a gun. Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover... CONTINUED: (9) 31
COP #2	Let's go. CONTINUED: (10) 31
COP #1	Get that cab back to your garage...
VINCENT	Breathe.
VINCENT	I thought Californians exercised...?
VINCENT (CONT'D)	What are you lookin' at?
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Hands on the wheel. Ten and two. Like they taught you in driver's ed.
MAX	Why? CONTINUED: 32
VINCENT	Because I say so. *
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Cab's a disgrace. No wonder the cops * pulled you over. Max? Max? You out there, you son of a bitch?
VINCENT	Who...is that?
MAX	Lenny, my dispatcher. I know you're out there! Answer the goddamn call!
VINCENT	What happens if you don't?
MAX	He'll keep calling.
LENNY (O.S.)	Max? Answer! Vincent reaches across Max, pulls the mike off the dash, holds
VINCENT	Don't blow it.
MAX	Uh, yeah? Lenny? It's me. I got off the phone with the cops. A desk sergeant called to check you brought the cab in... CONTINUED: (2) 32
MAX	Yeah? So?
LENNY (O.S.)	So? So, aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?
MAX	It got crashed! I didn't... Do I care what, where or why? You're * payin'!
VINCENT	It was an accident. You're not liable. (Tell him.) *
MAX	It was an accident. I'm not liable.
LENNY (O.S.)	Bullshit! I'm making you liable! * It's comin' outta your goddamn pocket...
VINCENT	Tell him to stick the cab up his fat ass.
MAX	I can't do that. He's the Man.
VINCENT	So what?
MAX	I need the job.
VINCENT	No you don't. You still there? I'm talking to you! Max? Max? CONTINUED: (3) 32
VINCENT	He's not paying you a damn thing! * CONTINUED: (4) 32
LENNY (O.S.)	Who the hell are you?
VINCENT	Richard Riccardo, Assistant U.S. * Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV... Let's not get excited.
VINCENT	Not excited? How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you try to extort a working man? You know * goddamn well your collision policy and * general liability umbrella would cover the damages. What are you trying to pull, you sarcastic prick? I'm just tryin' to...to...
VINCENT	Tell it to him. Tell him he's an asshole.
MAX	You're an asshole.
VINCENT	Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.
MAX	Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna stick this yellow cab up your fat ass.
VINCENT	Don't wait up, hon. I gotta work late. CONTINUED: (5) 32 CONTINUED: (6) 32
SYLVESTER CLARKE *	He identify himself? * Sure. Let him up. *
MAX	HEY! HEY! OVER HERE! I'M IN THE CAB! HEY! HELP!
MAX (CONT'D)	HELP! GODDAMN IT! THERE'S A MAN WITH A GUN! HE'S GONNA KILL PEOPLE! CONTINUED: 32D
MAX (CONT'D)	Oh, fuck me. GODDAMN IT, I'M FLASHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE OVER HERE. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. *

WHITE GUY #1 *	Fuck that, man, gimme your wallet. CONTINUED: (4) 32D

WHITE GUY #1	I will fuck you up! Hand it over.

WHITE GUY #1	Then get your ass up, up... Yo' homie... CONTINUED: (5) 32D
VINCENT (CONT'D)	That my briefcase...?
WHITE GUY #2	May-be. And what the fuck else you got?
VINCENT	Where's the button? Under the dash?
MAX	Yeah.
VINCENT	You mind turning it off?
VINCENT	Another collateral.
MAX	What's that?
VINCENT	Collateral damage. People in the wrong place at the wrong time. And you? You attract attention? You are gonna get people killed who didn't need to be. Understand?
MAX	I'm low on gas...
VINCENT	Pull in there.
MAX	Vincent?
VINCENT	Yes, Max?
MAX	Am I collateral?
VINCENT	I haven't decided.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	But, hey! New news. We are ahead of schedule.
MAX	Huh...? *
VINCENT	We got time to kill. You like jazz?
MAX	I'm...what? Sorry?
VINCENT	Jazz.
MAX	Not that much.
VINCENT	Guy told me about a place off Crenshaw. Leimert Park. All the West Coast greats played there. Dexter Gordon, Thelonious Monk, Chet Baker. Like that... Buy you a drink. Expand your * horizons...
WEIDNER	...this informant of yours, what's his name, Ramone?
FANNING	Ramone Gallardo. Supposed to take him for a drink. I come here, find this.
WEIDNER	You been working him? *
FANNING	Four months...a low-level player, he's * been feeding me stuff on Felix. CONTINUED: 34
WEIDNER *	Reyes-Torrena? Forget Felix. Feds * are all over that. They don't want us anywhere near it.
FANNING	Since when is the LAPD working for the * Feeb? * Besides, Ramone flew out a window. My * C.I. flew out a window, he's got Felix's handprints on his ass. Yes? That makes it ours.
WEIDNER	Where's the homicide, Ray? Where's a * body? All we got is glass...
FEMALE CRIMINALIST (O.S.)	And blood... *
WEIDNER *	Huh? *
FEMALE CRIMINALIST *	...blood...down here...in the glass...here's some more...
FEMALE CRIMINALIST (CONT'D)	...small splatter patterns here...all * over there... *
FANNING	Ramone flew out the window. Went * splat. Here's the glass. * Then some tires rolled over it. *
WEIDNER	How's that spell homicide? Maybe he jumped.
FANNING	Sure. He's depressed. So he jumps four stories out a window onto his head.
FANNING (CONT'D)	"Wow, that feels better!" Picks himself up. "Now, I think I'll go on with the rest of my day..."
PLAINCLOTHES COP (O.S.)	Ray! Catch!
WEIDNER	So, who's got what? Any witnesses? We been knocking on doors?
COP #1	Old guy across the street, lives above the deli? Says he saw a cab parked here earlier tonight. There were two guys working under the hood.
WEIDNER	Description. What did he see?
COP #1	"Kinda" saw...guy's got glasses like coke bottles.
FANNING	Did he "see" it or did his seeing eye dog see it? Late-model four-door Ford. Yellow or * orange. * Maybe it was a taxi cab.
WEIDNER	Four thousand taxis in LA County. What else...?
FANNING	Remember fall, 2001? That Bay Area * deal? Oakland. Cabbie drove around * all night. Killed three people...
WEIDNER	Then he flipped out, put the gun to his head. So what? *
FANNING	So the Oakland PD detective, * whatshisname, never bought it.
WEIDNER	Why?
FANNING	The Cabbie had no criminal record. No history of mental illness. Pops three people, then himself? And the victims weren't random. Two were involved in some pharmaceuticals scam... Anyway, the detective always thought there was somebody else in that cab. CONTINUED: 35
VINCENT	...a little '60's, early Miles thing * happening... *
MAX *	I never learned to listen to jazz.
VINCENT	You don't learn to listen...anymore * than you learn to breathe. Open your * ears. *
MAX *	I get a beat. I don't really hear a * melody... *
VINCENT	...he's off the melody, behind the * notes. Outside what's expected. * Improvising off impulse. Kind of like * tonight. *
MAX *	Like tonight? *
VINCENT *	Sure. * This is nothing, if not "What's next? * Right now. In the moment." * There's people...ten years from now? * Same job, same place, same shit. * Everything the same; keepin' it safe. * Over and over and over and over... * "Ten years from now?" Man, you don't * know where you'll be...ten minutes * from now...tonight. * That's what he's saying. Open your * ears. You'll hear it...in his * "dialoguing" with the trumpet... *
WAITRESS	'Nother Vodka tonic, hon? CONTINUED: (2) 35
VINCENT	And one for my friend. Who's on the tenor sax? *
WAITRESS	That's Daniel, baby, he's the owner.
VINCENT	He is terrific. Would you be so kind * as to invite him over after his set? * I gotta buy him a drink. *
WAITRESS	Sure thing, darlin'...
DANIEL	...I was a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables. Right here. Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was. Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in. Mr. Louis Armstrong.
VINCENT	You're kidding me.
DANIEL	Right through those doors. The man himself.
VINCENT	Jesus...
DANIEL	He was in town playing two gigs a night at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel... After his last set, he decides to come on down to South Central to hang with his people. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot who we was. Money and fame an' all that? Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn. CONTINUED: (3) 35
DANIEL (CONT'D)	So before you know it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
VINCENT	Was it great? Better than great, it had to be...
DANIEL	Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling.
VINCENT	You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?
DANIEL	Did better'n that.
VINCENT	No.
DANIEL	Oh, my, yes.
VINCENT	C'mon...
DANIEL	Fella owned this place back then, cat * named Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis * that I played. So Pops, he just waves me right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
VINCENT	Unbelievable... ...you hearing this?
MAX	How'd you do?
DANIEL	How do you think? You ain't shit when you playing next to Louis Armstrong. But, Dippermouth, he was kind. He could see me trying. He carried my ass as best he could. CONTINUED: (4) 35
VINCENT	Remember what you played?
DANIEL	Most vividly. "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..." ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
VINCENT *	Whipped dog? *
DANIEL *	Whipped dog on a wet night. *
VINCENT *	Crowd dig it? *
DANIEL	The crowd was most kind. I was born in 1945, but that was the moment of my conception. Right here in the used-to-be crowded room. *
VINCENT	Crowds not here now?
DANIEL	Oh, jazz ain't the draw it used to be.
VINCENT	But the place looks great.
DANIEL	Only 'cause I got the wherewithal to * finance keepin' it up on my own. *
VINCENT	What a great story. I'll tell the * folks in Culiacan and Bogota that story. CONTINUED: (5) 35
DANIEL	You know the people in Culiacan and Bogota?
VINCENT	'Fraid so. CONTINUED: (6) 35
DANIEL	And here I thought you were such a cool guy.
VINCENT	I am a cool guy. With a job I was hired to do. You know how it is.
MAX	Let him go, Vincent.
VINCENT	I'm working here.
MAX	You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
VINCENT	Improvisation? That's funny from you. * Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question?
DANIEL	What question?
VINCENT	Jazz question. You get it right, we roll. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
DANIEL	How do I know you'll keep your word?
VINCENT	I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied?
MAX	No. No. He hasn't lied... * CONTINUED: (7) 35
DANIEL *	Means you're a man who lives on * reputation. I will take your word. And I will give you mine. If I walk out of here tonight, I'd go so far away, it'd be just like I was dead.
DANIEL (CONT'D)	And one more thing. Those guys and * their man, here, what's his name, * Felix? *
VINCENT *	Yeah. *
DANIEL *	Tell them, if by some chance I get * this wrong...you tell them I had to. * They laid a grant of immunity on me. * So it was flip and play ball or go * back inside. I ain't goin' back * inside.
VINCENT	Sure. *
DANIEL	Lay it on.
VINCENT	It's simple. What was Louis' first musical instrument?
DANIEL	I know all there is to know about Louis.
VINCENT	Then let's have it. CONTINUED: (8) 35
MAX	It was a trumpet! Wasn't it? Wasn't it a trumpet?
DANIEL	Coronet. Bought it from a New Orleans pawnshop when he was a kid. CONTINUED: (9) 35
DANIEL (CONT'D)	Cost him five dollars. Got a two- * dollar advance on his salary from a fine Jewish family he worked for, saved up the rest.
VINCENT	Tin horn. Cost him a dime. Rode the junk * wagon and played for the neighborhood. People sold them stuff. Rags. Bottles. Whatever.
VINCENT	Let's go.
MAX	No.
VINCENT	What you mean, no?
MAX	I'm done. Find another cab. CONTINUED: 36
VINCENT	Max?
MAX	Leave me alone. I'm collateral anyway, so do it and * stop making me a part of this! * I don't wanna know you!
VINCENT *	I'm not playing.
MAX	You played him, man. * He got the answer right, would you * have let him go?
LENNY (FILTERED)	Max? Maaax. Pick up, you dipshit.
VINCENT	What is it with this guy?
LENNY (FILTERED)	Maaaaaax!
VINCENT	You hassling my man again?
LENNY	Who are you? CONTINUED: (2) 36
VINCENT	Same fare you talked to last time.
LENNY (FILTERED)	What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
VINCENT	We're gay lovers, what's it to you? * Nothing! Aside from every night Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow! May he come on the line, please.
VINCENT	Hang on. Carefully...
MAX	Yeah?
LENNY (FILTERED)	Your mother's calling every ten minutes. Why didn't he show? Are you * all right? Where are you?
VINCENT	Show for what?
MAX	Tell her I can't make it tonight, okay?
LENNY (FILTERED)	What am I, related to you? You tell her yourself!
VINCENT	Show up for what?
MAX	She's in the hospital. CONTINUED: (3) 36
VINCENT	You visit every night?
MAX	Yeah. What difference does it make?
VINCENT	Cause if you don't show it breaks a routine.
MAX	So?
VINCENT	So people start looking for you, this cab. That is not good. *
MAX	No. I can't take you to see my mother...
VINCENT	Since when was any of this negotiable?
VINCENT	Stay three paces in front of me and one to my left...
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Flowers?
MAX	Waste of money. Won't mean a thing to her. CONTINUED: 37
VINCENT	She carried you in her womb for nine months.
MAN'S VOICE	Hold, please...
FANNING *	Five. Thanks.
VINCENT	Having a good night?
FANNING *	Mezzo-mezzo. You?
MAX	Hi, Ma. CONTINUED: 40
IDA	I've been calling and calling. CONTINUED: (2) 40
MAX	I got caught up at work.
IDA	Why couldn't you call me on the telephone? I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened to you...
MAX	I brought you flowers.
IDA	What am I gonna do with flowers?
MAX	You're gonna cheer up.
IDA	How? By worrying... * ...that you spend money on * things...that all they're gonna do is * wilt and die?
MAX	See? I didn't buy 'em. He did. *
IDA	Who? Come in. What I got is not * contagious. * Why didn't you tell me we had company? * And what's your name? Sorry. My son is rude.
VINCENT	No harm done, madam.
IDA	You paid for my flowers? They're beautiful. Max, will you introduce us? CONTINUED: (3) 40
MAX	Mom, Vincent. Vincent, my mother, Ida.
VINCENT	I'm really happy to meet you, Mrs. * Rilke.
IDA	Oh, call me Ida. To what do we owe this pleasure?
VINCENT	Well, I was with Max when he got the call.
IDA	And you came all the way here to see me?
VINCENT	It's nothing.
IDA	Tell my son. You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to do anything.
VINCENT	Tell me about it.
IDA	You must be an important client of Max's.
VINCENT	Client? I like to think of myself as his friend. A mentor. *
IDA	Max never had many friends. Always talking to himself in the mirror... It's unhealthy.
MAX	Hey, mom. How many times do I have to ask you not to do that? CONTINUED: (4) 40
IDA	Do what?
MAX	Talk about me like...I'm...not...in the room, here.
IDA	What's he sayin'?
VINCENT	Ida, he says he's standing right here. * In the room. Here. *
IDA	Yesss, you are, honey. He's sensitive.
VINCENT	I know. But I'm sure you're proud of * him.
IDA	Of course I'm proud. You know, he started with nothing. Look at him today. Here. Vegas. Reno...
MAX	Mom, Vincent's not interested. Let's go.
VINCENT	No. I am interested. IDA What's your name, again? *
VINCENT	Vincent... CONTINUED: (5) 40
MAX	I came to see you. I saw you. You look fine. Let's go.
IDA	Limousine companies.
VINCENT *	Yeah? *
IDA *	He drives famous people around, you * know? *
VINCENT	Limousine companies? What an achievement...
IDA	Visit again? *
VINCENT	I'm only in town tonight. *
IDA	When you come back? *
VINCENT	Sure. I promise. *
IDA *	Well, nice to meet you, Vincent. *
So is the briefcase.	Vincent races out into... CONTINUED: 40B
VINCENT	Stop or I'll go back and kill her.
MAX	You'd do her a favor.
VINCENT	I'll tell her the truth! CONTINUED: (2) 40B
VINCENT	Don't! CONTINUED: 43
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Red-light-green-light, Max. CONTINUED: (2) 43
MAX	Bullshit.
VINCENT	What the fuck was that?
MAX	Jazz.
VINCENT	You are screwing...with my work! My * prep was in there. I'm coming up on number four. The night is no longer young. Are we getting adversarial? * Didn't know you could do that... Let's see what else you can do.
ATTENDANT	We've had three come in tonight. Two John Does. Maybe one's your guy.
FANNING	No. Not Ramone. CONTINUED: 44
FANNING (CONT'D)	Try that one.
FANNING (CONT'D)	No. Next...
ATTENDANT	That's what's funny. These three came in within half an hour of each other. And the kid and that last guy (number 4)...they were done by the same shooter.
FANNING	Why do you say that?
ATTENDANT	Same wound pattern. Two in the sternum. One in the head. Add this cat's shooting tight groups. Double taps are a couple millimeters apart.
FANNING	...yeah, I'm still at MLK. The John Doe doesn't pan out. Not Ramone. But you'll never guess who else is in the meat locker.
WEIDNER *	Elvis Presley? CONTINUED: 45
FANNING *	Sylvester Clarke. Criminal-lawyer turned lawyer-criminal? CONTINUED: (2) 45
WEIDNER	"Sly" to his clients...
FANNING	...including my high-diving informant, Ramone, who he represented, who's still missing. Both of whom were in the exotic-substances business...
WEIDNER	Ramone and "Sly" Clarke in one night?
FANNING	In one night. Something bad is going down. And I don't think the Feeb know about it...
VINCENT	Limos, huh?
MAX	Don't start.
VINCENT	Hey, I'm not the one lying to my mother.
MAX	She hears what she wants to hear. I don't disillusion her.
VINCENT	Yeah, right. Maybe she hears what you tell her. CONTINUED: 46
MAX	Whatever I tell her's never good * enough. It's always been that way... My three older brothers...their wives made 'em move outta town.
VINCENT	You're goin' to a place called El Rodeo. It's on Whittier Boulevard in Anaheim.
MAX	Where on Whittier?
VINCENT	Look it up.
MAX	What's at El Rodeo?
VINCENT	Just drive. They project onto you their flaws, what they don't like about themselves, their lives, whatever. And then they rank on you, instead...
MAX	How do you know?
VINCENT	I had a father like that.
MAX	Mothers are worse.
VINCENT *	Mine died when I was one. *
MAX	What happened?
VINCENT	He hated whatever I did. Got drunk. Beat me up all the time.
MAX	Then what?
VINCENT	I killed him. I was 12. CONTINUED: (2) 46
VINCENT (CONT'D)	He was the first. I'm kidding. He died of liver cancer.
MAX	I'm sorry. CONTINUED: (3) 46
VINCENT	No you're not. So driving this cab "temporarily" is * all bullshit...?
MAX	It's not bullshit.
VINCENT	Twelve years is not temporary.
MAX	You gotta get cash together. Insurance, bond, maintenance, tires. Staff-up. Client lists. It's not get the car, put asses on seats.
VINCENT	Why not?
MAX	'Cause Island Limos will be more than a ride...like a club experience, a cool groove you don't want to end. Like that. So it's gotta be perfect. * Perfect.
VINCENT	Uh-huh.
MAX	Plus I got bills. She's been dying of the disease since I was in high school...
VINCENT	Here's good.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Gimme your wallet.
MAX	Why? CONTINUED: 48 CONTINUED: (2) 48
VINCENT	I'll hold it for you in case they search you.
MAX	In case who searches?
VINCENT	The people inside. Go in and ask for Felix. He's expecting you.
MAX	Felix? Okay. What's he look like?
VINCENT	Dunno. Never met him.
MAX	Who is he?
VINCENT	He's from who hired me.
MAX	I don't get it.
VINCENT	You destroyed my work-ups. And number four is due. Whatta you think, night's over? Called on account of rain? Go be me. In there. Score the * backups. He'll have 'em on a flash drive or CD...
MAX	Why don't you go? * Why me? I can't. VINCENT They don't know what I look like. And * I don't meet people. Like in risk * management. Protect anonymity. And you're not going to screw that up.
MAX	How'm I gonna be you? CONTINUED: (3) 48
VINCENT	Max, who's SoCal Cab Company? Ralph SoCal?
MAX	No.
VINCENT	Ever met the owner? *
MAX	No.
VINCENT	Well, I don't work for them. I work for their bosses. They don't get to meet me, either.
MAX	If...if I don't pull it off...?
VINCENT	They're gonna kill you. * You got ten minutes. 10:01? I drive the cab to the hospital and execute your mother on my way out of town...and don't pretend indifference.
MAX	I can't do this.
VINCENT	You threw my PC onto the freeway. You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
MAX	If I pull it off, it's gonna get other people killed...
VINCENT	Out of options, Max. Take comfort in * knowing you never had a choice.
MAX	Uh, how long you been doin' this? *
VINCENT	Why?
MAX	In case he asks.
VINCENT	Private sector? Six years. CONTINUED: (4) 48
MAX	You get benefits?
VINCENT	No. Nor paid sick leave. Quit stalling. Get out of the cab. Who is this?
FED #2 (O.S.)	Not Julio Iglesias...
AGENT #1 (O.S.)	Mark the time. CONTINUED: 51 Yeah. CONTINUED: (2) 51
MAX	Uh, hi...
MAN #2	Que pasa? Wha's up, homes?
MAX	I'm here to see Felix. He has something for me.
MAN #2	Don't know no Felix.
MAX	Uh. Say...say it's Vincent. I'm Vincent.
WEIDNER	Lt. Richard Weidner. LAPD. Major Narcotics Division.
FANNING	Detective Ray Fanning. LAPD. Major Nar...
PEDROSA	Yeah, hi, okay. Agent Frank Pedrosa.
WEIDNER	Thanks for seeing us...
PEDROSA	Yeah. You're welcome. How can I help? What's up? Why do you wanna know about our case?
FANNING	Has there been any unusual activity tonight?
PEDROSA	As in... CONTINUED: 52
FANNING	As in a murder or maybe a murder spree in Wilshire Central.
PEDROSA	All quiet on the western front. Various people are asleep. Various people are not. They come and go in cars, pickups and taxis. Other than that, we're watching air move. ...your interest in our case?
FANNING	Hood's all beat to shit.
PEDROSA *	On what?! *
FANNING *	On that. * CONTINUED: (2) 52
WEIDNER *	What's the license number?
FELIX	I thought you'd be taller.
FELIX (CONT'D)	Anyway I look at this, I see only one thing. I see one thing with you. Here. Tonight. I see trouble.
FELIX	So. Vincent. Explain...
MAN #2	Don't know no Felix.
MAX	I'm Vincent... CONTINUED: 54
FED #3	Did he say "Vincent?"
FELIX	Vincent don't meet people. The jefes * in Culiacan, Bogota, maybe. But he * won't talk to you. But, now you are * here. Okay. Why?
MAX	I lost my stuff.
FELIX	"Stuff"? Your "stuff"?
MAX	Yeah.
FELIX	I want you to listen to me real well. Special teams put together that list * of..."dedos." *
MAX	Dedos?
FELIX	Fingers. Informants. * Signal intercepts, voice-recognizing * software, surveillance...very * expensive counterintel produced that * list. * An important list, wouldn't you say? And you "lost" it?
MAX	I'm sorry.
FELIX	Sorry? Sorry does not put back together again Humpty Dumpty... CONTINUED: 55
FELIX (CONT'D)	Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
MAX	No.
FELIX	Do you believe in Santa Claus?
MAX	No.
FELIX	Neither do I. But my children do. They are still small. But do you know who they like even better than Santa Claus? His helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter. There's an old Mexican tale that tells of how Santa Claus got so very busy looking out for the good children that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children. So he hired Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a list with all the names of all the bad children, and Pedro would come every night to check them out. And the people, the little kids that were misbehaving, that were not saying * their prayers, Pedro would leave a little wooden donkey on their windows. And he would come back and if the children were still misbehaving, he would take them away and nobody would ever see them again. Now, if I am Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do you think jolly old Santa Claus would feel if one day Pedro came into his office and said, 'I lost the list.'? How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa Claus would get?!
FELIX (CONT'D)	So tell me, Vincent. Tell me what you think.
MAX	I think... CONTINUED: (3) 55
FELIX	What?
MAX	I think... ...I think you should tell the man behind me to put that gun away.
FELIX	What did you say?
MAX	I said. Tell him to put the gun away. Before I take it and beat his bitch * ass to death with it.
MAX (CONT'D)	I picked up a tail.
FELIX	Federal?
MAX	You tell me. How do I know? So I tossed the list and work-ups to protect...in part... ...your Hermes, Facconable sorry ass.
MAX (CONT'D)	You think I like comin' here? Like I got stupid all of an instant? Shit happens. You gotta roll with it. Darwin. I Ching...
FELIX	Has, uh...
MAX	The fat man. The penthouse guy. The jazz man. It leaves two.
FELIX	Can you finish? CONTINUED: (4) 55
MAX	In six years, have I ever not?
PEDROSA	...are you telling me Ramone Gallardo and Sylvester Clarke were murdered tonight? Both killed...?
FANNING	...Sylvester for sure, Ramone...
WEIDNER	We got another D.O.A. One "Daniel Baker" in South Central...
FED #3	That's three? He killed three in one night?
WEIDNER	Three what?
PEDROSA	Three witnesses. For a secret grand jury, secret my ass...
FANNING	So who's left? Before you lose them, too...
FELIX	The last two... CONTINUED: 57
FELIX (CONT'D)	Do not fail.
MAX	I never do. CONTINUED: (2) 57
MAX (CONT'D)	And as a token of appreciation...I want to offer you a discount. Yeah. All my services, here, tonight... Twenty-five percent off.
FELIX	Twenty-five?
MAX	Hell, make it fifty.
FELIX	Very generous.
MAX	By the way. Daniel said he was sorry.
FELIX	Go to Fever. He's met me. If it begins to go wrong, close his eyes. He cannot fall into their hands...
ALL THE FEDS	...his face, make sure you get his face...Vincent the ghost...too grainy, too much noise...plus twelve dB of gain, you get noise or you get no image...you getting this? ...yeah... CONTINUED: 59
FANNING	...yeah, uh-huh...African-American, medium build, dark hair...are you sure?
PEDROSA	LA101 to chase units... I want a three-car revolving tail on that cab. * LA102 is on him, now, at El Rodeo. We * will do a take-down of the cab with Vincent in it before he gets where * he's going. Locate our witness, Peter Yip...wife, * girlfriends, mommy, daddy, whatever. * Get him evacuated. Get him safe. * On the cab, the assault team, when * they are in place, will do the take- * down. Do NOT spook him before. I want Air Support up and to maintain at 1,500 feet.
FANNING	E-mail me his license. Okay? I'll wait... Anybody else in that cab?
VINCENT	Vegas odds would have compelled a "don't pass" bet on you walking out of there...
MAX	...I'm very impressed. CONTINUED: 60 CONTINUED: (2) 60
VINCENT	Washington Boulevard. After-hours dance club near Crenshaw called "Fever." Know it?
MAX	Twelve minutes.
VINCENT	You'll be late. Jump on the freeway * and get me to the 105 west. *
MAX	Why?
VINCENT	Do it.
FANNING	...according to the cab company's dispatcher, this cabbie's been driving that cab for twelve years...
PEDROSA	So what?
FANNING	...so, you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and, shazaam, changes into a meat-eater, super- assassin? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
PEDROSA	No. Cabdriver Max is floating down a storm drain. He is stuffed in the trunk of a cab. He is being devoured by flesh-eating stretococcus... CONTINUED: 62
FANNING	The guy, who walked out, looks like this guy...!
PEDROSA	'Cause he picked a cabdriver who looks like him...
FANNING	What's Vincent look like?
PEDROSA	Who knows. He's a ghost... Vincent's not even his name.
FANNING	I don't know...
PEDROSA	We do. We see private-sector security working for cartel groups in Colombia, Russia, Mexico...hiring ex-Special Forces types, ex-KGB all the time...
PEDROSA	Guys with trigger time, skill * sets...real tradecraft... * ...like, look like a "cabdriver." What are you gonna do?
PEDROSA	Take down his ass. Save our witness.
FANNING	What if they're wrong?
WEIDNER	The guy identified himself as "Vincent" and just met with the bad people! CONTINUED: 63
FANNING	Bullshit. There is something else going on.
WEIDNER	It's not our game!
FBI AGENT #3	I follow him up there...we blow the * tail! *
VINCENT	Let's go. CONTINUED: 66A
FBI AGENT #4	LA103 to LA101. Pedrosa, Pedrosa... Air support...
FBI AGENT #3	LA103 to Air 4...you still have him?
HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)	Air 4 to LA103. I lost him. You're in controlled air space. I gotta stay out until I get clearance from LAX tower...
FBI AGENT #4	Pedrosa...! CONTINUED: 67
PEDROSA	...you lost him? He can head anywhere out of LAX. North or south on the 405, east on the 105, the 110...
PEDROSA (CONT'D)	They locate Peter Yip?
FED #1	On with the wife. She thinks he's at Fever. They called. Can't get through.
PEDROSA	Washington and Crenshaw. Move! LA101 to LA103, LA104, LA105. Fever. After-hours club on 2407 Washington, near Crenshaw. Pico Union. Hit it!
LA105 (O.S.)	LA105 to LA101. Copy that.
VINCENT	Would you have called her? CONTINUED: 67A
MAX	Who?
VINCENT	Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Or was she just being polite?
MAX	I don't know.
VINCENT	Why hold back? Why not act off your impulse? Pick up the phone?
MAX	All I owe a fare is a ride, Vincent. CONTINUED: (2) 67A
VINCENT	It's not what you owe me. Time is fleeting. Life is short. Time is luck. One day it's gone... You make it out of this alive, you should call her. That's what I think...anyway...
PEDROSA	There...!
PEDROSA	We get Yip out. You take Vincent. * Clean shots! Watch your backgrounds.
VINCENT	Booth towards the back. That's where he hangs. Fat Korean guy. Terminal acne as a youth. You go first. CONTINUED: 81 Fifteen feet in front and three to my left. Wander, and innocent bystanders get the first rounds. Clear? CONTINUED: (2) 81 CONTINUED: 82C CONTINUED: (2) 82C unconsciousness...

MAX	Oh, man, am I happy to see you! I don't believe it!
FANNING	Yeah. I know. Relax. Breathe. You're okay.
MAX	I can't believe it. I can't believe it...!
VINCENT	GET IN! CONTINUED: 84 DRIVE!
VINCENT	What a clusterfuck. Only thing didn't show up was the Polish cavalry. You don't wanna talk, tell me to fuck off...
MAX	...fuck off. ...blood, bodily fluid and death get to you? Try deep breathing. Or remember, we all die anyway... You had to kill Fanning?! CONTINUED: 86A
VINCENT (O.S.)	Who's Fanning? *
MAX	That cop! Why'd you have to do that? You couldn't wound him? The guy had a family, maybe parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was a good guy, and he believed me...
VINCENT	I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you...?
MAX	No, not just that.
VINCENT	Yeah, that...
MAX	Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
VINCENT	It's what I do for a living...
MAX	Some living.
VINCENT	Head downtown...
MAX	What's downtown?
VINCENT	How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.
MAX	One more.
VINCENT	There you go...!
MAX	Whyn't you kill me and find another cab. CONTINUED: 86B
VINCENT	'Cause you're good. We're in this together. You know...fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence. All that crap...
MAX	You're full of shit.
VINCENT	I'm full of shit? You're a monument of it. You even * bullshitted yourself, all I am is taking out the garbage. Bad guys killing bad guys...
MAX	'Cause that's what you said...
VINCENT	And you believe me...?
MAX	What'd they do?
VINCENT	How do I know? But, they all got that "witness for * the prosecution" look to me. It's probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted... I dunno.
MAX	That's the reason?
VINCENT	That's the "why." There is no reason. No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.
MAX	Then what are you?
VINCENT	...indifferent.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	Get with it. Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us. Lost in space. The universe don't care (about you). The cop, you, me? Who notices?
MAX	What's with you...? *
VINCENT	As in...?
MAX	Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said: "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person across the street, there, what they think, who they are, how they feel, or I will kill you"...they'd have to kill you...wouldn't they...? 'Cause you don't have a clue...about...anyone. * ...I don't think you, you have a clue, * period. Did anyone "do" for you in your life...? Ever? When you draw breath in the morning? Open your eyes in the a.m.? You anticipate...anything? Want anything? Expect anything? I don't think so... 'Cause you are low, my brother, way low... and some standard parts that are supposed to be there?...with you, aren't. So what happened to you, man? What happened to you?
VINCENT	...all the cabbies in LA, I get Max, Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth...
MAX	Answer the question.
VINCENT	Look in the mirror.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	...with your paper towels...a bottle * of 409...a limo company someday. How much you got saved?
MAX	None of your business.
VINCENT	Your business "plan?" Someday? "Someday my dream'll come..."? And one night you'll wake up and discover it all flipped on you. Suddenly you're old. And it didn't happen. And it never will. 'Cause you were never going to do it, anyway. The dream on the horizon became yesterday and got lost. Then you'll bullshit yourself, it could never have been, anyway. And you'll recede it into memory...and zone out in a Barcalounger with daytime TV on for the rest of your life... Don't talk to me about killing. * You're do-in' yourself. In this yellow-and-orange prison. Bit by bit. Every day.
VINCENT (CONT'D)	All it ever took was a down payment on a Lincoln Town Car. What the hell are you still doing in a cab?
MAX	'Cause I never straightened-up and looked at it, you know...?
VINCENT	Slow down.
MAX	...myself, I should have. My brothers did... Tried to gamble my way out from under. (That was) Another born-to-lose deal! Then, "it's gotta be perfect to go!" You know? Risk all torqued-down. But you know what? It doesn't matter. What's it matter, anyway? 'Cause we are...insignificant out here in this * big-ass nowhere. Twilight Zone shit. * Says the badass sociopath in my backseat. So that's one thing I got to thank you for, bro... Until now, I never saw it that way...
VINCENT	That was a red light!
MAX	...not until now. So what's it all matter? It don't. Fuck it. Fix it. Nothing to lose. Right?
VINCENT	Slow the hell down!
MAX	Why? What are you gonna do? Pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot...my ass.
VINCENT	Slow down!
MAX	Vincent?
MAX (CONT'D)	Go fuck yourself. CONTINUED: 87
VINCENT	Well. That was brilliant.
MAX	Was your seatbelt fastened, honey? CONTINUED: 87A
SERGEANT	12A75 requesting an RA unit at Grand and 9th for a TC with injuries...
SERGEANT (CONT'D)	Are you alright? What happened? You've been in an accident. An ambulance is on the way to help you. Do you understand what I am saying to you? Sit down on the curb. Okay? Anybody else in there?
SERGEANT (CONT'D)	Don't worry about the cab. They'll get you a new one. You okay? *
MAX	I'm...fine. Fine. Just dizzy and * shit. *
SERGEANT	Sit there and breathe deep, sir. * You'll be okay. *
SERGEANT (CONT'D)	Put your hands where I can see 'em! Get on your knees! Slowly!
MAX	Huh?
MAX	Sure. Arrest me. Take me in. Police station. LA County's good. CONTINUED: 87C
MAX (CONT'D)	Get your hand off your gun!
MAX (CONT'D)	Look, someone's gonna get killed if I * don't, it's... *
SERGEANT	PUT YOUR GUN DOWN!
MAX	NO! I gotta go, see, you don't... *
SERGEANT	PUT THE GUN DOWN!
MAX	HEY, HEY! When did this become a negotiation?
MAX (CONT'D)	Cuff yourself to the goddamn door. CONTINUED: (2) 87C
SERGEANT	You're in a world of shit...
MAX	Good! Do us a favor. Call the police! I'm going to 6th and Fig. * I got no time to explain... *
