OFF HARRY	I always wanted to be another person, to be someone beside myself. To dispose of a single identity didn't seem enough. Living a single life wasn't enough for me. And half-joking, I came up with a pseudonym for myself, Harry Caine, an adventurer who, as fate would have it, became a writer. At that time, I had him author all the scripts and stories that I wrote. I came up with a standard biography to fill the back flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double. A self-made man, active and attractive like an English spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years, Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person, me, but a time came when, all of a sudden, I couldn't be anyone other than Harry Caine. I became my pseudonym. (He applies lotion in front of the mirror, reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not left). Just as I had planned, a heterodox writer and, never better stated, a self-made man, one might even say, "self-written man". There was only one detail I had not foreseen, Harry would be a blind writer. 3. IMAGES THAT ACCOMPANY THE VOICE -OFF.

JUDIT	I agreed to deliver the definitive version to the producer and director today.
HARRY	You will have it by tomorrow, don't worry.
HARRY	Ernesto Martel has died.
JUDIT	I think he was very ill...

HARRY	You'll have it by tonight, don't worry.
JUDIT	Start thinking of the next script. Some kind of horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers. It's what sells best ...
HARRY	I don't know if I'll know how to. I was thinking of developing a story inspired by Arthur Miller's son...
JUDIT	Yes... After Marilyn he married the photographer Inge Morat and they had a son. He was born mentally handicapped and Arthur Miller hid him; he doesn't even mention him in his memoirs. He never recognized him publicly. From the moment he was born, he had him placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of lived in an apartment with other friends and he found a job as a clerk in a supermarket...
JUDIT	And Miller never saw him? ...
HARRY	(Continues, his back turned) One day, Miller was giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded man, who had been condemned to death, after what was believed to be a forced confession. Among those present was his mentally handicapped son, who was integrally involved with organizations that aided all sorts of disabled people. The son was very proud to finally be sharing something with his father. At the held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine, it would not have been politically correct, least of all given the situation in which Miller found himself. Then the stranger let go of him and told him: "I am your son, Daniel, and I am very proud of you, Father!" This was the only time father and son saw each other.
JUDIT	(Somewhat tense) It's very moving, but I don't think we can write a script about Arthur Miller without procuring rights from the family.
HARRY	We change the names, the story is not about the writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the toward the father who has ignored him his entire life. goodness. There aren't those many good men that one can write about. Judit would like to say that when she spoke of a commercial script
JUDIT	It's a beautiful story. But years ago, when you began writing again and I began selling your scripts, you told me you'd never write remakes, sequels, nor biopics. Nor stories whose protagonists were film directors, handicapped or blind. I remember clearly
HARRY	I can't bear them... (As if he had at that very moment remembered) It's true, it's true I said all that, but this wouldn't exactly be a biopic...

HARRY	switched genres, perhaps he wasn't skilled for comedy). But tell me about the story you want to write. Ray X measures his words, it's very important to him and he doesn't
RAY	... I would like to write a story about a son's revenge, one against the memory of his father.
HARRY	Why does the son desire revenge?
RAY	(Speaking personally) Because the father ruined his life, practically nullifying him while he lived. The father is a successful financier, violent, homophobic, very powerful and unscrupulous. He thinks everyone has a price and that's how he behaves with people. I don't know if you've had the misfortune of meeting someone like this... Harry does not allay his doubt.
HARRY	When you say he is powerful, what kind of power are you referring to?
RAY X	Economic, with everything that entails. He is a broker, of the generation of speculators that made quick, high-profit gains in the 80s; he amassed a great fortune during the oil crisis. The son is sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations, and lives under his shadow, trying to please the father in everything. Despite being a bit... homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the father, and, just like him, he separates. He has a son that hates him just as much as he hates his own father. When the father dies, the son is finally able revenge.
HARRY	I get it. I am afraid I am not the writer you are looking for.
RAY X	You are, you don't know how much!
RAY X	I will pay whatever you ask.
HARRY	It's too personal.
RAY X	Make it yours. I am not aiming for a biopic, rather, I think of it as a base from which to develop a fiction.
HARRY	Thanks, but no. (He rises) And now, if you don't mind... Ray X will not give up, so he writes his telephone number on a piece
RAY X	There you have my phone number, if you change your mind. Ray gets up.
RAY X	I am sure we will see each other again.
HARRY	In my case, that would be a miracle.
HARRY	Did you overhear that?
DIEGO	Yes... I'm flipping out! Why did he ask you if Mateo had died? To provoke me... I don't know... Help me find something... (he points toward the drawers at the bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to open one of them) Look inside that drawer.
HARRY	Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot. Some of the photographs must have the date on it. He shuffles through them, until he pauses at one.

DIEGO	Of course. That's one of the problems, the couple desire each other desperately. But when it comes to fucking, she becomes prudish...
HARRY	Why?
DIEGO	Because she is afraid of losing control in her excitement and taking a bite into his jugular...
HARRY	Aha.
DIEGO	When they're horny, she lets him do everything, front,
HARRY	And her breasts?
DIEGO	Also... But that gets into high-risk territory. When with a pillow, which she ends up shredding with her
HARRY	And when she sucks his dick? No, no sucking. She would tear it on the first bite.

HARRY	(Anxious) I am here to see Diego Garcia. He's just been admitted. The "receptionist" looks through the admittances. Taking into account Shortly thereafter, the Doctor appears. He heads directly for Harry.
HARRY	I am here to see Diego Garcia.
DOCTOR	Are you immediate family?
HARRY	(Improvises) Yes... I'm his uncle, and his godfather.
DOCTOR	Your nephew is at the ICU, he arrived in a coma...
HARRY	In a coma?
DOCTOR	Yes...
HARRY	But, what has happened?!
DOCTOR	He ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol... it is a lethal
HARRY	My God! But Diego is a very healthy boy... Barring any complications, he will recover in six to twelve hours.
HARRY	If that's the case, I'll wait...
DOCTOR	Go home, we will call you...
HARRY	I'd rather wait.
DOCTOR	Are you certain?
HARRY	Yes. Guide me to a place where I can sit, please...
DOCTOR	Would you mind providing us with his parents' phone
HARRY	He only has a mother and, at the moment, she is working outside Madrid... I would prefer to call her myself... I don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly in a grave condition...
DOCTOR	Normally, he should recuperate in a few hours... but, in any case, you should have a talk with him, once he's better...
HARRY	Yes, of course... They arrive at a couch set, ugly and lacking style, Harry collapses on The Doctor returns to work. The girl at the reception desk stares at Harry, who is immobile, A slow fade to black. Harry is still waiting, this time at home, sitting on a wingback chair On the nightstand, there are some medications and a glass of water, To his surprise, Harry asks him:
HARRY	How are you? Diego makes a listless gesture.
DIEGO	I don't know... dazed. Did you speak with my mother? Yes, I told her it was something you ate...
DIEGO	And she believed it?
HARRY	I don't know. She wanted to hurry back, but I convinced her to continue with the location scouting.
HARRY	Are you asleep?
DIEGO	I'm not sleepy anymore.
HARRY	Do you want to talk?
DIEGO	No...
HARRY	Would you like me to speak?
DIEGO	I don't know. If you'd like...
HARRY	I say so in order to distract you. When I was young, before I got into making movies, I was very good at telling stories.
DIEGO	(Not sure) Well, then... would you mind telling me why my mother is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?
HARRY	She's afraid of him?
DIEGO	Before she left, she made me promise that I would remain alert, in case he reappeared...
HARRY	She didn't explain why?
DIEGO	She never explains anything.
HARRY	It's a long story...
DIEGO	Judit says the same thing. How did you meet him?
HARRY	We met him... In an office we had rented in preparation
OFF HARRY	...After having written five dramas, I had finally managed to write a script for a comedy, or that's what I thought.

MATEO	And she's an actress?
JUDIT	(Ironic) Her? If she's been with him for three years, she must be. In any case, go out and say hello, to be polite. One must get along well with important men. You never know. Lena's back is turned, or her head is tilted as she reads a magazine. Mateo's heart churns, it's a cinematographic churn, he feels like Even though she's a bit nervous, one can tell that Lena is a strong Genres and their iconographies pose no limit on Mateo's capacity to be

LENA	I can come whatever day is convenient.
MATEO	You're already here. Let's read something. They disappear through Mateo's office door. Fade to black. The reading didn't work out. We were both too nervous.

LENA	Go see him, no?! Ernesto makes a gesture that betrays his anger and displeasure.
LENA	Please, Ernesto. I need to do something! And I've always wanted to be an actress!
ERNESTO S.	And what will become of me?
LENA	They have not given me the role yet.
ERNESTO S.	They will...!
LENA	Well, if I were to get it, we would still see each other every day, as it has been, in the mornings and evenings. Nothing will change, except that during the day I would work, just like you.
ERNESTO S.	Why don't we get married?
LENA	
ERNESTO S.	I am asking you to marry me...
LENA	Don't you think you've married and divorced enough times already? With you it'd be the first.
LENA	We've been living together for three years, aren't we fine like this?

HARRY	Ernesto Martel offered to produce the movie. Your mother didn't want him to.

CONTINUED OFF HARRY	As far as Ernesto Senior was concerned, (we observe him watching the projection uncomfortably) I've never known a man more obsessed with a woman, except myself. He was producing the film out of a desperate attempt to not lose Lena. In the middle of this emotional quagmire, we began shooting... Your mother was present at every instant, her face like a sergeant's. The look of Lena's character is openly inspired by the Audrey Hepburn IN STUDIO-MADE KITCHEN, INSIDE THE COMPLEX "PINA'S LOFT".

MATEO	No. You may go.
ERNESTO J.	I don't mind staying.
MATEO	It's best if you leave. I am going to try out some wigs. Wigs? I love wigs!
MATEO	(Categorically) No! You don't love them! You already have many hours shot of wigs. This is more of the same. Disappointed, Ernesto Junior says goodbye.
ERNESTO J.	And Lena?
MATEO	After she tries on the new wigs, she's asked for a
ERNESTO J.	Spasms... I don't have footage of spasms... Couldn't I shoot that?

MATEO	No. I sent him home. There's only Edurne, on watch...

LENA	(Smiles) Well, yes, especially if you're a girl. Why if you're a girl?
LENA	dress up, do your hair. Get dressed again, do your hair again. And that takes hours.
ERNESTO S.	And you're not tired?
LENA	At the end of the week, sure, but I'm happy...
ERNESTO S.	I was thinking we should take a break, a weekend. Just the two of us, alone. At the house in Ibiza, or in Paris... wherever you want... you and I.
LENA	I can't travel until the shoot is over...
ERNESTO S.	I am talking about just a weekend.

LENA	The movie is boss.
ERNESTO S.	Excuse me, I'm the producer, so I'm the boss. Mateo is going to go complain to her about the set, but he notices
MATEO	You look awful...
JUDIT	Little Diego... he could hardly breathe all night... neither of us has slept a wink.
MATEO	Some doctors say it's asthma, others that it's allergies, but we don't know to what... They are still
MATEO	Take all the time you need... Even if we're shooting, your son is more important.
JUDIT	Thanks. (Changing subjects) One more thing, I've talked to the producer.
MATEO	And?
JUDIT	He complains that the shooting is monopolizing Lena.
MATEO	(Exasperated and condescending) And how does he think one makes movies?
JUDIT	Ernesto is a businessman, not an artist.
MATEO	Then he shouldn't have signed up as a producer, no one asked him...
JUDIT	I warned you! Ernesto Martel doesn't give a crap about this movie and those of us making it, except for one person! This weekend he is taking her to Ibiza with him, so you won't be able to rehearse.
MATEO	Son of a bitch! After the final sprint, they both come, satisfied. Or so it seems. She opens the faucet and lets the water run. Immediately, she is overtaken by vicious retching. On her knees, she After she's done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the Have you put on makeup?

ERNESTO S.	(Smiles, like a champ) Six?
LENA	
ERNESTO S.	With honours, yes? Lena forces a smile, with her back to Ernesto.
LENA	Yes, I suppose so.
ERNESTO S.	We have to take advantage of our time. We only have one more day left. Chus stops her, almost by force. She is a very "communicative" woman Chus shows her both objects, with a questioning look on her face. Look at what I've found on the sidewalk, they fell from your terrace.
PINA	They are gifts from Mr. Ivan and I tossed them out.
CHUS	But you can't do that, Ms. Pina. You could have killed somebody... You can't just throw things off the terrace, much less if they are metal...
PINA	In Naples, on New Year's Eve, they even throw out furniture, my grandfather was Neapolitan... I carry it in my blood.
CHUS	But this is not Naples, nor is today New Year's Eve...
PINA	I was anxious and throwing things relaxes me... Keep them if you like.

HARRY	She was pissed, I suppose.
DIEGO	I remember that time, it was while I was undergoing treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis. It was a horrible time for me... Not just because of the illness, my mother was like a crazy woman... I had just seen "The Exorcist" and, for some time, I believed she was possessed...
HARRY	(Smiles pathetically) I was the demon, Diego. And I am sorry. I suppose I behaved selfishly, but I am not sure I had a choice... Diego thinks about this. she should have alerted you to what was happening.
HARRY	The fact is she never did, and we've never spoken of
DIEGO	(Surprised) And you weren't curious?...
HARRY	(Emphatically) Me? Curiosity was killing me! For two days I called both your mother and Luis non-stop, the editor (says it agitated), but neither of them answered! So I decided to return to Madrid the next day so that I could witness what was happening for myself! Mateo and Magdalena dine at "El Mirador," a local restaurant with There are few patrons inside the restaurant. Perhaps a foreign Lena appears melancholic and fearful.
MATEO	How did you meet Ernesto Senior?
MATEO	And... how did you end up with him? You fell in love?
LENA	He was very generous with me and my family. My father was dying, I needed to take him to a private Hospital and Ernesto took care of everything... He paid for everything... And he made sure that my parents could return to their home town and that they lacked nothing...
MATEO	(Lovingly) Pardon me, I have no right to ask you about that time in your life.
LENA	It's only natural that you would want to know. And I don't want any skeletons between us. (Unguarded) I would like to be able to forget all that, but you have the right to ask.
MATEO	(Assuring her) No. I do not have any right. For me, you were born the day you came for the audition. You looked at me, I saw your face and... I was left hypnotized. Lena smiles. She is both comforted and relived by remembering that I remember your face perfectly. I think I fell in love with the way you looked at me. I thought: this man will be my salvation.
LENA	
MATEO	(Pampering) Either way, I will return next weekend. But if you are going to be worried, you should come with me.
LENA	No... I will be better off here. 127. IN MOVEMENT. THE ISLAND, NIGHTTIME. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE Mateo's car once again heads for the bungalow complex. Show the
MATEO	(Very insecure) And did I manage to save you from anything?
LENA	(Enigmatic and unwavering) Yes! The camera only focuses on the sculpture, swaying in the wind. Magdalena's death didn't catch us melded in an embrace, surprise, in that of leaving me alive. Through one of the windows, we can see Mateo's gaunt and nebulous
JUDIT	Mateo, say something!
HARRY	Mateo is dead, Judit.
JUDIT	(Bags under her eyes and tearful) Don't say that! A naturalist décor and stage-setting of an island Hospital of that Other than the psychiatrist, there is another doctor present,
PSYCHIATRIST	We call him by his name, but he doesn't respond to it. He insists Mateo has died.
JUDIT	Images are the source of his work... and to live in the chance he will see?
DOCTOR	None. His is what we refer to as a cortical blindness, and it's irreversible. It's the result of visual information. In other words, the neurons have
OFF HARRY	I felt as though I had died with Lena. The Mateo- film-director who had left Madrid would never return.
MATEO	Did you visit Lena's mother at her hometown?
JUDIT	Yes.
MATEO	What did she say?
JUDIT	She was very thankful to Ernesto for having taken care of everything... That's it?
JUDIT	Yes, they buried her next to her father.
MATEO	Did you visit the grave?
JUDIT	Yes. Mateo nods in defeated acknowledgement. Judit and little Diego exit. Judit helps Mateo out.
JUDIT	What's wrong? (Weakened) You go... I can't... I'll wait for you on the beach.
DIEGUITO	I also want to go to the beach! Do whatever you need to do. We'll wait for you there.
JUDIT	Bundle up! And don't get too close to the water. (To little Diego) Don't let go of his hand! I am here to pay Mateo Blanco's bill.
EMPLOYEE	We don't have anyone here registered by that name.
JUDIT	It's the man who had the accident. He was in bungalow number two.
EMPLOYEE	Oh, you mean Harry Caine.
JUDIT	Yes, of course.
EMPLOYEE	Poor souls! They are not the first to have an accident on that traffic circle! Awful! Little Diego's voice distracts him.
DIEGUITO	Look... There are kites! Mateo is grateful for the life-affirming sound of the boy's voice and The wind's violent sweep over all the different elements that compose the embrace on Golfo Beach still rests, along with his notebook, blank Judit observes the photograph on Golfo Beach as if it were alive, Judit picks up all the pieces, slowly and delicately, and she places
JUDIT	Harry! Harry Caine!
HARRY	We're here, Judit! (And raises his hand like a child)
JUDIT	We have to go, Harry.
HARRY	(To the boy) Let's go, Dieguito. Give me your hand.
DIEGUITO	(Protests, politely) Can't we stay a little longer?
HARRY	No. We must obey your mother... You've had enough wind for one day...
DIEGUITO	But I'm already all better! Neither of the two men speak. Mateo remains seated at his desk.
HARRY	Play "Elevator to the Gallows" and take a look at the ending... While he looks for it...
DIEGO	Do you always watch the same movies?
HARRY	Yes. Since I know them by heart, I can visualize the action.
DIEGO	Is there any new movie you'd want to see...?
HARRY	Yes. But you'd have to describe the action. Your mother used to describe some to me, some time ago.
DIEGO	I wouldn't mind doing so.
HARRY	I would like to "watch" one by Tarantino or Scorsese, and also some Asian cinema...
DIEGO	Done. They pick a movie (chosen by Mateo). Diego hooks up the television, For Harry it is all a shock, there is not doubt that it is his film.
PINA	What a drag! (she opens, not very welcoming) Oh, it's you? RETURN TO 142. IN HARRY'S LIVING ROOM. 2008.
HARRY	That's "Girls and Suitcases"! Yes.
HARRY	Turn up the volume! Harry focuses on the sounds from the screen and Diego on everything 144. ON THE TELEVISION. 2008.
CHON	(Reproachful) I've left you a thousand messages.
PINA	Yes. A thousand from you, and none from Ivan.
CHON	Looks at it as if it were some strange insect.) And this suitcase?
PINA	It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.
CHON	And the cast on your leg?
PINA	His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the stairs and I broke my leg...
CHON	Wow! Well, we're in good shape... I also broke up with my husband...
HARRY	(Annoyed) They're terrible!
HARRY	How could I have thought these takes were the good ones! What was I thinking! He remains suspended for a few moments, as if trying to find an good or bad? Cut to. He opens the drawer with the photographs. (When Diego had opened it
HARRY	May I come in?
DIEGO	(Drying himself) Yes, come in!
HARRY	Luis, the editor, sent it to me six years ago. At that time I didn't even bother to open it, I didn't want to know anything about him. I am now thinking that perhaps he had something to tell me. Would you mind seeing if beyond the takes and all of that there is something else written?
DIEGO	At the end he says this is my new number, a number's written down. Harry hands him his mobile phone.
HARRY	Call him, please!
DIEGO	Right now? It's too early.
HARRY	It doesn't matter. Diego dials the number and hands the phone to Harry.
DIEGO	May I get dressed? I'm naked...
HARRY	Oh, I'm sorry. He turns around and leaves.
HARRY	(On the phone) Could I speak to Luis, please?
WOMAN'S VOICE	(Surprised) Luis died six years ago!
HARRY	Oh, I am so sorry... I had no idea!
VOICE	It was cancer. I'm his widow. Who are you?
HARRY	Mateo Blanco. Luis edited all my films...
VOICE	you. I am his second wife...
HARRY	The one I know is Nieves, the first one.
VOICE	We married twelve years ago.
HARRY	(Sincere and sorrowful) I am sorry to hear about Luis' death. I would have liked to speak to him...
VOICE	He would have liked so too! Once he was quite ill and didn't want to speak to anyone, he would always tell me that, if it was you, I should hand him the phone... You have no idea how sorry I am! Harry, heavy-hearted, approaches the kitchen, pensive. A half-hearted
DIEGO	What's going on?
HARRY	My editor. I just found out he died six years ago...
HARRY	Not long before he died he sent me this notebook. But I didn't want to know anything about him, I also didn't know he was dying... and I put it away... until today... His wife just told me he would have liked to speak to me, that was the purpose of sending me the notebook... but I didn't give him the chance.
DIEGO	Had you spoken since the accident? No. Never. Diego places plates with toast and juice on the table. He serves
DIEGO	The coffee is in front of you...
DIEGO	Are you OK? Would you like me to stay here?
HARRY	No, no... You're heading out?
DIEGO	My mother arrives today. I would like to be home when she arrives.
HARRY	I didn't know she was arriving...
DIEGO	I didn't either, she left me a message this morning. She's coming to celebrate your birthday, with us...
HARRY	It's my birthday?
DIEGO	It seems so. Today's the (he tells him the day), does that sound right?
HARRY	Yes. A day like today, fifty-one years ago, I entered the world.
JUDIT	I was dying to see you! Are you OK, my son?
DIEGO	Yes.
JUDIT	I was very worried about you!
DIEGO	Mateo has looked after me day and night...
JUDIT	Mateo? You're not calling him Harry...?
DIEGO	Yes... Today's his birthday, we must get him something... What have you been up to all this time?
DIEGO	Nothing... Watching movies... and talking...
JUDIT	(As if it were something strange) Talking?
DIEGO	Yes...
JUDIT	What about?
DIEGO	Mom, please!
JUDIT	OK. So what happened to you? (Sort of joking) I don't know if I should believe the thing about the stomach flu, you two used that as an excuse in a script...
DIEGO	rather not speak of that right now...
JUDIT	(Irritated, by the surprise) What kind of accident?
DIEGO	It's hard to explain.
JUDIT	(Orders him, annoyed) Try to! I am not that stupid! Let's leave it for another time, yes? I am all well now.
JUDIT	What's wrong with you, Diego?
DIEGO	Nothing. I'm doing just fine. I'm going to buy a present for Mateo.
JUDIT	
DIEGO	Alright, Harry.
JUDIT	Call him however you wish. That's the advantage of having two names.
JUDIT	Wait, my arms are full...
MATEO	Are those flowers?
JUDIT	Yes! Happy Birthday!
JUDIT	Thank you for looking after Diego... I don't know how to thank
MATEO	You've been looking after me for fourteen years now... I've found him somewhat hostile. He left without telling me what it was that happened... Will you tell me?
MATEO	I don't know. It should be your son to tell you.
JUDIT	What is wrong with the two of you? Why is it that he suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo?
MATEO	second one.) Two weeks ago, at the place where he D.J.'s, by mistake, he grabbed a friend's drink that had been spiked with G.H.B., liquid ecstasy. He thought it was his drink, both drinks had Coca-cola.
JUDIT	Liquid ecstasy?
MATEO	Yes. It's a very dangerous drug when it's mixed with alcohol and Diego had already had two Cuba Libres before he drank from his friend's glass...
JUDIT	And... what happened... exactly?
MATEO	(Being vague.) He was badly affected. He spent two days in urgent care, after that, I brought him here. Diego's a drug addict?
MATEO	No. I've told you, he drank from the glass containing liquid ecstasy by mistake...
JUDIT	But how can one make a mistake with something like that?
MATEO	At first glace one cannot tell the difference. Both glasses contained Coca-cola... It's not the first time it happens... Judit sighs, defenseless and horrified.
MATEO	Diego has not told you so that you wouldn't be alarmed...
JUDIT	(That I wouldn't be alarmed?!) Well, he hasn't succeeded. At some point he will have to speak to me, no?
MATEO	He is wanting to do so!
JUDIT	Is that so? Because I ask him and he doesn't answer!
MATEO	Then you should try answering him, when he asks you. Judit smokes in silence, she is curious to know what Mateo and Diego
JUDIT	The two of you are acting very differently. Both of you. You both have changed.
MATEO	You smell good...
JUDIT	(Insecure) I have put on some makeup and I am dressed as a woman.
MATEO	What's the dress like? And the hair? How are you wearing your hair? It's been so long since I've asked you that I don't even know whether it's long or short.
JUDIT	I haven't changed much, Harry. I am wearing my hair short.
MATEO	Short like Jean Seberg in "Breathless"? Like Joan of Arc on the bonfire? Like Liza Minnelli in "Cabaret"? Or like Yul Brynner?
JUDIT	Short, or rather, very short, like that of all fortysomethings who want to appear younger.
MATEO	I am sure it looks good on you. Thanks for dressing up for me, Judit... Near them, on the bar table, two couples talk excitedly as if they The restaurant is completely shrouded in darkness, all the waiters,
JAVIER	My name is Javier. How many are you?
MATEO	Three. There is not a single light inside. The following sequences take
JAVIER	Please, grab onto each other's shoulders and follow me in Indian-file. I will guide you to your table. It's number eight.
JUDIT	What is the idea here, Harry?
MATEO	We are dinning in darkness.
JAVIER	You didn't know this, ma'am?
JUDIT	
JAVIER	You should have been warned, but don't worry. People get used to it after a few minutes.
JAVIER	Imagine that your plate is the face of a watch. Your silverware is at 9h and at 3h. Your glass at 1h. Bread at 11h. Each of them reaches for the objects as indicated by the waiter around If she had been able to see, she would have been witness to the very
JUDIT	Harry, what is all this about?
JAVIER	We want our clients to discover that the lack of sight harnesses the other senses. Touch, taste, smell and sound will acquire a special intensity tonight, ma'am. I hope you'll enjoy them.
JAVIER	Will the gentlemen be drinking something?
MATEO	Bring us a bottle of wine, to toast. Slowly, Judit begins to walk the plank that will plunge her into I found out about this place in the newspaper and I wanted to check it out.
DIEGO	It's a German idea, there are various restaurant like this one, they're totally in fashion.
JUDIT	(Can't believe what she's hearing.) Darkness, in fashion? I don't understand. She lights a cigarette.
DIEGO	Let's toast!
JUDIT	Yes. Let's toast. Mateo pours the glasses. They each grab one. Clumsily, they bring
DIEGO	Happy Birthday!
JUDIT	Happy Birthday! We must look into each other's eyes.
DIEGO	Well, we're kind of screwed...
JUDIT	Oh, sorry... It slipped.
MATEO	Joy! Joy! (to Judit) Bring your ear to me so that I can sprinkle some wine behind it. It's for good luck! audience, witnessing a theatrical production. Although on this Judit sips-down the gin-and-tonic quite rapidly. Mateo and Diego Cut to.
JUDIT	I don't know what you've been talking about these past days... A topic which they have waited to broach since she arrived from her Neither of the two men respond, but they are both made uncomfortable But I do know what I haven't talked to you about all these years...
MATEO	I've never asked you...
JUDIT	But you must have asked yourself a thousand times. This is my birthday gift, Mateo. (To Diego) The gift is also for you, Diego.
JUDIT	thought only of his revenge. A plan had occurred to him but, to carry it out, he had to bribe, at the very sold ourselves without hesitation. Luis and I. With me, he had the courtesy to provide an alibi, he proposed that I leave for a month and a half to the United States, to the Mayo Clinic, so that Diego could undergo a cure for his aspergillosis, that way I wouldn't have to be present while he destroyed the movie (because that was his plan, to make a mess out of the film). I opted to stay in Madrid and have Diego undergo his cure here. I wanted to witness everything. If I was going to betray you, I wanted to pay the full price...
MATEO	What a living hell! For both of you!
DIEGO	You said it! She takes a deep breath and continues:
JUDIT	Yes. It was torture to watch Ernesto select the worst and jealousy. I couldn't take it and I couldn't (then) forgive you for having abandoned Cinearte with Lena without saying a word! My betrayal was my revenge against you, against her and against myself... The only son, for the bitterness that you've had to absorb all these years... no one deserves to grow up like this... With the glass in her hand, Judit returns to the table where Mateo and She has observed them whispering, but she hasn't heard what they have Judit takes a sip.
MATEO	(Interrupts her) Don't continue, Judit! It's not necessary.
JUDIT	Yes. Now that you once again call yourself Mateo, I have no excuse. Judit takes a sip from her drink, to gather her strength. No one knew where you were. We had no idea. Ernesto Senior put everything together, the premier, all that ruckus, to see if you'd react. His revenge was pointless if neither of you found out about it. (Pauses) Ernesto asked me constantly if I knew where you were, but I said that I also didn't know anything, which was true.
MATEO	(Somber) That's why I never called you, but even if you don't believe it, I was very worried for you and the boy.
JUDIT	I believe you... Diego attempts to say that he, too, believes him, but Judit doesn't
JUDIT	Ernesto hired various detectives to search for you, but before they found you, you called me, two days after the premier. (Slowly, debilitated.) I was too embarrassed to answer, and... too stunned. I still am. When Ernesto Senior asked me again about you, I don't know why, I gave him the phone number for Famara...
JUDIT	He was the one who found you after the accident and called the hospital...
DIEGO	Did he have something to do with the accident?
JUDIT	No! But I can't stop thinking that had I not given his father the phone number, perhaps nothing would have happened...
MATEO	
JUDIT	I don't know...
MATEO	yourself. He says this with spite and somewhat disparagingly. For Judit it's Never before has Judit felt Mateo this distant and antagonistic. Her and generated new suspicions. And Judit feels taken over by an arid
MATEO	Good night. (Destroyed) Good night. Call me if you need anything... Judit waits until she sees him disappear into the elevator. From Judit's point of view, Mateo disappears into the elevator, which Before she opens the door she bends over and retches violently. Judit's face is contorted. She wipes a thread of saliva still hanging
DIEGO	
JUDIT	It's a panic attack... (Takes a deep breath, as if she Diego looks at her, very concerned. His mother has never shown Judit attempts to smile in order to calm him.
JUDIT	I will sleep well with this...
DIEGO	Do you want me to stay here?
JUDIT	
DIEGO	In case the panic returns, so that you don't feel alone.
JUDIT	Thank you. I am feeling better... and I'll fall asleep soon.
DIEGO	Call me, if you are not feeling well... Standing over his desk, Mateo searches the desk drawer under the Mateo leaves him a message: "I am sorry to call you so early. Tell There are a few people on the sidewalk and those he crosses are all He greets him.
WAITER FRIEND	Why here so early?
MATEO	I couldn't sleep. Would you mind dialing this number? Judit looks over the culinary display.
JUDIT	How impressive!
DIEGO	I am specializing in breakfasts. I would do the same for Mateo... Judit's expression changes, now a bit more somber.
DIEGO	Are you OK?
JUDIT	Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last night. It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally and I know how to stop it...
DIEGO	It scared me, it seemed as though an alien would pop out of your stomach. It's not a bad way of describing a panic attack... decision before she arrived in the kitchen). Diego, there was one last thing I didn't tell you yesterday.
DIEGO	About Mateo?
JUDIT	Yes.
DIEGO	You can tell me some other time. Now it's time for breakfast.
JUDIT	If I don't tell you now, I may never do so... At the end of the eighties, in `77, to be exact.
DIEGO	The year of punk.
JUDIT	Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved...
DIEGO	In a love affair?
JUDIT	Yes... We were just getting started in film, and we are side... That didn't keep us from working together... until now...
DIEGO	I knew all that, or I imagined it...
JUDIT	There's one more thing... Mateo is your father... Diego looks at her, astonished.
DIEGO	And that fleeting lover, my supposed biological father? You made him up?
JUDIT	No... I... can hide things... but I never make things up... I don't know how to make up... The fleeting lover existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived. His name was Vicente and it was while I was with him that you were conceived, but your biological father was Mateo, not Vicente.
DIEGO	Mateo know?
JUDIT	No. At that time, he asked me and I denied it, of course. I didn't want to put pressure on him, I didn't want our relationship to change because of it. After all, I had never asked him if he wanted to become a father.
DIEGO	I see... If you think I made a mistake, don't tell me now. We have the rest of our lives for recriminations.
DIEGO	I will not recriminate you... I think I like being Mateo's son (the son of a bitch) ... Speaking of, he called early this morning...
JUDIT	Who?
DIEGO	Mateo. At 8h. She looks at the clock and it's 11h.
JUDIT	What did he want?
DIEGO	For you to call him as soon as you could.
JUDIT	(Surprised, tense) That I call him? Why in the world have you not awakened me?!
DIEGO	Because, after what happened last night, you needed to sleep. He didn't say it was urgent. You can call him now. Judit grabs her son's phone, agitated once again, and dials Mateo's
JUDIT	Diego has told me to call you. Are you OK? Do you need
MATEO	(Almost with irony) I am not alright, Judit. And yes, I do need something... The forty thousand meters of negative we shot during my last film in order to edit it... I am at the home of Ernesto Junior and I just found out the material was destroyed in '94. I imagined something like this, I just didn't think it would have happened that soon...
JUDIT	(With urgency) Let me explain...
MATEO	and I don't want to take it out on you!
JUDIT	Ernesto's house?
MATEO	I think I am going to bribe him. We need money, I don't want Diego back at that damn bar. I want to pay Diego a salary, we need money and he has money to throw... Ernesto looks at Mateo fearlessly, he is still determined to search,
JUDIT	Mateo, stop talking crazy!
MATEO	It is not craziness. I can't think of anyone else to blame for Magdalena's death.
JUDIT	My God! (She asks Diego to bring her the box of tranquilizers.) Wait a second... I have something to tell you.
MATEO	Let it be, you already said enough last night. dominant.) I was the production director, if you want to know anything about the footage, ask me!
MATEO	Since you insist, I will ask you. What do you have to tell me?
JUDIT	In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be destroyed.
MATEO	In '94! Very shortly after the release of that aberration.
JUDIT	Yes. In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of all the material... and that was many years ago.
MATEO	That's not anything that I don't already know.
JUDIT	As the film's producer I was the only one who had access to the lab... to all the material. After I gave the order to have everything destroyed, I intercepted it. And I kept it. I have all of it at home.
MATEO	You are lying to me.
JUDIT	I didn't tell you this last night because I didn't realize you wanted to edit it. I took everything, all the double takes, the internegative, the sound tapes... Everything! You can have it whenever you want! That changes everything.
JUDIT	alone. He had nothing to do with this.
MATEO	I am not so sure. He has yet to explain what he was doing in Lanzarote. I'll let you go, it seems he wants to talk... (Hangs up) Here is a copy of "the making of".
MATEO	And why would I want that? I can't watch it! Plus, I'm not interested.
ERNESTO J.	Have someone you trust watch it and tell you about it. accident.) Oh, and even if my father had asked me to harm you, I never would have... You are very important to me, Mateo... Ernesto speaks naturally, for the first time, Mateo takes him At the last moment, an instant prior to being struck by the SUV, Mateo Diego has just watched the kiss and the accident. He rewinds and he
MATEO	Is there something new I should know about?
DIEGO	documentary... And, yes, in effect, Ernesto followed
MATEO	The images are there? Yes.
MATEO	Those of the last night?
DIEGO	Yes. He recorded you at a safe distance, while you were on you way back after dinner. The scene is lit enough to see what happened. Not only did he not have anything to do with the accident, he saved your life.
DIEGO	And one more e thing: When you were at the traffic circle, before the SUV crashed into to you, you and Lena kiss...
MATEO	A kiss? I don't remember it...
DIEGO	It was an ordinary kiss, just one more of the many kisses a couple gives each other, almost without thinking...
MATEO	Yes. Even if it sounds cheesy, someone has to tell you: Lena did not die in your arms, as you dreamed, but the last sensation she experienced in this world was the taste of your mouth...

CHON	(Anxious, reproachful.) I have left you a thousand messages!
PINA	Yes. A thousand from you and none from Ivan.
CHON	strange bug.) What about this suitcase!
PINA	It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.
CHON	And that cast on your leg?
PINA	His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the stairs...
CHON	Well, we're in good shape! I've also broken up with my husband... Oh, sorry to hear it! I will make some coffee, I have spent my entire night looking for Ivan and I haven't gone to bed.
CHON	Neither have I. On her way to the kitchen Chon notices, through the bedroom door, that
PINA	When did you leave him?
CHON	Four days ago. I could see it coming. The thing is that after breaking up, I go out onto the street and I
CHON	(Voracious.) Oh my, gazpacho! Can I have a bowl? No! I've spiked it with an entire box of downers...
CHON	How so?
PINA	In case Ivan arrived, he loves gazpacho.
CHON	
PINA	And that's not all! Since he wasn't calling, I've torn the phone from the wall, in a moment of rage...
CHON	I've tripped on the thing, but I didn't want to pry... And the bed? I think I noticed it smoking a bit...
PINA	I dropped a lit match and it began to burn, and I didn't want to squelch it. Fire purifies. I will have to change the mattress, but all for the best! A whole lot of less memories!
PINA	But excuse me, I've interrupted you. You were telling me... She grabs the tray, now full with coffee and pastries.
CHON	was telling you that I also have a suitcase at home.
PINA	Your husband's?
CHON	No. It's a suitcase with fifteen kilos of cocaine, uncut. Pina's eyes open wide.
PINA	You've become a dealer, Chon?
CHON	No! How could you think that! I am still a Counselor for Social Affairs in the City Hall! The suitcase appeared in my closet. Imagine the scandal if the Certainly!
CHON	I have to get rid of those fifteen kilos as soon as possible. (Thinks.) Because of the hours we keep, politicians consume a lot of drugs. So, between my party cohorts and city hall, I could distribute two kilos, but what do I do with the rest!
PINA	Throw it out!
CHON	Are you crazy? How could I throw it out?! I have to keep the police from finding it in my house... I have to take it some other place, immediately!
PINA	But I don't understand...
CHON	(Interrupts.) Well, it's clear, honey!
PINA	appeared in your closet?
CHON	pastry.) As I was telling you, after breaking up with my husband, I bumped into this guy on the street who kept watching at me, good-looking, well hung. Summing up, I took him home and screwed him over and over...
PINA	An how was he?
CHON	In bed? Divine. Look at my arm hair? I've got goose-bumps! (She shows her the hair on her arm, standing straight up.) He's that kind of guy who knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure!
PINA	So you lost your mind...
CHON	What else could I do?! So he asked me if he could stay at my place for a few days and I said OK, but I couldn't promise anything. I didn't want him thinking that I was that easy. So (breathes in) he brought the suitcase. He asked me if I cared if he kept it in the closet. He said that he was attached to the suitcase. And, well, why would I care?! (breathes in) By pure that the police have nabbed him in the course of a drug sting operation and that he is one of the most wanted traffickers! I open the suitcase and I discover that it is filled with little bags of cocaine. I ran out of the house and I haven't returned since... Pina breathes out in solidarity.
