CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
IN THE RING	Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
DEAKINS	You know what happened there?
HALE	Hell, I barely know what day it is.
DEAKINS	I set you up. I fake right, go left three times in a row. You expect it again, I take the right in hard. That's what boxing's all about. Make your opponent think you're gonna do one thing, then do another. Like Ali in Zaire, using the rope-a-dope on Foreman. Everyone thought Ali's arms were getting destroyed, when he was really just letting Foreman tire himself out. Eighth round, Ali starts hitting, George's got nothing left -- fight's over.
HALE	The fact that I can't feel the left side of my face -- that's okay, right? Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.
DEAKINS	Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
HALE	He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
DEAKINS	Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.
THE CROWD	Loves it.
HALE AND DEAKINS	Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.
DEAKINS	Don't watch my hands -- watch my shoulders. That's where the punch starts. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.
THE SPECTATORS	Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.
DEAKINS	You were looking at my hands. Let's try it again. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.
DEAKINS	Come on. Focus. Ready? My shoulders. Ready? Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
HALE	Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.
DEAKINS	He's in silhouette, the lights above him.
HALE	Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.
HALE AND DEAKINS	Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
HALE'S LOCKER	Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
DEAKINS' LOCKER	On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
HALE	Here.
HALE'S HAND	Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.
DEAKINS	I can't take that.
HALE	Oh, shut up.
DEAKINS	Really. I feel bad. How many times have we fought and how many times have you won?
HALE	Jerk.
DEAKINS	Well, if you insist. Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.
DEAKINS	You know why I beat you?
HALE	Because you've been boxing for twenty years and you're much better at it than I am?
DEAKINS	You don't want it enough. You had me today. I was back on my heels. But you didn't close the door.
HALE	We were just sparring.
DEAKINS	Life isn't sparring, Hale.
HALE	I think I saw that on a T-shirt. Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.
DEAKINS	Here.
HALE	No, that's yours.
DEAKINS	If you weren't giving it everything you've got, then I don't want it.
HALE	No, I mean -- that's yours, literally. I took it out of your wallet when you were in the shower. Deakins laughs, puts the money away.
DEAKINS/HALE	General.
BOONE	Gentlemen. Deak?
DEAKINS	Sorry. What's the mission, General?
BOONE	Simulate a border penetration. Hug the ground. Scare some cows. See if anyone can spot you.
HALE	The usual ...?
BOONE	No, actually, it's a little unusual. You're carrying a couple of nukes tonight, fellas. Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma and x-ray diffusion might screw up the peripherals. They asked us to send a couple on a run, see if anything glows.
HALE	'61s?
BOONE	Big ones. '83s.
HALE	Ooh. Crowpleasers.
HALE AND DEAKINS	Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
INTERCUT WITH BOMBS	Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into
DEAKINS	Ready for rollout.
THE GHOST	An enormous black flying wing.
HALE	You know, these exercises are fantastic. I mean, when that day comes and we finally go to war against Utah, we are really going to kick ass.
A PARK RANGER TRUCK	Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...
A RANGER	We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
RANGER	Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to somebody about this fire. We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.
JIM (O.S.)	Wha--? Oh, hell.
WANDA (O.S.)	I'll talk to him, Jim. Wanda, you stay put. Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.
JIM	I know -- no wood fires in the Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a cold and I wanted her to stay warm.
RANGER	Sir, you see any other hikers, campers anywhere around here?
JIM	Not this time of year. What's the fine for something like this?
RANGER	Your life. Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
BAKER	Done.
HEADLIGHTS	Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
MR. PRITCHETT	A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
PRITCHETT	Jesus. Do you think maybe you could get him out of the fire? Unless you like that smell.
DEAKINS	Weren't you going to call Taylor today about the Aurora Project?
HALE	Yeah. Turns out he wants people with more fighter hours.
DEAKINS	What'd you say?
HALE	What could I say?
DEAKINS	Jesus. You are such a pussy. You never fight for anything. Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.
HALE	Yeah, well you know what your problem is?
DEAKINS	Because I said what your problem is, you're gonna--?
HALE	You fight too much. Right? You said it yourself -- you should be at least Wing Commander by now. Maybe you would be if you didn't insist on telling people what they're doing wrong all the time.
DEAKINS	I'm usually right though, aren't I? Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.
DEAKINS	Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey, Wilkins, you old bag of dirt, your boys in Utah still awake?
WILKINS	Ready and waiting, Mr. Deakins. And tell our favorite hotshot, he's not gonna lose us tonight.
DEAKINS	Wilkins says you won't lose them tonight.
HALE	Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly this puppy up his ass without him knowing.
DEAKINS	Hale says ... if anyone can catch him it'd be you.
CU RADAR SCREEN	The Ghost makes a prominent blip on the screen.
WILKINS	Everyone get a fix! They're about to turn out the lights!
DEAKINS	Ready, Major?
HALE	On your word.
DEAKINS	Go to war.
THE COCKPIT	everything goes quiet.
CU RADAR SCREEN	The Ghost's blip disappears.
WILKINS	Lost 'em on active! Who's still got 'em?
IR CREWMAN	Got their heat signature, sir. Their engines may be cold, but the air is colder.
CU COMPUTER SCREEN	Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The
DEAKINS	Descend to 400 feet AGL. River valley approach.
HALE	Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach. Blue line descent on throttle to 400 feet AGL. Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends.
HALE	Time to limbo down. How low can we go. Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's...
TERRY CARMICHAEL	Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.
CLYDE (V.0.)	Terry? You been through the Needles entrance tonight?
TERRY	No. Why?
CLYDE (V.0.)	Mrs. Parker called --
TERRY	Oh, God. What is it this time? UFO abduction? Ritual human sacrifice?
CLYDE (V.0.)	She said she saw a bunch of trucks going through the Needles entrance an hour ago and thought they looked suspicious.
TERRY	Yes, well, this is a woman who chopped off one of her own fingers because it'd "turned on her."
CLYDE (V.0.)	Thing is, she said one of the trucks was ours, and you're the only one out.
TERRY	She was probably hallucinating, but I'll check it out.
IR CREWMAN	Lost 'em.
WILKINS	Stay on it. They're gonna have to come up for air sooner or later.
DEAKINS	We're under the radar. Proceed to primary target. Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on
HALE	I tell people I became a pilot because I wanted to fly cool planes. It's also for this. When we're up here, I feel... closer ... I don't know.
DEAKINS	To God? Is that what you're going to say? That you feel closer to God up here? Hell, Hale, with the payload we're carrying, we are God. Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between
DEAKINS	Hale, take a look out your side. I think our terrain following is off. It's got us two klicks from the left flank ridge. Hale turns to look out the window on his side.
HALE'S POV	Looking out the window. There's some movement in the reflection
HALE	Turns his head back toward Deakins.
HALE	Deak, you can't smoke in here -- But then Hale sees it's not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling
A GUN	And Deakins levels it right at Hale's head and his finger starts
HALE	Grabs Deakins' hand, pushing up as...
DEAKINS	Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.
HALE	The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching
DEAKINS AND HALE	Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes
THE BULLET	Tears through Hale's harness, blowing apart a shoulder strap.
HALE AND DEAKINS	Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet.
THE PLANE	Is banking towards a ridge-line cliff wall.
HALE	Sees it, yanks on the stick.
THE PLANE	Banks hard away from the cliff, just missing. Buttons include ONE, TWO, LOCK, LEFT, RIGHT, OPEN, CLOSE, ARM
HALE	No! He pulls at Deakins' arms.
CU COMPUTER SCREENS	Graphics of bomb racks rotate, the B-83 nukes -- labeled and
HALE AND DEAKINS	Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back.
CU COMPUTER SCREENS	The nukes rotate out of the release position. RELEASE and
HALE AND DEAKINS	Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in
TERRY	Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that there's nothing weird going on. No truck, no UFOs, and, except for the odd human head on a stick, no sign of Satan. She feels it before she hears it or sees it.
THE GHOST	Rushes over Terry, no more than fifty feet above the ground. The
TERRY	Holy shit.
DEAKINS' HAND	AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale's EJECTION HANDLE.
HALE AND DEAKINS	Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...
DEAKINS	Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the
HALE	His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.
HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE	Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened.
HALE'S POV	As he rockets up out of the cockpit.
HALE	When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the
TERRY	Somebody ejected!
WILKINS	They're not due for another halfhour.
DEAKINS	This is Deakins! Hale lost it! I have to punch out! Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He
CU RADAR SCREEN	The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus
WILKINS	That's not good.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES	40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look.
THE HELICOPTER	And it lifts up and flies off.
IN THE SAND	Something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on.
RHODES	Hold it. Come back. The lights sweep back, find... Sticking out of the sand.
BAIRD	Enters. Baird, 60s, is the White House Chief of Staff. His
BAIRD	So, do I wake the President?
CHAIRMAN	Where is he -- Las Vegas? Computer convention. Some information superhighway crap.
CHAIRMAN	Let him sleep for now. We're going out with this. Rick's team prepared it. The chairman nods toward RICK. Baird reads, mumbling.
BAIRD	"United States Air Force ... heavy-lift cargo plane ... down over the Utah desert ... status of crew not determined at this time ... yadda yadda ... Nice bullshit, Rick. Baird hands it to Rick, who starts for the door.
GILES (O.S.)	That's a mistake. The room quiets. All eyes on...
GILES	Baird's intensely competent assistant.
BAIRD	Giles ...?
GILES	Aviation Week has been following this plane's development for years. They have stringers who spend their vacations sitting in lawnchairs all night long by the Whiteman perimeter fence just in case one of these things takes off. The boys in those lawnchairs know one took off tonight. They're going to know when it doesn't come back. And when we put out a press release saying a C-130 went down in Utah, they're going to put two and two together. Aviation week will run a story, everyone'll know what really happened and we're going to look real stupid. We might as well tell the truth.
BAIRD	The truth? How the hell did you get this job? A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman --
BAIRD	Rewrite it. What Giles just said. Rick grits his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles.
BAIRD	I want you in Utah. Now. Giles nods, heads out. Baird grabs his arm.
BAIRD	You scare me sometimes.
GILES	Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare myself. And out Giles goes.
RHODES	Cockpit's empty! We're checking the payload!
WILKINS	Watch your needles!
INSIDE BOMB BAYS	Rhodes' light plays over the bomb racks -- empty.
RHODES	Colonel? We've got ourselves a Broken Arrow.
BAIRD	Broken Arrow?
CHAIRMAN	That's what we call it when we lose a nuclear weapon.
BAIRD	Oh, Jesus. I don't know what's scarier -- losing nuclear weapons or the fact that it happens so often that you people have a term for it.
WILKINS	Find the nukes, Sam. But be careful. I know they say those eggs can't be cracked, but if your geigers pick up more rads than you'd get off a toaster, I want you out of there. Wilkins to the CORPORAL.
WILKINS	Get the teams in. I want Colonel Rhodes and his men backed up.
CU COMPUTER SCREEN	Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing
BAIRD	They dropped from a plane but they didn't go off...?
CREELEY	They have to be armed to detonate.
BAIRD	Then they're destroyed?
CREELEY	They're designed to survive crashes intact. They can lie in a pool of burning jet fuel for five hours without any problem.
BAIRD	How did this happen?
CREELEY	In his last transmission, Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost control. He probably hit weapons release by accident. Believe me, when a plane's auguring in, you start pushing every button you can. Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head.
BAIRD	Hell, we should take the cost of the plane out of major Hale's salary. Although I guess at two billion dollars a pop, that could take a while.
HALE	Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to
TERRY	She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.
HALE AND TERRY	Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun.
HIS POV	Jarring, racing over rock and then...
HALE	Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.
HALE'S POV	He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop.
TERRY (O.S.)	That would be the wrong way.
TERRY	Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.
TERRY	Turn around. Look, I --
TERRY	Gimme your hands. Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.
HALE	I'm going to tell you something I can't tell you. Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching
HALE	There were nuclear weapons on that plane. The guy I was flying with is trying to steal them. Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.
HALE	I have to stop him, and I need your help. Look, pal, all I know is, I saw you come down, I come in to help you and you grab me, kick me and run away.
HALE	I only ran because you punched me.
TERRY	What, we're ten years old now? "You started it. No you started it."
HALE	He has men on the ground. I --
TERRY	Save it. My dog's waiting for his breakfast. Terry starts to push Hale along again and...
HALE	Jumps up and through the handcuffs.
TERRY	Reaches for her revolver, but...
HALE	Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...
TERRY	Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.
HALE AND TERRY	Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.
HALE	This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've got a gun.
TERRY	Yeah, well, I never keep my gun loaded. Terry taps her belt.
CLOSE ON HER BELT	A line of bullets.
HALE AND TERRY	Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on
HALE	Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out
HALE	I'm telling you the truth.
TERRY	This is a good way to convince me.
HALE	I could kill you now. Right? Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared.
HALE	I need your help. Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the
ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN	Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots
RHODES	Got 'em!
TERRY	I've got a radio in the truck. We can call McMurran and get the Marines in here.
HALE	Deakins'll be monitoring any radio transmissions out of here. That's what I'd do.
TERRY	Who is this guy?
HALE	Someone I would've trusted with my life. You've gotta get to a phone.
TERRY	Me? What are you going to do? Wait. You're gonna go after this guy? Isn't he going to have a lot guns and shit? I don't want to sound insulting or anything, but ... you're just a pilot.
HALE	I don't have any choice. The nukes are my responsibility. Besides... I do have one thing going for me.
TERRY	What's that? Hale sticks...
A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL	Under a rock.
HALE	The last thing in the world he expects is for me to come after him. Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the
RHODES	We've got one intact. Let's go find the other one. Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice.
A HUMVEE	climbs up the slope toward the helicopter.
MCKELLAR	Grabs his rifle, hops out of the helicopter.
NOVACEK AND LETT	Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks his head out.
NOVACEK	Hey, you guys need any help?
MCKELLAR	It's an Air Force training exercise, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
NOVACEK	Hey, no problem. We just --
LETT	Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots.
MCKELLAR	Barely has time to raise his rifle before he's hit. He drops.
ANOTHER HUMVEE	Drives up fast. Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.
NOVACEK	Picks up McKellar's half-eaten candy bar, takes a bite.
BAKER	Any sign of Deakins? Novacek, mouth full, shakes his head.
PRITCHETT	He better be dead.
DEAKINS (O.S.)	Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Pritchett. They all look over to see...
DEAKINS	Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly
PRITCHETT	You said nothing would go wrong!
DEAKINS	Well, point of fact, nothing has.
PRITCHETT	You didn't drop the nukes where you were supposed to!
DEAKINS	Ah, but we always planned on the search and rescue team finding the weapons for us, and they have. Mr. Pritchett, I really have thought of everything. Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.
JOHNSON	Newsflash. Two gunships just left from McMurran and they're headed this way.
PRITCHETT	You thought of that?
DEAKINS	That'll take care of itself.
PRITCHETT	What about the other pilot? We saw him eject.
DEAKINS	You don't have to worry about Major Hale. He's probably hiding behind a rock somewhere, praying I don't find him.
JOHNSON	Someone else might find him. A Ranger called her base, said she saw a pilot come down and was gonna go look for him. Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.
DEAKINS	Get ready. You'll go when the clean-up's done. Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter. Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry's
TERRY	Is that the new uniform?
HALE	Yeah. Less constricting.
TERRY	The dayshift guy left some work clothes in the truck. You can have them if you want. Hale nods. His feet crunch on something.
TERRY	Don't walk there.
HALE	Don't walk where?
TERRY	On that black stuff. That's cryptogamic soil. It's very fragile. One footprint takes centuries to repair.
HALE	That's a new one. Endangered dirt. Terry gives Hale a look.
RHODES	Hello? McMurran? Come in. Suddenly, there's a soft popping sound and Reed drops.
RHODES	Reed? What the --? Rhodes looks down, sees blood on Reed. Before he can say
WILKINS	Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam?
THE RED LASER BEAN	Dances along the wall, heading for them.
RHODES	Raises his pistol and shoots at the source of the laser.
PRITCHETT AND DEAKINS	Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins
RHODES	We'll open up the access panels, put in a couple grenades. The nukes won't go nuclear, but they will go dirty. I won't lie and say we'll be all right. We won't. But if we're gonna go, might as well take those bastards with us. Rhodes scrambles off.
KELLY	Just one thing, sir. What?
KELLY	This. Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes is thrown back, dead.
KELLY	Done! Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast.
THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL	From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket.
KELLY	Climbs into view. Colonel Wilkins? You there?
WILKINS	Who is this?
KELLY (V.0.)	It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir.
WILKINS	What happened, Kelly?
KELLY	Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir! They're all dead! What happened? Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40
KELLY	It's the nuke, sir! It's open! Wide open! Oh, God, what am I going to do?! Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He
WILKINS	Call back the teams and get me the Room. We're gonna need NEST in here.
DEAKINS	Brought a tear to my eye.
KELLY	I'd just like to thank the members of the Academy.
PRITCHETT	I hope you've got another surprise up your sleeve. If I'm not mistaken, there are two attack helicopters headed this way.
JOHNSON	Not any longer. They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.
JOHNSON	They've just been recalled.
DEAKINS	You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think they've got an exposed core. They'll want to get a satellite to take a look, but it'll take ninety minutes minimum to shift the orbit. Until then? Well, people get a little weird when it comes to radiation. No one'll have the balls to come near here unless it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency Search Teams --and it'll take the nearest team at least two hours to get out here, and we only need an hour to reach our connection with the transport squad. Not that I'm not delighted with your presence, but you really don't need to be here.
HALE	What's your dog's name?
TERRY	Bear. I was going to call him Death, so I could say things like, "I walk with Death," and "Death chewed my boots," but I chickened out. You?
HALE	No dog.
TERRY	Do you have a name, or is that classified? Before Hale can answer...
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER	Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
TERRY AND HALE	Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...
THE TRUCK	is riddled with bullets and explodes.
TERRY AND HALE	Sprint up the trail.
HALE	We've gotta hide!
TERRY	Follow me! Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top
HALE	Hide where?
IN THE HELICOPTER	Novacek grins, shoots.
HALE	Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he
HALE	What the --?
TERRY (O.S)	Come on! Hale runs in the direction of her voice.
NOVACEK'S POV	Aiming at Hale's back. But then Hale suddenly drops from view.
HALE	Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep sand.
TERRY	This way. Terry runs. Hale follows.
HALE	How do you --?
TERRY	I'm a Ranger. I've been over these trails a million times. Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
IN THE HELICOPTER	Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.
TERRY AND HALE	Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.
TERRY	Please don't tell anyone I did that.
IN THE HELICOPTER	Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
TERRY AND HALE	Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
THE HELICOPTER	Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
HALE	Can you climb up?
TERRY	Yeah ...?
HALE	Give me your gun.
TOP OF CLIFF	Terry climbs up into view of...
NOVACEK	Who sees her.
TERRY	Pull herself up, stands, hands up.
THE HELICOPTER	Novacek swivels the helicopter around.
TERRY	This has nothing to do with me.
NOVACEK	Tell me where he is!
HALE	Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the
HALE	Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat back a foot ... Puts him right about ... here. Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then
IN THE HELICOPTER	The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
THE HELICOPTER	Starts to lean over sideways.
HALE	Is surprised -- it worked!'
TERRY	Watches in horror as...
TERRY	Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...
THE ROTOR BLADES	Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The Up and over, in a high arc.
TERRY	Looks up. Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her.
HALE AND TERRY	Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...
THE TAIL SECTION	Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a
HALE AND TERRY	Run clear.
PRITCHETT	We don't have to worry about the other pilot? Deakins shakes his head.
PRITCHETT	Then how come the helicopter crashed?
DEAKINS	Pilot error. Deakins turns and walks away, over to...
BAKER AND KELLY	Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each
PRITCHETT	Tell me again how I don't need to be here.
DEAKINS	Mr. Pritchett, I understand your concerns. You and your associates gave me a lot of money to mount this operation. But they're getting ten times that back if we succeed.
PRITCHETT	If we succeed?
DEAKINS	All I can do is my part. We've got the weapons, we're ... ... seventeen minutes ahead of schedule and everything will be in place within two hours. But I can't guarantee that the assholes in Washington won't do something stupid like not pay.
PRITCHETT	What if they don't?
DEAKINS	Then the next census for this region is going to show a very sudden drop in population.
GILES	Colonel Wilkins? I'm Giles Prentice. My word from your search and rescue team?
WILKINS	No.
GILES	I'm sorry. Picked up any radiation? Wilkins shakes his head.
GILES	That's kind of strange -- if there's an exposed core out there.
WILKINS	Point?
GILES	Probably nothing. I asked for a transcript of the last cockpit transmission...? Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles
WILKINS	I don't know what you expect to find.
CU TRANSCRIPTS	We see COLONEL DEAKINS: "This is Deakins! Hale lost it! Oh,
GILES	You know these guys? The pilots?
WILKINS	Just on the radio. Never met 'em. Why?
GILES	What if this wasn't pilot error?
BAIRD	No rhetorical questions, Giles. Spit it out.
GILES	In the last transmission from the plane, Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost it and made the plane crash. We all assumed that meant pilot error. But what if Deakins meant Hale made the plane crash. Murmurs of "That's insane" "No way" fill the room.
BAIRD	Why would he do that?
GILES	Two nuclear weapons would be worth a hell of a lot of money.
CHAIRMAN	To whom? Son, there are easier ways for someone to buy nuclear weapons. You go to one of the old Soviet republics, you can get one for the price of a BMW.
GILES	I meant they'd be worth a lot of money to us. How much would we pay to get them back? To make sure they weren't used in this country? A flurry of looks around the room.
BAIRD	Hold on, hold on. These nukes have codes or something that prevent people from using them.
CREELEY	Of course.
BAIRD	No one has these codes -- outside of the President and you guys.
CREELEY	Access to the codes requires the highest security --
BAIRD	I mean, not even the pilots have these codes, right? Creeley starts to stammer. Baird slumps. The chairman turns.
CHAIRMAN	Where's that NEST team now?
ASSISTANT	They just took off.
HUNT	Listen up, sportsfans. Word is, this particular broken arrow has broken open. Our ETA Utah is ninety-six minutes. I want everyone to take that time to triple-check the seams and seals on their E-suits. Let's go!
GILES	You think I'm nuts. You don't think NEST or the satellite will find anything weird.
WILKINS	That's right. But it wouldn't hurt to get some gunships fueled just in case. Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles.
HALE	How do they get out of here?
TERRY	Get out? I don't think that helicopter's going anywhere.
HALE	Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be prepared.
TERRY	If they've got trucks they could take the four-wheel-drive trail we were on.
HALE	He wouldn't want to go towards town.
TERRY	He could go to the river. Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do.
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE	Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back.
DEAKINS	You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?
PRITCHETT	I think it's barbaric.
DEAKINS	Me, too! I love it! Two men trying to do as much damage to the other as he can. As basic as you can get, don't you think?
PRITCHETT	I think it should be banned.
DEAKINS	So do I! God, wouldn't that make it more exciting? Having to go into dark alleys and basements to see a fight? I bet we see eye-to- eye on a lot of things, Mr. Pritchett. Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams.
THEIR POV	The two Humvees make their way along the trail.
HALE	See the one in front? It just has a driver? They wanted to keep the weight down. It has the nukes. Hale takes Terry's gun from her.
TERRY	You gonna shoot out the tires?
HALE	Humvees can reseal and inflate with the flick of a switch. That's why Deak chose 'em. Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?
HALE	I'm gonna steal it. You get to a phone and call McMurran.
TERRY	The nearest phone is a two-hour walk.
HALE	Then you better start walking.
TERRY	Look, I know my way around here. You're gonna need me.
HALE	I appreciate what you've done so far. But now it gets hairy. Go to the phone. He scrambles off over the rock.
THE HUMVEES	Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot-
HALE AND TERRY	Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at
IN THE HUMVEE	Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol,
HALE AND TERRY	Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his
HALE	Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE	Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet.
DEAKINS	Run him down.
HALE	Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.
TERRY	Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.
TERRY	Here! She slides the pistol along the truck roof.
HALE	Grabs the gun out of the air as...
BAKER	Slams on the brakes.
TERRY	Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.
HALE	Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up,
DEAKINS AND KELLY	Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins
IN THE LEAD HUMVEE	Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts
HALE	Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.
HALE	Gimme the gun and get out. I don't know. I think we got ourselves a little stand-off.
HALE	No, we don't. Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.
TERRY	Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...
HALE	Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.
BAKER	Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of...
DEAKINS' HUMVEE	And is run over.
HALE	Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.
HALE	You drive!
TERRY	Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams
HALE	I'd yell at you for coming after me, but you did just save my life. There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He
DEAKINS	What're you doing, Hale?
IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE	Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape
A FLARE	Out of the tool kit.
KELLY	Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd show us.
BETWEEN THE HUMVEES	Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee.
THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE	Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the
ECU TIP OF FLARE	As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and...
DEAKINS	Stop! But it's too late and...
THE JERRY CAN	Explodes.
THE SECOND HUMVEE	Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and
DEAKINS	Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying. Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him,
HALE	We need somewhere to hide. I know a place.
TERRY	It was a copper mine, barely squeaking along for years. They shut it-down a few months ago when they hit an underground river. The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
HALE	They hardwired in their frequency. We can't call out.
TERRY	What are we gonna do? Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.
HALE	I'm gonna take away Deakins' reason for being here. Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
INSIDE PANEL	There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the
TERRY	Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?
HALE	They're designed to be used by guys wearing gloves in Alaska. He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.
HALE	These nukes have security codes. If you enter the wrong code three times, the nuke goes dead -- all the circuitry shorts out and shuts down. Kind of like the security systems with car radios.
TERRY	And people say the public doesn't benefit from defense spending. Hand me the radio. Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something.
A PLASTIC NAME TAG	Sticking out from under one of the nukes.
HALE	Pulls it out, looks at it.
ECU NAMETAG	It's from "St. Judes Hospital, Radiology Department."
HALE AND TERRY	Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.
HALE	Where's St. Judes Hospital?
HALE (V.0.)	Deak -- you there? Deakins and Kelly look at each other.
HALE (V.O.)	Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're starting a new round. You took the first couple, but I've got you on the ropes now, you son of bitch. Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.
DEAKINS	Hey, there. What was that last part? There was some static. Find them. Let's go! Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one
CROSSCUT BETWEEN HALE AND DEAKINS	Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.
HALE	I know you're stalling while you try to find the nukes with your scanner, but you're gonna be too late. Hear that? Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.
HALE	I'm entering the wrong code, you bastard. A couple more times and these are gonna be useless to you.
DEAKINS	You really got me there. I sure didn't think of that. Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.
DEAKINS	All that time we spent in the cockpit together and you think I'm stupid? I got some new boards and circuits from a friend at Pantex. But nice try. Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head
DEAKINS	You know, Hale, I thought of asking you to join me on this. You wanna know why I didn't?
HALE	Because I would've said no?
DEAKINS	I would've just killed you if you said no. I was more afraid you'd say yes. Because I knew I couldn't count on you. You can pretend you've got guts, but when and if it comes down to it, you're gonna run off crying like a little girl.
HALE	You better hope that's true, Doak. Because I've got the nukes, and there's nothing to stop me from entering the right code, if you know what I mean.
DEAKINS	You wouldn't do that.
HALE	Nah. You're right. I wouldn't have the guts. END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.
HALE	How deep is this mine?
TERRY	I don't know. A couple thousand feet.
HALE	That's deep enough. Hale opens the elevator gate.
TERRY	For what?
HALE	A nuclear explosion. Terry's jaw drops.
JOHNSON	Got it! They're --
DEAKINS	In the mine. I could tell he was inside something. There was an echo.
TERRY	We can still hide them!
HALE	He's got a scanner. He'd find them.
TERRY	You're talking about setting off a nuclear weapon!
HALE	They set them off underground in Nevada all through the fifties and sixties. There's no risk.
TERRY	Tell it to the two-headed cows. Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can
TERRY	No! I am not helping you set off a nuclear weapon.
HALE	We won't be down there when it goes off. This isn't a suicide mission.
TERRY	No! All right. Fine. Though I think you should know, before I ejected, I heard Deakins say the nukes were going to be used to wipe out the last few remaining handicapped gay whales. Terry looks at him -- you asshole. Hale looks at her, very
HALE	I need your help. Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke.
HALE	When we get to the bottom we'll have to get away from this shaft. It'll limit the amount of radiation released into-the atmosphere.
TERRY	We'll each drag one down a tunnel?
HALE	No. I'm only going to set off one. We'll leave the other one here. It'll be buried under a billion tons of rock. They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them
HALE	We better hurry. Let's try down there. They start hauling the nuke down the tunnel.
PRITCHETT	I can't wait to see how this fits into your plan. Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett
ON THE MONITORS	A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain.
CREELEY	This is the KH-12 satellite's infrared view of the area. An exposed nuclear core would be relatively hot -- it'd show as a circle of bright white. As you can see, there's nothing. The only heat signatures we found were these. The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red.
BAIRD	What's --?
CREELEY	We think it's Colonel Rhodes and his men. Their bodies. A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for
WILKINS	I understand, sir. Was I right? Wilkins nods. Giles grins smugly for about half a second, then
GILES	Oh, shit.
WILKINS	I've got ten ships ready to go ... We should be hearing from NEST any minute now.
TERRY	How do you know how to do this?
HALE	Pilots who fly with nuclear weapons have standing orders to ... ... "retrieve if possible, disable if necessary and destroy if we must," and destroy I must. He stands, looks around. He sees...
EYEBOLTS	Screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling.
HALE	I'm gonna need your belt and one of your socks.
KELLY	Send it up?
DEAKINS	Let's take care of Hale first. Spread out.
TERRY	Take your time. Really. Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He
HALE	Okay. Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the
CLOSE ON NUCLEAR WEAPON	One chip has been pulled out of a circuit board. Hale very
HALE	We make a small hole in the sock, and we're hopefully in New Mexico -- the sock is pulled through the eyebolt, the rock drops... ... hitting the rock on this chip, closing the firing circuit and that's it. Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.
TERRY	How much time are we going to have?
HALE	I don't know precisely. This isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes, maybe -- Hale is cut off by...
BULLETS	Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls, fired by...
JOHNSON	Thirty yards down the tunnel.
HALE AND TERRY	Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.
THE SOCK	One of Johnson's bullets cuts through it.
HALE	Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.
HIS POV	Sand is draining out of the sock very fast.
HALE AND TERRY	Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of
TERRY	Come on!
HALE	The sock -- More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage.
JOHNSON	Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for
THE SOCK	The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt.
THE ROCK	Drops fast toward the nuke.
A HAND	Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to...
DEAKINS	He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He
DEAKINS	We're at the end of tunnel three. You two get this one set. I'll take the other one up.
HALE AND TERRY	Running along a tunnel.
TERRY	What do we do?
HALE	Beat 'em back to the elevator. Stop 'em from getting out. Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...
A FLURRY OF BULLETS	Fired by...
DEAKINS	With his Uzi.
HALE AND TERRY	Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all
DEAKINS	Slows down.
DEAKINS	The bit with the sock was good. I like it. Still, I'm gonna use the the Field Expedient Tactical Timer. It's a little more precise. See, Hale -- you aren't the only one who's thought of setting off a nuke in this mine.
BY THE NUKE	Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a
INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE	An elaborate electronic timer.
IN THE TUNNELS	Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.
DEAKINS	I need a demonstration. Otherwise, some swinging dick in Washington is going to say I don't have the balls or the ability to set off a nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show these puppies I'm ready, willing and able. Hell, I'm eager. Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.
HALE AND TERRY	In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...
DEAKINS	Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along
HALE AND TERRY	Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.
DEAKINS	The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale
HALE AND TERRY	Take cover. It's a stand-off.
DEAKINS	Well, Hale, I better be going. Look at it this way, partner. If you wanted to get closer to God, you are about to get your wish. Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.
HALE	You're gonna ransom Salt Lake City, aren't you? The footsteps stop.
DEAKINS	What makes you think that?
HALE	That's where St. Judes Hospital is. You're gonna hide the nukes near the radiology department so they won't show up an any satellite radiation scans.
DEAKINS	I'm impressed.
HALE	How much are you gonna ask for?
DEAKINS	Enough. I've got a broker in Stockholm. Monday morning he's going to buy me five percent of Volvo. For the rest of my days I'm going to live off the dividends, happy in the knowledge I'm helping to build the safest car in the world.
HALE	So that's it? You're just doing 'this for the money? I'm kind of disappointed.
DEAKINS	Why would you do it, Hale?
HALE	That's the thing -- I wouldn't.
DEAKINS	If you were me.
HALE	If I were you...? Because ... because I got passed over for promotion and goddamnit I'm going to show the bastards that I'm smarter than them all. Because ... everyone's selling out and cashing in, so why not me? Because ... because my ex-wife was sleeping around. Because my parents abused me. Because I ate some sugar. Because I don't like Mondays. It's all bullshit, Deak. There are no reasons. Not really. There's no difference between you and the guy who shoots up the schoolyard with an M-16. You both think you have reasons. You both think you were wronged. The truth? You're both just fucked in the head.
DEAKINS' FACE	Grim, evil -- fades into darkness as he turns and walks off.
HALE AND TERRY	They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding
THE TIMER	Starts ticking down from ton minutes.
KELLY AND JOHNSON	Grab their guns and run.
DEAKINS	Mr. Pritchett!
KELLY AND JOHNSON	Run in. A half-second of surprise is broken when...
THE ELEVATOR	Comes down.
HALE AND TERRY	Make a move toward the elevator, but...
KELLY AND JOHNSON	Unload with their Uzis.
HALE AND TERRY	Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.
JOHNSON	Is shot, drops.
KELLY	Grabs Johnson's Uzi and, firing both guns, backs to the
HALE AND TERRY	Step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator. Seven minutes and counting.
TERRY	We can go back, try to shut it down.
HALE	We don't know the code, and Deak'd have it wired to blow if we so much as look at it funny.
TERRY	Then we're... Hale looks at her.
HALE	I'm sorry. I shouldn't've let you come.
TERRY	Oh, God. Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her.
TERRY	I ... I just hope someone remembers to feed my dog. Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but
HALE	Come on. Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel.
TERRY	What're you --?
HALE	You said they shut down the mine when they hit an underground river.
THE NEST HELICOPTER	Coming toward him, two miles away.
HUNT	Ten o'clock! In the clearing!
HIS POV	The blackened Humvee and Deakins by the mine entrance.
THEIR POV	Dark water rushes by ten feet below them.
HALE	Any idea where it goes?
TERRY	No. They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They
DEAKINS	Get in. We're leaving.
PRITCHETT	Aren't you going to wait for them?
DEAKINS	No time. And if they get out, they might talk. Fortunately, there's something wrong with the elevator. Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly
KELLY	Wrong person to screw with, Deak. He pulls open the gate and climbs down.
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT	Kelly swings under the elevator.
KELLY	I know the goddamn code, asshole. He grabs the cable trailing off below the elevator and starts
INSERT - ECU NUKE TIMER	Two minutes and counting.
STALACTITES	Jutting down like knives, ready-to rip then open.
HALE AND TERRY	Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...
THE CEILING	Is getting lower, getting closer to the surface of the water.
UNDERWATER	Tumbling along, pulled at by the eddies, flashlights showing
HALE AND TERRY	Lungs bursting, they start kicking up.
THE NEST HELICOPTER	Closing in on him.
PRITCHETT	Is holding on tight as Deakins drives wildly.
PRITCHETT	I think I've finally figured out your plan. Those guys in the helicopter are going to kill us, but we're going to rise from the dead and
DEAKINS	Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his
PRITCHETT	Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any air. He pulls at his
DEAKINS	Maybe now you'll shut up.
INSERT - ECU NUKE TIMER	Thirty seconds and counting.
IN THE HUMVEE	Deakins has a thought and looks over at Pritchett, dead, held up
DEAKINS	I just realized I've never killed anyone before. I mean, I dropped bombs on Baghdad, but never face to face. I don't know what the big deal is.
ECU NUKE TIMER	Eighteen seconds left.
KELLY	Runs up, starts entering numbers into the timer keypad.
HUNT	Let him know we're here!
THE TRIP ODOMETER	It clicks over from 2.9 to 3.0 miles.
DEAKINS	Grins, steps on the brakes.
THE NEST HELICOPTER	A hundred feet in the air, slowly coming in toward Deakins.
ECU NUKE TIMER	Eleven, ten, nine...
KELLY	Punches in the last two numbers of the code then ENTER.
ECU NUKE TIMER	It stops with seven seconds left. The amber light goes off and
KELLY	Sits back on the floor, takes a breath.
DEAKINS' HAND	He's holding a small black box. He presses a button and...
THE TIMER	The red light goes out. The amber light comes on. A splitsecond
KELLY	Oh shit. The screen goes white. Watching the helicopter, listening to Hunt over the loudspeaker. Do not move or you will be fired --
THE GROUND	Rises up beneath Deakins. The ripples of the shockwave shoot out from the mine, shaking
DEAKINS AMD THE HUMVEE	Fly ten feet into the air.
HUNT	No...! They plummet.
THE NEST HELICOPTER	Drops out of sight behind a rock formation. There's an
GILES	That's all we need. A goddamn earthquake.
WILKINS	Son, I was at the Nevada Test site in the fifties. That wasn't an earthquake.
DEAKINS	At least I know they work.
WILKINS	Get me the Room.
GILES	I have to get out of here. You're going to be fine. It was underground. Colonel Wilkins for General Creeley.
GILES	How do you know?
WILKINS	For one thing, if it was above ground, it wouldn't have caused the same kind of ground tremor. For another, if it was above ground, we'd all be blind and dying. Sir, we've just had a detonation.
BAIRD	How'd that happen?
CHAIRMAN	I don't know, but thank God it happened underground.
BAIRD	What do we do now?
CHAIRMAN	First thing we do is put a huge goddamn lid on this thing. With all due respect to your boy Giles and his belief in honesty as the best policy, from now on and until the end of time, what happened in Utah tonight was an earthquake. All right? Baird nods.
IN THE HUMVEE	Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor along. Deakins turns to
DEAKINS	The helicopter? It was hit by EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's released in a nuclear detonation. It wipes out anything electronic for miles. That"s another reason I wanted to set off a nuke. I knew it'd bring down any helicopters coming for us. It'll also shut down all radio communications for a few hours, which will severely screw up their response. You see, Mr. Pritchett? There really is nothing for you to worry about. Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee.
BUTTERFLIES	Hover and dance over the water in the early morning light.
HALE	Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out.
TERRY (O.S.)	Goddamn it! He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to
TERRY	Stupid buttons. I hate these shirts. They're ugly and stupid and -- Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset
HALE	It's okay.
TERRY	We just ... I mean, we almost...
HALE	I know.
TERRY	A nuclear bomb went off.
HALE	That it did.
TERRY	Are we...?
HALE	Look. If the butterflies are okay, then we'll be okay.
TERRY	Really?
HALE	Absolutely. It says so in the manual. "If you see butterflies after a detonation, you are fine." Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she
HALE	We better get moving. We might be able to reach Deakins when he gets to the river. They start off along a trail by the river.
HALE	Something I've been meaning to ask. How did someone like you end up with a gun?
TERRY	I hit a bankrobber with a frozen chicken.
HALE	Excuse me?
TERRY	I came out here one summer during college. It was the campaign to stop the dam in the Grand Canyon. I loved it here. I came back, worked as a river guide and eventually stayed year-round. When a Park Ranger job came open, I applied.
HALE	I'm still waiting for the chicken.
TERRY	The local Parks Department wasn't sure how I'd do with the law enforcement part of the job. Well, one night I was coming home from the store and Tommy Drewson part of the local brain trust was robbing old Bob Kearney in front of the ATM. I bear old Bob yelling and I see Tommy heading for his car, so I tossed a bag of groceries at him at thirty miles an hour. A frozen chicken in the bag hit him in the forehead and he dropped like a rock. Next thing I know, I'm a Ranger. Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.
THEIR POV	A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with
TERRY	Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and he's a dead man. There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands,
DEAKINS	Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard.
SHEPPARD	Where is everyone?
DEAKINS	I am everyone. Let's go. Sheppard hurries to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.
HALE	Shit.
TERRY	What?
HALE	We're the only ones who know what's going on, and I don't have the faintest idea how we're gonna stop them.
TERRY	You'll think of something.
HALE	Why do you say that?
TERRY	You have so far. Hale looks at Terry -- she's right. But it almost pisses him
TERRY	Sink it?
HALE	Steal it. They get down to the raft. They climb in. Hale grabs the
HALE	Keys. Hale looks around, spots Sheppard's duffel bag lying on the Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.
THEIR POV	Of the raft. Hale and Terry are nowhere to be seen.
HALE	Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the raft, very
SHEPPARD (O.S.)	Why were you driving around with a dead guy?
DEAKINS (O.S.)	Because I like him. He doesn't ask a lot of annoying questions. All right? A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard
A TARP	Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.
DEAKINS	Grabs the tarp and pulls.
UNDER THE TARP	There's no one there.
DEAKINS	Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...
A LONG CRATE MARKED "LIFE JACKETS"	Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite
MAX	Your friends in Washington should be getting the package about now.
DEAKINS	I wish I could see their faces.
ON THE TV	Camcorder shot of Deakins against a black backdrop.
DEAKINS	... two-hundred-and-fifty million dollars, by nine a.m. Utah time. The depositing instructions are in the envelope that came with this tape. This deadline is not negotiable, and there is no grace period. The device is on a timer. Shortly after you receive this, the timer will be activated. At nine a.m., I will make a call. If I find out you've done as you've been told, I will stop the timer. If you have not complied -- The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear
CHAIRMAN	Turn that off!
A MARINA	Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign
TERRY	Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
BAIRD	Yes, sir. Creeley's phone rings. He answers it.
CREELEY	Creeley.
BAIRD	The President wants to know if we know where the device is headed.
CHAIRMAN	If Deakins had a plane waiting, it could be anywhere. We just don't know.
CREELEY	I do. Major Hale is alive. According to him, Colonel Deakins is headed for Salt Lake City.
HALE, WILKINS AND GILES	Are walking toward the second helicopter.
WILKINS	We found the raft on the other side of the lake. Tracks from a heavy truck ran out when they hit the paved road.
HALE	If we get a rad scanner we can track them. A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.
WILKINS	Actually, Major, we're going back to McMurran.
HALE	What?
GILES	We'd just like to ask you a few questions.
HALE	I'm not wasting time answering questions. We've got --
WILKINS	No debate, Major. I was given orders. Now, you can come with us, or you can go with them. Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing
HALE	Deakins thinks I'm dead. He thinks it's over. You've got to let me go after him. I can help. I know how his mind works.
WILKINS	Major, I know this is personal for you, but I think we can handle it. We're putting a wall of men and machines around Salt Lake City as we speak. That truck is not getting through. Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls.
HALE	What about the Ranger?
GILES	What about her?
HALE	When you find that truck, you'll hit it hard. Chances are she'll be killed in the crossfire. "Regrettable but unavoidable." Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.
HALE	Look, she's not supposed to be there. She should be checking camping permits, finding lost kids. She... She saved my life. Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...
WILKINS	We were ordered to take you back to McMurran. You understand what orders are, don't you, Major? Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
WILKINS	Major, put that away or say goodbye to your career and hello to twenty years in Leavenworth.
HALE	If that's what it takes.
WILKINS	You'll have to shoot me. Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
GILES	Colonel! How about this? Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.
HALE	I swear to God I'll shoot. Wilkins grins.
MAX	Ready when you are.
DEAKINS	Wait until I get back. I'm going to check on Sheppard. Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.
WILKINS	I don't know what you're looking for, Major. Every road between here and salt Lake has already been sealed.
HALE	Deak would know that. Maybe he's not on the road. Wilkins doesn't understand.
HALE	They were using maps like these to set up the roadblocks?
WILKINS	Yes...?
HALE	Then that's the answer. Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...
TRAIN TRACKS	On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds.
HALE	It's an old spur. Probably hasn't been used in twenty years. Nobody bothered to put it on the new maps.
WILKINS	What are you --?
HALE	The nuke isn't in a truck, Colonel. It's on a train.
DEAKINS	Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck,
THE FOUR GUNMEN	Are in position at points along the train, ready with Uzis.
WILKINS	Radio's still down. We'll head north, look for a phone, then look for a train. Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.
HALE	No. Go south.
GILES	Salt Lake is north.
HALE	He's not going to Salt Lake.
GILES	But you said it would be Salt Lake. You found that hospital tag.
HALE	He planted that. He wanted whoever found it to think that's where he was going. He's been doing a rope-a-dope. Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts.
HALE	It's a boxing term. When Ali -- Look, I know this guy. If everything has been saying he's heading north, then he's heading south. They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.
WILKINS	What's south of here?
ECU MAP	Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes
HALE	No. Not Vegas. What the hell is there to blow up in Vegas? Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map.
GILES	The President. Wilkins' finger stops.
TERRY	Crouching down between the two cars.
DEAKINS	How much longer?
SHEPPARD	Almost done.
TERRY	Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's
SHEPPARD (O.S.)	How long until the helicopter gets here?
DEAKINS	Five minutes. We'll leave from the boxcar roof. Deakins turns to go.
TERRY	Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still.
DEAKINS	As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head.
WILKINS' HELICOPTER	Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps
DEAKINS	Terry, Max. Max, Terry.
MAX	A pleasure. What the hell is a "Terry" and why is it still live?
DEAKINS	She asked me how I thought I was going to get away with this and I thought I'd tell her. We're going to a cabin in the mountains, not far from here. When we get there I'm gonna make two phone calls. The first is to the Pentagon. I'm gonna tell them where the train is. See, all their forces are up at Salt Lake by now. By the time they could get a F-15 down here the train will be on the outskirts of Vegas. And I'll remind them about the impact trigger -- if they hit this train hard, the nuke'll blow. They won't have any choice. They'll have to let the train get into the city and because of that, they'll have to pay.
TERRY	You said two phone calls.
DEAKINS	The second will be to my bank in Geneva. If the money's in my account, I use this... ... and shut down the timer. If not, we sit back, put on some shades and get a quick tan.
TERRY	But -- radio isn't working.
DEAKINS	You saw the dish on the roof? Microwave. It's not affected by EMP. See? I really have thought of everything.
MAX	You kept her alive just so you can impress her with how smart you are?
DEAKINS	No, I kept her alive because I want her to do me a favor. See, if something goes wrong and this thing goes off, a half a million people are going to be vaporized. I don't want that on my conscience. So I'm not going to arm the nuke. She is.
AIR FORCE ASSISTANT	Starting at ground zero and moving out, we have, in terms of immediate effect, one hundred percent fatalities to thirty miles. Ninety percent from thirty to forty miles, dropping roughly ten percent for every-ten miles after that. The long term --
CHAIRMAN	Son?
AIR FORCE ASSISTANT	Two hundred and fifty thousand in the first few seconds. The same again within a year.
BAIRD	Good God.
DEAKINS	Nine ... Then pound ... Good. Now six ...
ECU TERRY'S EYES	Filled with tears. She blinks and...
QUICK CUTS	Terry has visions of RETIREES in Vegas, watering potted plants
DEAKINS	Seven ... Star ... One... And Terry shakingly pushing each button and then...
DEAKINS	Then ENTER and it's done.
TERRY	Her finger hovers over the ENTER button, almost pushes it, then
ECU NUKE TIMER	The display goes blank.
DEAKINS	Stunned. He shakes his head.
DEAKINS	Ooh. You really shouldn't have done that. I said I would kill you, and I will.
TERRY	I'm gonna be dead either way. I don't want any part of this. Deakins shrugs -- he sees her logic. He puts his gun to Terry's
DEAKINS	Night-night. Deakins is about to pull the trigger when Max stops him. Max
DEAKINS	They're early. Just then, they hear gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.
DEAKINS	It's not a problem. Set the timer, then kill her. Have fun with it. Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch.
TERRY'S HAND	Rests on Max's tool tray. Her fingers creep over to a vrench.
MAX	Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer.
MAX	There.
TERRY AND MAX	Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out
MAX	Thought I was just friendly old Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL. You should see what I can do with just my thumb. Max goes for his gun.
TERRY'S HAND	Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.
TERRY AND MAX	As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It
TERRY	Yeah? Well, you should see what I can do with just a chicken.
HALE	That's him!
WILKINS	Get him!
PILOT	They've got guns!
WILKINS	You've got a helicopter. Use it!
THE HELICOPTER	Comes swooping in.
DEAKINS	Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as...
THE HELICOPTER	Drops down beside the train. The rotor blades whip about three
DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN	Run from the blades as fast as they can.
THE HELICOPTER	Closes fast.
DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN	Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the
DEAKINS	Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right
HELICOPTER POV	Swooping fast over the train when suddenly...
TERRY	Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter.
HALE (O.S.)	Pull up!
THE HELICOPTER	Pulls up fast.
TERRY	Watches the helicopter bank away. Bullets-start whizzing by her.
DEAKINS	Has climbed up and is shooting at her.
TERRY	Runs away from Deakins, shooting Max's pistol behind her blindly.
TWO GUNMEN	Appear two cars ahead of Terry and start toward her, shooting.
TERRY	Is caught between Deakins and the gunmen with no way out when...
THE HELICOPTER	Comes along the length of the train, flying low. It rises up
HALE	Hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked to a harness and
THE FIRST GUNMAN	He's hit, falls off the train.
THE SECOND GUNMAN	Aims at Terry and starts firing.
TERRY	The bullets rip up the boxcar roof around her. She jumps up and
HALE	As he swings in on the cable, shooting his pistol.
HALE AND TERRY	Are lifted up and over...
THE SECOND GUNMAN	Who turns, firing a shotgun. Hale's bullets find him. He falls.
SHEPPARD	Appears, firing an Uzi at Hale, Terry and the helicopter.
IN THE HELICOPTER	Bullets rip through. Wilkins is hit, knocked back.
THE CABLE HOLDING HALE AND TERRY	
HALE AND TERRY	Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.
SHEPPARD	Is hit and drops.
THE HELICOPTER	Banks away fast, making ugly sounds, smoke billowing out. The
HALE AND TERRY	Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at
TERRY	You stop the nuke. I'll stop the train. Hale nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.
TERRY	I'd yell at you for coming after me, but you did just save my life. Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the distance. They look
A RED CROSS HELICOPTER	Coming in fast.
HALE AND TERRY	Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...
A MAN	Standing in the doorway of the Red Cross helicopter, holding a
TERRY	That's Deakins' escape route.
HALE	Not any more. Terry nods. They share a last look, then Terry heads off. Male
THE SHOTGUN	Left by deceased Gunman #2.
A PICKUP TRUCK	Tearing toward then along a dirt road, horn honking.
CLOSE ON PICKUP	The RANCHER from the mini-mart is driving; Giles beside him. We follow the cable fast, over to the side of the boxcar to
HALE	Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness.
HALE	Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.
THE GUNMAN	Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat
DEAKINS	Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof.
HALE	Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale
THE RED CROSS HELICOPTER	Hovers in sideways toward the train. The MAN in the doorway
DEAKINS	Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when...
HALE	Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot.
HALE AND DEAKINS	Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter
THE HELICOPTER	Moves sideways over the train. Deakins turns, pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as...
THE HELICOPTER	Moves back sideways over the train.
DEAKINS' POV	No sign of Hale on the train roof.
DEAKINS	Get us out of here!
THE PILOT	Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he gets an odd
THE HELICOPTER	Is hovering over the train, but it can't fly away because...
HALE	Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid.
THE HELICOPTER	Strains against the cable, but it doesn't snap.
DEAKINS	Hurry!
POWER LINES	Cross the track, a quarter-mile ahead.
DEAKINS	Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi, shooting down at...
HALE	Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the
DEAKINS	Sees what's coming and jumps.
THE HELICOPTER	Hits...
THE POWER LIKES	Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopter's rotor.
THE HELICOPTER	Breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on.
THE TOYOTA	Explodes.
ECU NUKE TIMER	Five minutes and counting.
HALE	Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears
DEAKINS	Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...
DEAKINS	They would've paid and I would've stopped it. You've made a very, very big mistake.
HALE	It's over, Deak. I beat you. Disarm it.
DEAKINS	If it's over and you beat me, you disarm it.
HALE	Deak...
DEAKINS	Course you are going to need this. All you have to do is get it. And if you do, as a special added bonus, you get this. Deakins pulls out...
THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL	Then pockets it.
HALE AND DEAKINS	Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.
DEAKINS	Ready? Hale puts up his fists.
BETWEEN BOXCAR AND CAR CARRIER	Terry is looking under the car carrier.
TERRY'S POV	The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat
DEAKINS	Modern boxing is a pussy sport. They want to make it about scoring points. It's not about scoring points! It's about this! Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the
DEAKINS	Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In the old fights, there'd be so much blood, guys would slip and fall. Let's see if we can't get a little more of that red goo out of you. Ready? Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but
CU TRAIN AXLE	The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.
TERRY	Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the
DEAKINS	Used to be, every fight was to a knockout. You know what happens when you get knocked out? It's your brain slapping against the inside of your skull. Here. I'll let you see what it's like. Ready? Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
HALE	Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above
THE TRAIN	Jumps the tracks.
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON	Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.
THE STRAPS	Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.
FLAMING TOYOTAS	Fly, tumble, explode. Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.
THE TRAIN	The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON	It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in
DEAKINS	Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the
HALE	Looks around for something. He sees it --
DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE	On the floor.
DEAKINS' EYES	Flicker open. He sees...
A PISTOL	Lying a few feet away. You have to push amber, then red. You might have time to push amber. You won't get to red. Hale turns to see...
DEAKINS	Pointing a gun at him.
HALE	The nuke is armed, Deak. If it falls, the impact trigger will set it off.
DEAKINS	I know.
HALE	Half a million people will die.
DEAKINS	Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
ONE OF THE STRAPS	Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.
HALE	His finger hovers over the amber button.
DEAKINS	Do it and I shoot. Hale looks at Deakins.
HALE	I guess you really don't know me that well after all. Hale presses the amber button.
DEAKINS	Shoots.
HALE	Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.
THE REMOTE	Falls from his hand.
DEAKINS	Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...
THE LAST STRAP	Rips through and...
THE NUKE	Drops toward him, point first.
HALE'S BLOODY HAND	Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.
ECU NUKE TIMER	Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...
DEAKINS	His eyes fill with true terror as...
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON	Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.
HALE	Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,
HALE	Ready. He heads out of the boxcar.
A TV NEWSVAN	Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.
HALE	Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe
A FOOT	In a boot, sticking out from under a burning Toyota.
HALE	Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off
HALE	Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no. Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...
TERRY (O.S.)	The Air Force pays you so little you have to steal shoes off dead people? Hale turns to see...
TERRY	Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.
WILKINS AND GILES	Are behind her, grinning.
HALE AND TERRY	Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's
REPORTER	What happened here? Hale and Wilkins and Giles share a look.
HALE	Uh... ... somebody was trying to steal some Toyotas. The reporter asks more questions. Hale and Terry walk off, arms
HALE	Rawley Hale.
TERRY	Terry Carmichael. They shake hands and walk on as we...
