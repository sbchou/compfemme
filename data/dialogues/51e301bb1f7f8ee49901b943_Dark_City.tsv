CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
HOTEL MANAGER O.S.	Hey, you! You gotta message.
WHITE	What?
MANAGER O.S.	Message in d'box! You deaf?
MANAGER O.S.	Got my money?
WHITE	What? I... How long have I been here?
MANAGER O.S.	Jeez, too damn long if you ask me! What about the two weeks y'owe me...
VOICE O.S.	What is your name... What is your name...
MANAGER O.S.	Hey! I'll be back later.
MANAGER O.S.	Yeah. Well, y'better be. Gesundheit! ...but you told me the meeting was ten-thirty.
BUMSTEAD	I know, sir, but I can't make it at nine-thirty... It's - um - well, inconvenient...
BUMSTEAD	Yes, sir... I understand... Yes... But, I've done fine so far without an assistant...
BUMSTEAD	But... But I... I... Nine-thirty. Yes.
VOICE O.S.	There you are.
MYSTERY MAN	You are lost, yes?
MYSTERY MAN	Co-operate. Do not make this difficult.
MYSTERY MAN	You will not shoot, yes. There is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness...
BUMSTEAD	Good evening, sir.
STROMBOLI	Yes. This way.
MORTICIAN	Welcome, gentlemen. Youíre early. Here for the examination, right?
STROMBOLI	The handiwork of an extremely sick individual.
STROMBOLI	Youíve read the reports. Not much to go on. We know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them... Always the same type of blade. Forensics match in each case... Anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself.
STROMBOLI	Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
BUMSTEAD	Germs, sir. These places are full of them.
STROMBOLI	I see. One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
MORTICIAN	You can say that again.
BUMSTEAD	What about Thompson, sir? Wasnít this his case?
STROMBOLI	Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. Anyway he isnít with us any longer. The case is yours. Go through his files. Take what you need. By the way, howís your mother?
BUMSTEAD	Sheís getting better, thanks. She... Very good...
STROMBOLI	Letís go, Bumstead. So much to do and so little time.
FIGURE 1	We are looking for Jonathan White.
MANAGER	What for?
MAN 1	Which room is he in?
WHITE (nods)	The noodles. Iíll have some noodles.
WOMAN	We call.
BUMSTEAD	A real shame... YAAAAAAAAAH!
MAN 1	Donít fall asleep. Might never wake, yes. Fifty-six.
VOICE	Fifty-six... Fifty-six... Where have you been? The doctorís been worried about you.
WHITE	What? Who are you?
FREDRICK	Címon, letís go! We donít have any time.
WHITE	Hold it a minute. Letís start at the beginning, huh?
FRERICK	Shit! Quick! Run!
WHITE	Shit.
COP	We got another one upstairs Great.
BUMSTEAD	Dammit!
MISS CRENSHAW	Sorry, sir.
BUMSTEAD	Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
MISS CRENSHAW	Patricia Crenshaw.
MISS CRENSHAW	Iím your new assistant.
BUMSTEAD	I didnít requisition a secretary.
MISS CRENSHAW	The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand. Oh.
MISS CRENSHAW	Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed. All clear now, sir. They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
BUMSTEAD	Good.
MISS CRENSHAW	You wonít regret this, sir.
BUMSTEAD	Fine.
WHITE	Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing?
LIBRARIAN	Which would you like first?
WHITE	Okay. Newspapers.
LIBRARIAN	Are you alright? Sure. Iím fine. Mmm-hmm. Stairs at the end of the hall. Third floor. Turn left. Section C-7. Row 35, near the toilets.
LIBRARIAN	Donít mention it...
WHITE	Iím trying to reach nine zero eight triple two. I canít get through... What?!... Shit!
WHITE	It is?... Which area is that number listed in?... Is that near the ocean?... The ocean... Never mind. Have a Jonathan White listed?... WHITE. Seventeen? All Johns? I see... Never mind.
CRENSHAW O.S.	Coffee?
BUMSTEAD	What? I donít drink coffee. A cup of tea would be good. Milk and no sugar.
CRENSHAW	Making progress?
BUMSTEAD	These are the investigations of a madman. He has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever. This is a mess. A horrible mess. Itís the second time now.
BUMSTEAD	Look at this!
BUMSTEAD	You typed this report?
MISS CRENSHAW	Yes, sir. Anything wrong?
BUMSTEAD	Wrong? Look at this!
MISS CRENSHAW	It seems fine.
BUMSTEAD	Fine? Look here!
BUMSTEAD	How can I submit this?
MISS CRENSHAW	Iím sorry...
BUMSTEAD	Do you wash your hands before you type things?
MISS CRENSHAW	Why, yes.
BUMSTEAD	Well be more careful, please.
CRENSHAW	Inspector Bumsteadís office... Yes... Yes...
MISS CRENSHAW	Yes, sir. The Chief-Inspector said he would see you now.
STROMBOLI O.S.	Enter!
STROMBOLI	What is it?
BUMSTEAD	A formality. I need to speak with Thompson. Officially I need your written permission.
STROMBOLI	Why do you want to speak to him?
BUMSTEAD	A hunch. He might be able to... Bumstead, donít be so paranoid. Leave him alone - heís a sad case.
BUMSTEAD	Itís extremely important to my investigation...
STROMBOLI	Iíll be the judge of that. Anything else?
BUMSTEAD	Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me... Absolutely not. Up to my ears in cases right now - canít spare anyone.
BUMSTEAD	Lost something?
STROMBOLI	What makes you think that! If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
WHITE	I need something to keep me awake.
BARBER	Looks like you need a haircut to me.
WHITE	Thanks. Just some pills.
BARBER	Only two bucks. Shave as well... Your sign says you sell drugs - well, Iím here to buy some. Okay?
BARBER	Relax. Sure!
BARBER	Tell you what - let me cut yer hair, give ya watcha need half price. Canít argue at that! I donít want a haircut.
BARBER (talks fast)	Cut hair when I was in the navy, yíknow - havenít lost the touch. Bet youíre happy ëbout that. Huh!
WHITE	Sell maps?
BARBER	What of? The city. I need to get to the ocean.
BARBER	Nope. No maps. Ocean, huh? On vacation?
BARBER	Grandpa thought customers might like some mood music. Nice...
BARBER	You still look familiar. Itís driving me nuts! Sure I donít know ya from somewhere? Not me.
BARBER	Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that?
WHITE	Not really...
BARBER	Yeah, Iím like that. Senility says the wife. But she sure canít complain. Heh. The erector set still works good. And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead. Feel it! All mine!
GRANDPA	Yes! Feeeeel it! THINK I MADE STUPID MISTAKE. HOPE THINGS DONíT GET BACK TO YOU. SORRY. - FREDRICK.
PRIEST	Beware! The night is deadly. There is a criminal among us.
PRIEST	It could be she! The innocent across the street!
PRIEST	Or the temptress next door!
PRIEST	Or mister nervy stranger at the back!
PRIEST	You are thinking it could be anyone? And youíre right! Why, it could even be Mother!
PRIEST (continues sermon)	Evil stalks our streets. It seeks to hide in our hearts. Have you not evil within you now?
GAUNT WOMAN	He took my little boy! Iíll rip out his eyes!
OLDER PRIEST	You have sinned?
WHITE	NO. Ah...
PRIEST	I am listening. Thereís a... woman. I don't know but I think I, ahh...
PRIEST	You fornicated?
WHITE	No. I, ah...
PRIEST	You seem restless.
WHITE	Someoneís after me.
PRIEST	Then we must call the police.
WHITE	No. I mean... that isnít necessary.
PRIEST	I see. Then who is after you? What sins have you committed?
WHITE	Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
PRIEST	Youíre the murderer? Yes! That must be it! Donít kill me!
WHITE	Shut up! Listen. Walk out quietly. Understand?
PRIEST	Donít kill me!
WHITE	Shut up!
PRIEST	Please...
WHITE (not so quietly)	Iím not going to kill you, okay! CRIMINAL! Itís him! Rip out his eyes! What do you want? Tell me! Do not make us hurt you...
MYSTERY MAN	It will be inconvenient, yes...
BUMSTEAD	How long have you been here?
COP	Maybe ten minutes... Thatís strange.
BUMSTEAD	Spinning backwards?
COP	Yours too?
BUMSTEAD	I want prints over here...
WHITE	I want to see the doctor. It's important.
NURSE	What time was your appointment? Look! Tell him I'm here. Now.
NURSE (scared/standing)	Yes, certainly... Who should I say?
WHITE	No idea. Just get him...
MAN 1	It has failed.
MAN 2	This is becoming dangerous, yes!
MAN 3	Let's get this over with.
MAN 5	What about the dance-steps! This is my responsibility, we must resolve this issue, yes?
MAN 5	Sorry.
MAN 3	The situation has changed. This one is in possession of knowledge... ...to avoid influence, yes.
MAN 4	A freak!
MAN 1	Impossible!
MAN 3	It gets interesting, yes.
MAN 2	Stop this! It has gone too far! Tell Mister Black!
SCHREBER	You remember nothing? Who you are? What you've done?
WHITE	You know something about me?
SCHREBER	Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try.
WHITE	You think I haven't been trying! It's like there was never anything there. Just water.
SCHREBER	Water?
WHITE	Waves... A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
SCHREBER	What does she say? The woman.
WHITE	Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can't answer. I've no idea what my name is.
SCHREBER	Your name is John White.
WHITE	That's what people keep telling me.
SCHREBER (indicates pills)	And what's this about? Why?
SCHREBER	Bad dreams?
WHITE	Yes.
SCHREBER	Tell me about them...
WHITE (interrupts)	Yeah well, why don't I ask some questions for a change.
SCHREBER	If you like.
WHITE	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
SCHREBER	That's right. I am your doctor.
WHITE	Known me for long?
SCHREBER	Well... Am I a killer?
SCHREBER	I cannot say... You don't know the answer to that?
WHITE	I told you, I can't remember a thing! Look, you know something about me, out with it! Let's end this bullshit! I want answers!
SCHREBER	We won't get anywhere like this. Please. Let's take things in easy steps...
SCHREBER	Put simply... a penetration of the left parieto-occipital area of the cranium... complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges. Without going into detail... the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles, producing incipient atrophy of the medulla... Look. It was a simple question. Can someone kill and not remember it? I'm sorry. I get carried away sometimes. Possible? I'm... ah, afraid so.
WHITE	Did she drown? The woman you told me about?
SCHREBER	Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
WHITE	Horrible...
SCHREBER	You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something.
SCHREBER	Formation of memories is the most important of brain functions.
SCHREBER	We are little more than a sum of memories. From them we reference who we are, where we're going. Without a past we are nothing. This is why you are so interesting.
WHITE	I'm nothing then.
SCHREBER	Anything but, my friend.
SCHREBER	It feels no pain.
WHITE	Can I get my life back?
SCHREBER	Maybe.
SCHREBER	We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory.
SCHREBER	And then there is procedural memory.
SCHREBER	Follow?
SCHREBER	Research on simple animals can be... useful. To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example. I am building an experiment with hamsters next. Cute little things.
SCHREBER	Listen to me talk! You must be hungry.
SCHREBER	Whole damn wing lost power. Wiring's old. Keep meaning to get it fixed. Here we are.
SCHREBER	Ah. Beautiful! Head and all! Just how I like 'em!
WHITE	I'm sorry. About before.
SCHREBER	I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though. Trust me completely. I'm here to help. I have to talk to you.
SCHREBER	It can't wait?
SCHREBER (to White)	Excuse me. Ah, make yourself at home.
WHITE	Still kicking, huh?
SCHREBER O.S.	How are things in here?
SCHREBER	Ah, nearly done. So tell me about your dreams. I'm very interested.
WHITE	Just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind. You know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing...
SCHREBER	Ah, our friends in black... they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real.
SCHREBER	I know everything about you. You have no choice but to trust me.
SCHREBER	Scarey, isn't it?
SCHREBER	Are you feeling alright?
SCHREBER	What are you doing?
WHITE	I have to go...
SCHREBER	You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about...
SCHREBER	You're tired. You need to lie down.
WHITE	Those pills... Yes. A little something to help you relax. Harmless...
FOETUS 1	This is madness. If we're caught...
FOETUS 2	Shut-up. Help me with these straps...
SCHREBER (holds syringe up)	Now you must relax, Anton.
SCHREBER	Leave it!
SCHREBER	Damn! Whoever it is - get rid of them!
NURSE	Keys.
SCHREBER	I'm sorry I had to put you through this, Anton. There will be some pain, but things will be easier this way.
BUMSTEAD	Hold it!
BUMSTEAD	Police. Nobody move.
SCHREBER	He tried to kill me!
BUMSTEAD	Shut up! Everybody stay calm... You Schreber?
BUMSTEAD	What's that? A fish, huh?
BUMSTEAD	Dammit! I'm curious? How many so far?
WHITE (confused)	What? I... Let's see, there's the little guy with no arms or legs. And the young boy? Young boy?
BUMSTEAD	The six year old. Sure, you remember. Y'know, the kid you left in the meat packing plant, cut into pieces. Packed into brown paper parcels, wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.
BUMSTEAD	You sure have demonstrated a great deal of... imagination. The baby was the best though. Several cops lost their lunch over that one. Head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech... Stop it. You're making me sick...
BUMSTEAD	We count seven so far. Anyone we missed?
VOICE	Inspector Bumstead... Inspector...
BUMSTEAD	What is it, Crenshaw?
CRENSHAW	Just reminding you... your eight pee em...
BUMSTEAD	Dammit. Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch. It needs fixing.
CRENSHAW	Yes sir.
WHITE	Where are we going?
BUMSTEAD	Shut-up.
WHITE (quietly)	Shit!
BUMSTEAD	Gesundheit! I didn't sneeze. What are we doing here?
BUMSTEAD	Get out.
BUMSTEAD	Wait here.
BUMSTEAD	Bumstead. I'm here to see my mother. Brought you these. Move - forward.
MECHANICAL VOICE	Left - profile.
MECHANICAL VOICE	Right - profile.
MECHANICAL VOICE	Move - forward.
VOICE	Move - forward.
VOICE	Watch - the - wheel.
VOICE	Move - forward.
VOICE	Stand - behind - the - screen.
VOICE	Move - forward.
VOICE	Face - the - wall.
VOICE	What's your name? I don't remember.
VOICE	Oh, no?
STROMBOLI	John...
STROMBOLI	...Murderer.
STROMBOLI	You'll sign a confession?
BUMSTEAD (into speaker)	Okay.
GUARD	Visitor. Keep him away: He's insane.
SCHREBER	Please, stay calm. This man wants to kill me. Just one of his many delusions - it's nothing. Shut up! Listen, damn you! This is a fortunate coincidence - we won't get another chance like this. Listen to me. What do you want?
SCHREBER	You're innocent... You didn't kill anyone. What am I doing in here then?
SCHREBER	Listen to what I have to say. Decide for yourself.
BUMSTEAD	What's he doing here?
COP	Says he is the man's doctor... You know...
BUMSTEAD	I know it's his doctor... I need the file on.. Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S.	Schreber. Yes. Isn't that his doctor? Yes. And it's SCHREBER - with an 'h'.
MISS CRENSHAW	Yes. An "h".
SCHREBER	The men in black - they're the killers.
WHITE	You're a liar!
SCHREBER	No, it's the truth.
WHITE	So you're telling me the truth this time? Is that it!
SCHREBER	If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
WHITE	Not that again...
SCHREBER	Everyone get's one - very much like this... But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything... I'm not injecting anything into my brain.
SCHREBER	Anton - I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment. I arranged it. It was a lie from the beginning. It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have. You have been left - blank.
SCHREBER	You can change this, all this. But you must take it.
WHITE	You've been working too hard.
SCHREBER	Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
WHITE	Why?
SCHREBER	Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it.
SCHREBER	Concentrate. Imagine the syringe rising. Picture it floating above the table.
SCHREBER	Do it!
WHITE	It's a trick.
SCHREBER	No it isn't. You are doing it! Now raise it over the glass and...
WHITE	Oh, sorry...
MECHANICAL VOICE	Your - time - is - up. I gave you your chance, now it's too late. They'll learn you are here soon. It's all over.
BUMSTEAD	Doctor! What brings you here?
SCHREBER	Just visiting my patient.
BUMSTEAD	Really? And how is his state of mind?
SCHREBER	He's seriously disturbed...
BUMSTEAD	You seem a little edgy. Everything okay?
SCHREBER	Yes, of course. Everything's fine...
BUMSTEAD	To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this. Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
SCHREBER	Loose ends?
VOICE O.S.	Bumstead!
STROMBOLI	I need to speak to you. Immediately.
STROMBOLI	Bumstead, these... er, gentlemen are here to collect White. Who are you? Please, Bumstead. Co-operate - it's easier.
BUMSTEAD	This is highly irregular. I have a right to know.
MAN 1	We are from a mental asylum.
STROMBOLI	Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help.
BUMSTEAD	I see...
MAN 1	Yes, Inspector. Has he been displaying any strange... behaviour?
BUMSTEAD	He's been a little angel...
STROMBOLI	If you could show them to the holding cell now.
MAN 1	Where is he?
BUMSTEAD	Yes, sir. I'm sorry... But I don't understand how it was possible. The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
STROMBOLI	How could you have been so stupid?
COP	I'm sorry, sir.
STROMBOLI	Alright, get out.
STROMBOLI	You stay.
STROMBOLI	Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me. This case is very important to me. Just a little warning: I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
BUMSTEAD	Yes, sir.
NEWS READER O.S.	...earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended.
NEWS READER O.S.	...and now for a message from LUMP-O food products...
JAPANESE WOMAN	He's up here! He raped me! Hurry! Before he kills again! Sachiko.
WHITE	That's me. I'm a shadow.
WHITE	Do I look like a murderer to you?
WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.	Yes?... Who is this?... Who's there?...
WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.	John? Is that you?
WHITE	Who is this? What do you know about me?
WOMAN	John.
WOMAN	Please believe me. It's me, John. Your WIFE. I wouldn't lie to you. You told me I could come and see you - now you want to just send me away again...
WHITE	I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life... It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.
WHITE	How do you know I'm innocent?
WIFE	Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...
WHITE	I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
WIFE	They're dead, John.
WIFE	You have an uncle. You were very close.
WIFE	This is where he lives. I'm sure he would like to see you. Thanks. Don't you want me? My body? Remember how my skin feels? Touch it. I...
WHITE	What's your name? Elizabeth. Yes...
ELIZABETH	I want to help...
WHITE	Alright. Here...
WHITE	Know this place? Of course. Your home town - where you grew up...
WHITE	How do I get there? Tell me.
WIFE	That's easy. You...
ELIZABETH	...strange, I forgot.
WHITE	Yes. Very strange.
THOMPSON	Go away!
BUMSTEAD O.S.	Open up, Thompson. It's me...
THOMPSON	Bumstead?
THOMPSON	Can't let you in... sorry.
BUMSTEAD	I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
THOMPSON	Not that. Anything else.
BUMSTEAD	You don't look so well... C'mon, let me in Thompson.
THOMPSON	I can't talk about that. As long as you understand, that's all.
THOMPSON	Pull up some garbage - make yourself at home.
THOMPSON	They've taken my mind, my memories...
BUMSTEAD	What? Who has?
THOMPSON	Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.
BUMSTEAD	What is going on?
THOMPSON (looks more frightened)	Wish I could tell you, Bumstead. Strange business. I... AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
THOMPSON	Get away! Leave me alone!
THOMPSON	It's - it's disgusting, I know...
BUMSTEAD	Jesus! We have to get you to a doctor...
THOMPSON	No... No doctor...
BUMSTEAD	But... How long has this been happening?
THOMPSON	A few days... a few weeks - dunno, I can't remember. Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again... Now, please leave me alone. Sorry... I'm sorry... This is embarrassing - my husband doesn't know who I am...
MYSTERY MAN	The line of junction between two edges! YES!
MYSTERY MAN	We have located him. Now is the time, yes.
MYSTERY MAN	Let the tuning commence!
COP	All the same entry wounds. It's definitely him. She lives... lived here. A prostitute.
BUMSTEAD	The other one?
COP	His wife.
BUMSTEAD	Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
COP	No one available.
YOUNG COP	They won't come out.
COP	We'll interrogate them anyway.
COP	This is the family of the victim - apparently they were in the apartment when he committed... What are you talking about?
COP	Oh, yes...
COP	They don't speak English...
BUMSTEAD	How will we interrogate them?
COP	Well, sir... I don't know exactly.
BUMSTEAD	It's alright. I won't hurt you. Gentlemen. Doctor.
MISTER BLACK	I have called this meeting for a purpose, yes? It is clear to you we are - unhappy, yes?
SCHREBER	Yes, of course. I...
MISTER BLACK	The tuning failed - when our agents arrived he was gone. He knows things - predicts things. Explain to us, Doctor. Why is the situation this way? Yes?
SCHREBER	I'm not certain I fully understand myself...
MISTER BLACK	No excuses, dearest Doctor! Answers. Yes? Answers! Answers!
MISTER BLACK	You said this would be containable! Nothing works this time. Why is this so?
MYSTERY MEN	Why! Why!
SCHREBER	I - ah - I... it's a little cold in here don't you think?
MISTER BLACK	We must find him. This is your responsibility. Yes, of course... A call, sir.
BUMSTEAD	Who is it?
MISS CRENSHAW	Won't say. Says he must talk to you.
BUMSTEAD	Put it through...
BUMSTEAD	This is Bumstead. Who is this?
BUMSTEAD	I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
MISS CRENSHAW	Yes, sir. Everything?
BUMSTEAD	All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.
BUMSTEAD	Please - I'm in a hurry. Certainly.
BUMSTEAD	Why give yourself up?
WHITE	I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.
BUMSTEAD	That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
WHITE	I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there. Uh-huh. What are you scared of?
WHITE	People... after me.
BUMSTEAD	Who?
WHITE	I don't know who they are.
BUMSTEAD	Why are they after you?
WHITE	Don't know that either.
BUMSTEAD	Don't know much, do you?
VOICE	What is your name... What is your name...
MISTER BLACK	You have duplicated the personality, yes.
MAN 3	It is ready. The Doctor was most helpful.
MISTER BLACK	I hear a clock in my head, and I like it! We hear clocks in our heads, and we like it!
MISTER BLACK	A world in our likeness!
MEN	A world in our likeness!
BUMSTEAD	Please. Not that way. If you could just follow the covering - the carpet gets stained and it's impossible to clean.
BUMSTEAD	Everything the department knows about John White is in this. Here. Excuse me for a moment. Age thirty one. Brown hair. Green eyes. Five feet, ten and a half inches tall. Until recently worked for a firm manufacturing scientific equipment. Wife's name - Elizabeth. Father and mother - Harold and Edith. Both dead. A history of mental instability... etcetera, etcetera.
BUMSTEAD	That stuff helpful? I suppose... Why are you helping me?
BUMSTEAD	You're case has been driving me crazy. You see, I pride myself on being thorough. There's too many loose ends with your case. Thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts. What do you know about these men in black?
WHITE	If you shoot them here... you can kill them. They're not people - like us - got insects in their heads... Got any disinfectant?
WHITE (continues)	It's my legs. Been bitten. Giving me trouble. Insects?
BUMSTEAD	Here. Careful with your trousers. That stuff stains.
BUMSTEAD	Here.
BUMSTEAD	Any idea what part the Doctor plays in this business?
BUMSTEAD	Let's try and find out, shall we. Lace is untied.
BARBER	He with you shortly, sir... Hello, sonny. Cute outfit. Mother get it for you? EEEEEEEEK... AHHHHHHH!... SHHHHIIIITTTT!... FUUUUCKER!! Huh?
BUMSTEAD	I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you. It started with two little girls. Twins. Used to play with them when I was young. Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why...
BUMSTEAD	They didn't have faces.
WHITE	What?
BUMSTEAD	That's right. Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads. No mistake. I just hadn't remembered it that way. Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. That's not all. Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies. It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event. Then I would turn the lights off. Sit down in a comfortable chair... And study each detail of this subject.
BUMSTEAD	Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me...
BUMSTEAD	Is there anything you haven't told me about this business? Even the most insignificant thing? No. Nothing I can think of. Except...
BUMSTEAD	Go on.
WHITE	Well. The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean. The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
BUMSTEAD	Why, that's ridiculous. You just...
BUMSTEAD	We'll get to the bottom of this. I mean it.
BUMSTEAD	I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin...
SCHREBER	I don't know what you're talking about.
BUMSTEAD	That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
SCHREBER	You are mistaken.
WHITE	What are you hiding?
SCHREBER	Nothing. I don't know anything!
SCHREBER	Please, they'll kill me...
BUMSTEAD	I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
SCHREBER	In there.
BUMSTEAD	Just like that?
BUMSTEAD	What is this place?
SCHREBER	You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself.
WHITE	Look.
SCHREBER	Put them on.
SCHREBER	Get in. Hurry.
WHITE	Where do you think this goes?
BUMSTEAD	It sure isn't the fun-fair.
SCHREBER	Follow me, and do exactly as I do. Eleven past eleven - the Night of the Eye.
MEN	NIGHT OF THE EYE! NIGHT OF THE EYE!
MAN 2	The Eye is too small for the head of the pin!
MAN 1	Yes!
MAN 3	What is it that floats on the water? The Eye!
MAN 1	Indeed! What do we do? Fake it!
BUMSTEAD	What?
SCHREBER	The eye. Master of time and space!
BUMSTEAD	The Eye - um - delicious with horseradish on rye! Good.
BUMSTEAD	Nothing to it...
WHITE	Eye... eye, captain!
MAN 1	Um - yes...
MAN 4	My spine will bend for the Eye!
BUMSTEAD	Was that for real down there?
SCHREBER	I'm afraid so.
BUMSTEAD	What the hell is that?
BUMSTEAD	Quick. My car. What now?
BUMSTEAD	This ocean business... I know where I can find a map. I need to go back to the station. Where will you be?
WHITE	I'll go see an uncle of mine. Five - one - eight - three - double six - three...
BUMSTEAD	Good. Uh-oh... It's empty.
BUMSTEAD	Take mine.
PUPPET	ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!... HA-HA-HA-HA- HA!! Where did it go? Don't know.
BUMSTEAD	Jump!
TICKET SELLER	Yeah. That's what I said! What..?
WHITE	I'm looking for this address.
TICKET SELLER	Upstairs. Through there.
VOICE O.S.	John?
MAN	Are you alright? What are you doing here? Is this one of your jokes, John? It's been so long, I thought you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?
WHITE	Uncle... Karl.
KARL (chuckling)	Not often I get a chance to show these.
KARL	And this is me again about - um - I would guess about twelve feet further to the right of the last shot. Now just behind the wall is the hotel I stayed at - sweet little place... Hello... Yes, he's here... It's for you.
WHITE	Yes? Oh, it's you... Yes... My uncle apparently... Just looking at some memories... You have? That's good.
BUMSTEAD	At first I thought there was no way to get to the ocean... The buildings are a barrier, no windows, no doors - everything just, well, ends - only thing would be drill a hole. But then, I saw it, one door, just one... Inside a tenement building... We can meet later - but first I have to do something. Look I got to go...
WHITE	Where can we meet?... Alright. Good...
KARL	Look! This is a good one!
WHITE	What is that door?
KARL	Which one?
WHITE	There. Behind the cabinet. Where does it go?
KARL	Such a joker! Like your father.
WHITE	No. Have a look.
WHITE	You see it?
KARL	Yes.
WHITE	Where does it lead?
KARL	It must be a closet or something.
KARL	Don't trip over. It's dark up there.
KARL	John, I didn't see you there.
KARL	What is that? Get back!
KARL	Filthy beast! Shoo! Go on! Shoo!
WHITE	No!
BUMSTEAD	I can't wait any longer...
NURSE	I'm sorry. I told you, she is being examined...
NURSE	Mister Bumstead!
SURGEON	We will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs. Yes. What is happening?
SURGEON	Ah, Inspector Bumstead! We are glad you are here - I'm afraid we have done all we can. Yes. Your Mother has passed. Yes.
BUMSTEAD	But she was getting better...
SURGEON	We are sorry. The cancer - it was fatal.
BUMSTEAD	She doesn't have cancer.
SURGEON	We knew that. Yes. Anyway - she is dead. I'll kill you all!
MYSTERY MAN	You will obey us, yes. In your mind there is a dark space...
WHITE	Nice knowing you.
BUMSTEAD	White?
STROMBOLI (walking forward)	Hello, Bumstead.
BUMSTEAD	Dammit.
STROMBOLI	Why do you always have to find things out the hard way! Couldn't you just do your job, you idiot? I told you, didn't I? These people are not playing games, Bumstead. They can do anything they want, don't you understand? You're one of them. You bastard...
STROMBOLI (laughing)	In a way, we all are, inspector! You. Me. Everybody!
STROMBOLI	Time for that early retirement, Bumstead. Didn't bring the gold watch I'm afraid. No... Please...
FIGURE	Ahhh... it hurts!...
WHITE	What happened to you?
SCHREBER	I'm... being... punished.
SCHREBER	I had to - ahhhh - find you... I.. I...
WHITE	What is it?
SCHREBER	We are... living in their dreams...
SCHREBER	Insect... dreams...
WHITE (reading)	Aitch?
BUMSTEAD	Gesundheit!
WHITE	I didn't sneeze.
MAN 1	We are looking for the White victims.
MORTICIAN	And who the hell are you?
MORTICIAN	Over there. Numbers eight to twelve.
MAN 1	Thank you.
VOICE O.S.	John White...
MYSTERY MAN	There is nothing, Mister White. Beyond the city. Never has been. Unfortunate. Yes?
WHITE	How did you know where to find me?
MYSTERY MAN	We knew you would turn up here eventually... Been waiting for you, yes. Hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way...
MISTER BLACK	Welcome.
MISTER BLACK	John White, you are to be tried for murder, yes. You wish to confess to these crimes now?
MISTER BLACK	Very well. The testimony of the prosecutors. Yes.
MYSTERY MAN 2	We will show that John White is abnormal, a menace to society, a dangerous sick individual, and that the court should have no mercy in finding him guilty and punishable to the extreme for his crimes.
MYSTERY MAN 1	Exhibit A shows the accused leaving the scene of his most recent crime, yes. A photo taken by a remote camera planted by one of our agents.
MYSTERY MAN 2	Exhibit B...
MYSTERY MAN 2	Actual tape recording of accused committing aforementioned crime, yes. No... Please... Shut up! John! Don't... Stop it! This is a lie...
MISTER BLACK	Something to say? Ready to confess? I didn't kill anyone.
MISTER BLACK	Speak up. Yes. It's lies. Everything.
MISTER BLACK	Bring the witnesses.
MISTER BLACK	You are the accused's parents?
FATHER	That's right.
MOTHER	Yes.
WHITE	Wait a minute...
MISTER SLACK	You had your turn! Let them speak. My parents are supposed to be dead! You can't keep changing the damn rules like this! Why go through this ridiculous set-up! Why don't you just kill me and be done with it!
MISTER BLACK (smiles at parents)	Please, continue...
WHITE	This is insane!
WHITE	It was them, not me. They killed you.
WHITE	You have invented all this. History is a lie, not just mine, everyone's - a fiction. You are the authors.
MISTER BLACK	A fanciful idea, Mister White.
WHITE	Everyone has a job - a function. Each one teaches you more about your invention. I'm what is called a murderer.
WHITE	You've given everybody memories, but I missed out. The Doctor saw to that - played your own game. And now...
WHITE	You're trying to get rid of me.
WHITE	Why do I threaten you? You're scared aren't you?
MISTER BLACK	Ah - a plot. Now we have a plot! Very inventive...
MOTHER	Please, John, you're embarrassing us...
WHITE	Shut up! You have proof? Evidence? Yes? It's all here!
MISTER BLACK	A book of delusions. Anything else?
WHITE	But I...
MISTER BLACK	I see. The verdict, yes...
WHITE	Wait, this isn't fair... Guil - ty...
MISTER BLACK	Before I pronounce sentence...
MISTER BLACK	How dare you use your tricks on me!
WHITE	I didn't realise...
MISTER BLACK	Shut up, freak! Monster! You are insignificant.
MISTER BLACK	You'll regret that. SHUT IT DOWN!
MAN ON PHONE	Yes, we have a problem here. Shut it down immediately.
MISTER BLACK	This has all gone too far. Yes, much too far.
FIGURE	Good as new. Yes. Everything is easier now.
FAT MAN	It's small but clean... ...and the view's nice. Isn't it? I'll take it. Beautiful.
WHITE	Yes...
WOMAN	What's your name?
WHITE	John... White.
