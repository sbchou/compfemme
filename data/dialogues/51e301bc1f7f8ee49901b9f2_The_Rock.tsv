CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
BENNIE	You'll get used to him. Every Sunday morning - rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away.
HUMMEL	Hi Barb. The house sold yesterday. I know, I know, the market's depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area. Some things I have to do. Things I couldn't do while you were here. Maybe you would have approved. Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention. But now they'll learn how it
ARMY M. P.	General Hummel, sir. It's an honour. Is the Colonel expecting you, sir?
HUMMEL	Held better be. This is a security inspection.
ARMY M. P.	Yes, sir!
COLONEL CALLAHAN	General Hummel! This is a surprise!
HUMMEL	That's the idea, Colonel.
SGT. CRISP	This is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and infiltrated your compound. I'm afraid you and your men are my prisoners, sir.
SGT. CRISP	Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.
HUMMEL	Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel. Here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator. This is not a tight ship. I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.
ISHERWOOD	Son of a bitch...
GOODSPEED	You owe me five dollars, Marvin.
ISHERWOOD	I was told this was exciting work.
GOODSPEED	Patience, Marvin. It has its moments. and shows it. A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian
ISHERWOOD	Bosnian refugee camp? I don't get it.
GOODSPEED	Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin. Serbians don't like Bosnians. Read a newspaper. It's good for you. Hold out your hand. does so. It's shaky.
ISHERWOOD	I'm okay. Really. Let's do it-
GOODSPEED	Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.
DR. LING	We have airlock, Bill. Proceed.

ISHERWOOD	This is thrilling.
GOODSPEED	Careful, goddamn it Marvin!
ISHERWOOD	What's hap... what's happening....?
DR. LING	Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear. You're okay. grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and
GOODSPEED	I've got some bad news and some really bad news. The bad news is the gas is corrosive. It's eating our suits. What's the really bad news.
GOODSPEED	Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas
ISHERWOOD	The acid's eating... it's eating my fucking suit...
GOODSPEED	Chill, Marvin. WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS?
DR. LONNER	Something's blocking the pipes, Bill. When in Christ's name
DR. LING	Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin.
DR. LING	You die, we all die, Bill. Inject yourself, then diffuse it. Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.
GOODSPEED	Get that away from me. I hate needles. INJECT YOURSELF! LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER?
DR. LONNER	It's coming, it's coming ...
DR. LING	Ten seconds, Bill.
ISHERWOOD	Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY IT'S REAL. drops the syringe. Fumbles for another... GOODSPEED,
DR. LING	Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ...
DR. LING	Three, two... the gas is clear!
DR. LING	Next time use the atropine!
GOODSPEED	I don't like needles.
CARLA	Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, (notices Goodspeed)
CARLA	Hey there.
GOODSPEED	Hey honey.
CARLA	Wrote a new song. Wanna hear it?
GOODSPEED	Not now.
CARLA	Boy, somebody's in a bad mood.
GOODSPEED	Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood.
CARLA	Better?
GOODSPEED	Much better. She sits with him. Puts her arm around him.
CARLA	What happened baby. Tell me.
GOODSPEED	Had a close one.
CARLA	You want to talk about it?
GOODSPEED	Not really.
CARLA	You know how I feel about what you do.
GOODSPEED	Could we change the subject?
CARLA	That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
GOODSPEED	Hey! Now there's some good news.
CARLA	You think I'm too... ethnic for country music?
GOODSPEED	Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You could have posed for the Mona Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you. I hope that's a compliment. I could change my name. How 'bout Bobby Sue Pestalozzi? Billy io Pestalozzi?
GOODSPEED	Stick with Carla.
CARLA	Okay. How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? Six years, Bill. We've lived together six years.
GOODSPEED	We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, inside and out ... Billy, this probably isn't the best time ... Bill, I'm uhhh.
CARLA	I'm pregnant. GOODSPEED
PARK RANGER JOE	Alcatraz - "the Rock" - is the most famous, and was the most feared, prison ever built. Here the inmates were allowed one hour
FEMALE TOURIST	Is it really true no one escaped?
PARK RANGER JOE	True, madam. From 1936 until the prison's closing in 1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one's believed to have made
PARK RANGER JOE	Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly; Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells.
PARK RANGER JOE	Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S. Park Service cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz - temporarily of tourists laugh and move inside the cells.
ALCATRAZ PARK RANGER	You're not supposed to leave the tour, guys. Is there a problem?
SGT. CRISP	Big problem.
PARK RANGER JOE	Don't want to be locked up, fellahs?
HUMMEL	Not today. You go ahead.
PARK RANGER JOE	I don't think so hah hah.
HUMMEL	I think so.
TOURISTS	Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going on... ?
CAPTAIN FRYE	General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow.
HUMMEL	Deploy as planned, Captain. Aye, aye, sir.
HUMMEL	Hello Ladies and Gentlemen. You are my prisoners. I have no intention of harming you. You will be fed regularly. That is all you need to know for now.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Can it wait till morning, Agent Wood, I'm going to hear Bruce Springsteen ...
AGENT WOOD	In that?
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Christ, the concert's for the Prince of Wales or somebody ...
AGENT WOOD	I really think you should take this call personally.
HUMMEL	First: I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on Alcatraz Island. Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Wait. Who is this?
HUMMEL	Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Mary Jane, get the Pentagon! (to Agent Wood) Call the San Francisco office. It seems Alcatraz was just re-opened.
HUMMEL	At ease, Gentlemen. It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation. The heart performs one thing, the legs adjutant in the Gulf. Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a beatnik. You and your men are new to me.
CAPTAIN FRYE	Would the General like a recitation of our service records?
HUMMEL	I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are excellent. I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here. You
CAPTAIN FRYE	Profit is not my motive, sir. I am here to redress a wrong.
CAPTAIN DARROW	Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.
HUMMEL	This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law. In the military, they are called
CAPTAIN DARROW	Well, sir, frankly ... EL I see that I am '
HUMMEL	The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. Plain and simple. An insurrection against a government to which we have
HUMMEL	The question is what kind of traitor are we. Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson? I have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear. Have all of you?
HUMMELS' OFFICERS	Yes, sir.
HUMMEL	Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not return. All of you can live with that?
OTHER OFFICERS	Yes, sir.
HUMMEL	Well, I cannot. So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX	But General, you'll be prosecuted.
HUMMEL	Yes, Captain. And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take
GENERAL KRAMER	Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets. It wasn't
GENERAL KRAMER	Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR	Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal of... Jesus. The man is a hero.
GENERAL KRAMER	A legend. During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C. single-handedly. Saved his whole company. Hence the nickname "gunfighter."
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? Anybody read it?
RAYDEN SINCLAIR	No. Give me the skinny.
GENERAL KRAMER	The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting
NAVAL ATTACHE	General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the table.
GENERAL KRAMER	Frank, this is Albert Kramer.
HUMMEL	Hello Al. Howlre Judy and the kids?
GENERAL KRAMER	They're fine. I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I. Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom, and C.I.A. Director Amway. You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. Can you help us out?
HUMMEL	I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR	Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into China.
HUMMEL	Who is that. Identify yourself.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR	White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.
HUMMEL	How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.
RAYDEN SINCLAIR	I'm thirty-three.
HUMMEL	Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday
NAVAL ATTACHE	The President calling from Moscow.
GENERAL KRAMER	Continue Frank.
HUMMEL	Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen. No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred. These men died for their country and they weren't even given This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families. The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that?
HUMMEL	Identify yourself.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	F.B.I. Director Womack, General.
HUMMEL	You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.
GENERAL KRAMER	Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.
WOMACK	Is this true?
HUMMEL	If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from. Good luck.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR	General, I've just spoken to the President and he is clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care if ...
HUMMEL	Someone please gag that man. Alert the media, I launch the gas. Refuse payment, I launch the gas.
GENERAL KRAMER	What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with V.X., General Peterson?
GENERAL PETERSON	In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...
RAYDEN SINCLAIR	Well that's not so bad ...
I GENERAL PETERSON	Thousand. Seventy thousand. Dead. one teaspoon will kill all living organisms in a three story office building. Get the
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?
GENERAL PETERSON	Napalm. Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm. It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation. The problem is that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. 'Course he does. "Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still That explains Hummells time frame. He knows we're not operational. What would it take, General?
GENERAL PETERSON	To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36 hours? An act of God. All right, we can try. But view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.
GENERAL KRAMER	Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. (to F.B.I. Womack) Who's your
AGENT WOOD	I'll find out.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Tell him to pack a bag for San Francisco.
CARLA	Don't stop... do no stop.
GOODSPEED	Shit, shit, shit what time is it. Hello. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
GOODSPEED	I've got to go to San Francisco. No. I'm sorry, but NO. I need you here with me. We need to talk about this...
GOODSPEED	I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't... I cannot deal with this right now ... (softly) Bill, I am very Catholic.
GOODSPEED	I love you. I will marry you. I just didn't plan on this, that's all. Tell you what: come to San Francisco.
CARLA	Really? Really?
GOODSPEED	It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...
CARLA	... We'll finish what we started. Baby, are you sexy in those boots ... A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind - intelligence.
GENERAL KRAMER	You've studied the architectural plans.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	They're useless. Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort. It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years. Under there is a maze What I need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels.
GENERAL KRAMER	The former warden?
AGENT WOOD	Died in 1979. The guards we contacted are useless. There was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he
GENERAL PETERSON	Didn't three guys escape? I thought I saw a movie about it.
AGENT WOOD	It's a Hollywood myth. No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	There is someone who can help us.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	The C.I.A. Director and I have something to discuss in private.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You're not actually suggesting ...
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	The man spent every night for six months making a dry-run of his escape. He knows every inch of that island. We have to,
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I am very uncomfortable about this.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I knew, I knew someday, this would come back to bite us.
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly. When was the last time you saw him?
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	when he escaped from San Quentin.
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	The man was an S.A.S. trained killer.
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	Can we risk letting.him out?
C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY	The question is: can we not? now, we have no idea why.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'm told you're our best chemical weapons man, Goodspeed. What's your education?
GOODSPEED	B.A. Columbia. M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology. Excellent. What do you know about V.X. gas?
GOODSPEED	This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	No Goodspeed. It's not a training exercise.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	The following is a state secret. Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution. His name is John Mason. A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962,
AGENT SANCHEZ	Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ...
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez. Do not argue and do not question. He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin, I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took through the island's tunnels.
AGENT SANCHEZ	You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Don't even entertain it. This man laughs at strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either.
GOODSPEED	Why's he going to help us now? Mason's papers are in order, sir.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon.
AGENT SANCHEZ	Steep price for some information. (waves pardon away) I don't need that to get what you want.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Sanchez - try subtlety.
AGENT SANCHEZ	It's my middle name. Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ...
GOODSPEED	Jesus look at this guy.
SANCHEZ	I'm F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Sanchez.
MASON	In charge of what? Fucking me over for another three decades?
SANCHEZ	Hey. Easy. I just want to talk.
MASON	You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez? Fucking Bloody Idiots. I don't want to talk to you.
SANCHEZ	Just some questions about Alcatraz. It's a tourist attraction now. You remember Alcatraz, Mason.
MASON	Do I remember Alcatraz.
SANCHEZ	Not the island itself. The tunnels underneath it. Real subtle, SANCHEZ... There's no harm in cooperating with us.
MASON	Who's "us?" F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do that?
SANCHEZ	Maybe there's a gift in it for you.
MASON	Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.
GOODSPEED	"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."
MASON	Are you capable of reading, Sanchez?
SANCHEZ	I don't have time for this shit... Yes. I can read.
MASON	The story of Alchimadus. Know it?
SANCHEZ	No.
GOODSPEED	Ancient Greece. Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
MASON	Thomas a Beckett. Heard of him?
SANCHEZ	Maybe. Not really.
GOODSPEED	Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
MASON	Solzhenitsyn. I've a sneaking suspicion you've heard of him. Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.
SANCHEZ	Look, I'm asking the fucking questions here. You can trust the F.B.I.
MASON	That's a good one, Sanchez. What do you call and F.B.I. Agent who can't tell a lie? A mute. longer exists. Suddenly, over a INTERCOM:
U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS	Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word with you?
SANCHEZ	Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail. Impressive, Sanchez.
GOODSPEED	You mind if... uhm.... I take a shot?
SANCHEZ	He'll eat him alive.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	He's already had you for the first course. Go.
GOODSPEED	Take his cuffs off.
MASON	Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa?
GOODSPEED	No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. Mr. Mason, we really need your help. That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office. It makes you a free man,
MASON	What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED	I'm a field agent.
MASON	Tell me what you really do. Don't answer that, GOODSPEED ....
GOODSPEED	I'm a chemical biological weapons expert. at the pardon contract, thinking.
MASON	You said I'd be a free man. Define free
GOODSPEED	Uhm, well, emancipated. Unfettered.
MASON	I know what the fucking word means, idiot. In this context.
GOODSPEED	I don't understand....
MASON	During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
GOODSPEED	Well yes I suppose ...
MASON	You suppose?
GOODSPEED	Yes. You'll be outside.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed.
MASON	What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?
GOODSPEED	A hostage situation. A matter of life and death.
MASON	Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists. I want a shower and a new
GOODSPEED	I think we can arrange that. GOODSPEED enter.
SANCHEZ	Why didn't you throw in a trip to Fiji?
U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS	I'll have this forwarded to the President, Director. No. You'll give it to me. Give it to me, Reynolds.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Show Attorney Reynolds outside there's a car waiting for him. And SANCHEZ -
GOODSPEED	Sir, that's a legal document.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'll decide what's legal, Goodspeed. AS --
GOODSPEED	those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn: had something in common. up the coin. It has a DEEP BURR it. He moves to the mirror; begins carving into the glass.
GOODSPEED	They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong. What's going on, sir?
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You're out of your depth, Goodspeed. You are on a need to know basis and you do not need to know.
MASON	one more thing: a shave and a haircut. Hello Womack.
CPT. GILER	What it's all about, sir: Willy Peter burns steel, burns titanium; it'll sure burn up your poison and everything else in the atmosphere.
GENERAL PETERSON	I need four F-16's equipped with air-to-ground missiles within... .... twenty-six hours.
LT. FISK	Let me name some things that are more possible, General, with
CPT. GILER	Can't do it, General.
GENERAL PETERSON	You can. And you will.
CPT. GILER	Get yer minds off Budweiser, baseball, and broads, fellahs - we're goin, ,round the clock!
CARLA	Hi! Bill and Carla ain't in! State your business! Make it interesting!
GOODSPEED	Listen Carla: I'll explain later, but don't come to San Francisco.
GOODSPEED	I repeat, don't come to San Francisco.
CARLA	Like hell I'm not... that MASON is staring at him.
MASON	Who's Carla? And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco?
GOODSPEED	You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.
MASON	You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed? F.B.I.Agents Star and Hunt are in the Jackets off, shoulder holsters on.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I personally picked this suite. Only one exit. from the shower wearing a huge hotel them.

MARSHAL CORD	That's right.
MASON	well if it excites-you ...
MARSHAL CORD	Put the goddamn clothes on.

MASON	Jade - remember what I said.
GOODSPEED	No cuffs until we get to the cars,
MASON	You surprise me, Goodspeed. Now I'm going to surprise myself: thank-you, you could have handled that differently.
GOODSPEED	You almost got me killed. Twice.

GOODSPEED	It hurts.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You cocksucker you dislocated my shoulder and cost the city of San Francisco ten million dollars. You try to escape

COMMANDER ANDERSON	That's not what you said three minutes ago.
MASON	It's not?
COMMANDER ANDERSON	Excuse me. Womack.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play "twenty questions."
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	He knows every inch of those tunnels, Commander.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	Then he's keeping it to himself. He's fucking with me and I don't have the time.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	What if he went with you?
COMMANDER ANDERSON	Out of the question. He'll endanger the mission - he'll endanger my men. He's a security risk. Who says he won't bolt as
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	I'll handle that. Chaney.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	You're not cooperating, John. Maybe this will help. I'm sure you're curious about what's happening on Alcatraz. Twelve United States Marines - a terrorist rogue force - have Yes, John, including your daughter.
MASON	You son-of-fucking-Satan.

GOODSPEED	Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. Here. The prison morgue. It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense. V.X. gas begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?
GOODSPEED	No sir, but I've studied them ....
COMMANDER ANDERSON	That's great, Goodspeed. You're in the Bureau, so you've had weapons training.
GOODSPEED	A little, sir.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	So you've never been in a combat situation.
GOODSPEED	No sir. Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?
COMMANDER ANDERSON	Won't be necessary.
GOODSPEED	Sir, these are very complicated devices...
COMMANDER ANDERSON	I know they are, Goodspeed. That's why you're going with us.
GOODSPEED	Sir?
COMMANDER ANDERSON	Get him some gear.

HUMMEL	Don't tell me your problems, tell me your solutions.
GENERAL KRAMER	We've spoken to the President. He's not too happy about this.
HUMMEL	Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance ...
HAYDEN SINCLAIR	The only thing the President will give you is a fair trial after you're caught, General.
HUMMEL	That you, Sinclair? What exactly do you do at the White House? Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine?
HAYDEN SINCLAIR	Now you give me some coddamn respect, General ....
HUMMEL	You want respect, you child, you coffee server? Let's talk about Dave Ridgeway.
GENERAL KRAMER	Who's Dave Ridgeway, Frank?

HUMMEL	Tell 'em to stay out there.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us to a room with no exit. Skipper, blow it or burn it?

MASON	Wait for me to unlock the door.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	You do not look like Jesus Christ, Mr. Mason, so I'm having a hard time how you're going to accomplish that.
MASON	Under there.
COMMANDER ANDERSON	You are shitting me. You catch one of those steam bursts and you're a corpse.
MASON	True. I memorized their timing.

GOODSPEED	We're never gettin off this island.
GOODSPEED	.... god Jesus we're gonna die
SANCHEZ	You told me I am on a "need to know" basis. Well goddamn it, I need to know. Who the fuck is John Mason. Start talking, Director, or 1962. J. Edgar Hoover is head of the F.B.I., some say the country. It's no secret the esteemed Mr. Hoover kept himself.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	The British sent over their best operative, John Mason, to steal it.
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	Our agents caught MASON at the Canadian border but with no microfilm. It's never been found.
SANCHEZ	What about the daughter? why didn't Hoover use her as leverage?
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	He died in 1972. She wasn't born yet Today it's a different Bureau and no one wants to touch this.
SANCHEZ	My god, you're not saying ...
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	has been incarcerated without trial on American soil since 1962. He knows our most intimate secrets of the last half century. The alien landing at Roswell, the truth about
F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK	John MASON was an S.A.S. trained killer, one of MI-6's best operatives ever - John MASON was one of the most dangerous men on earth. his -9 mil pistol in self-defense.

GOODSPEED	It's me sir.
SANCHEZ	What is happening? Where's Mason?
GOODSPEED	He says he's leaving the island sir.
SANCHEZ	Don't let him do that.
GOODSPEED	He's got a gun, sir.
SANCHEZ	What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL? Get him back!
HUMMEL	I never wanted this. Jesus christ.
BAXTER	We knew it might happen, Frank.
CAPTAIN DARROW	Maybe now they'll pay up.

GOODSPEED	I don't get it. You're going to help me?
MASON	No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons. What the fuck do you think?
GOODSPEED	You don't have to get all bent out of shape.
MASON	What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel I was going through
GOODSPEED	All right, all right. Don't call me idiot, okay?
	And there.
MASON	Cottonmouth snakes. They breath through their skin. Oil clogs
MASON	sprays the motor oil across the pool. The snakes scatter. The pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK. MASON wades in. Goodspeed follows.

HAYDEN SINCLAIR	The President arrives in three hours. His directive is to string Hummel along until the airstrike is operational.

GOODSPEED	Good point. Okay here, take 'em. What are you doing?
MASON	Now they only have three rockets left.
GOODSPEED	What about Mr. Henderson?
MASON	Hummel's a soldier, not a murderer.
GOODSPEED	Wait.
MASON	Find the rockets. If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
GOODSPEED	I... I don't know if I can do this.
MASON	There's only one way to find out. I'll try to give you time. And Goodspeed.... Don't be an idiot. Put that on.
GOODSPEED	Well thank-you, thank-you very much.
CAPTAIN DARROW	Gotta be kidding me. They send an old man.
HUMMEL	I thought I'd been in the service a long time. Name and rank, sailor.
MASON	John Paul Mason. Royal Navy. Commander.
HUMMEL	You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.
MASON	I feel strangely at home.
HUMMEL	How's that?
MASON	You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
HUMMEL	Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility, Commander Mason?
MASON	Quite unique.
HUMMEL	How's that?
MASON	I was a guest here. Suddenly a voice:
GOODSPEED	Freeze. Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly. PVT. MCCOY appears. Looking down, sees GOODSPEED and Cox. He cinches his REPELLING CLIP to the steel
HUMMEL	Well you're some kind of joker, Mason. Maybe you're a lunatic. Are you of sound mind, Mason?
MASON	I'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people. You are. demeanor changes. Hard now. Tight.
HUMMEL	Give me the guidance chips.
MASON	I threw them in the bay.
HUMMEL	That was stupid of you.
MASON	Would you have shot him7
HUMMEL	You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand necessity.
MASON	Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins."
HUMMEL	"Where there is no law, there is no transgression." The Bible. Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.
MASON	Article 7, American Constitution? "Treason against the United States shall consist of... 11
HUMMEL	The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander. Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and stupidity. I see little difference in my motivation.
