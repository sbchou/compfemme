HOWARD	But while she lives, majesty, she is a beacon that draws our enemies' eyes and hopes.
ELIZABETH	While she lives?
HATTON	She is the poison at the heart of England. The poison must be cut out.

ELIZABETH (V.O.)	How many Catholics are there in England, sir?
HOWARD (V.O.)	Immense numbers, majesty!
HATTON (V.O.)	We believe half the nation clings to the old superstitions. ELIZABETH What would you have me do? `Cut out' half the people of England? HOWARD We must act, majesty.

WALSINGHAM	I confine myself to the possible. BESS An honest man. With friendly eyes.

COURT LADY	So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship? You shoot holes in its sides, I suppose.
RALEIGH	No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no value. The object is to capture and command.
COURT LADY	And how do you do that?

BESS	It seems you've presumed after all.
RALEIGH	It seems you're determined to think the worst of me.
BESS	Tell me what it is you really want.
RALEIGH	What every man wants. Money. Fame. Love.
BESS	In that order?
RALEIGH	Each leads to the next. The money will buy and equip ships for a return voyage to the New World. The success of my infant colony there will make me famous. The fame will bring me love.
BESS	It seems rather a long way round.
RALEIGH	There are benefits along the way. It is something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city.

RALEIGH	May I ask a question in return?
BESS	Of course.

BESS	Why should I tell you that, sir?
RALEIGH	I've little enough to offer, I know. But whatever I have to give - ask, and it's yours.
BESS	My advice to you is, say what you mean to say as plainly as possible. All men flatter the Queen in the hope of advancement. Pay her the compliment of truth.

ELIZABETH	There are duller professions. And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms?

Walsingham is talking to Elizabeth about matters of state.
RALEIGH (V.O.)	You live with fear, in the grip of fear - fear of storms, fear of sickness on board, fear of the immensity. What if you never escape? How can you escape? There's nowhere to go.

RALEIGH	You speak like a true explorer.
ELIZABETH	I like you, Mr Raleigh.
RALEIGH	And I like you.
ELIZABETH	You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him.
ALEIGH	I have heard that.
ELIZABETH	And what have you to say about it? R ALEIGH Reward my mission, majesty, not me.
ELIZABETH	Is the mission not the man? RALEIGH Leave me free to like you in return. That can be my reward.

ELIZABETH	Alright, then. I will.
ELIZABETH	See! You lie! You don't want me on your ship at all. You're a liar! Elizabeth now takes in Bess.
ELIZABETH	Would you like to go to sea, Bess?

BESS	I hope you believe that I like you for yourself, my lady. ELIZABETH Is anybody ever liked just for themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you're pretty. And because you have the ear of the Queen. May 1 Blue Draft - p. 50
