WERNER (V.O.)	On his 35th birthday, I decided to tell Julius Benedict the truth about himself...
WERNER (V.O.)	It wasn't that he was the product of a scientific experiment.
WERNER (V.O.)	An experiment designed to produce a physically, mentally and spiritually superior human being. I explained that to him when he was two years old. And it wasn't the complexity of Julius's parentage. He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn't have just one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men. * Nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother... Julius had long lived with the tragic news that she died giving birth to him. What Julius didn't know, until this very moment, was that, about a minute after he was born... Another nurse emerges from the delivery room, holding up
WERNER (V.O.)	His mother gave birth to another baby...
The angry baby. Fuming.	PULL BACK to reveal: The two of them are in the same crib. The leg of the angry baby. It suddenly lashes out, The angry baby. All smiles now. HOLD ON the two babies in their crib as the following ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER DANNY DE VITO TWINS
JULIUS	I have a brother?!!! A greenhouse on the island. Werner, now 70, is bent and old. Julius, in peasant garb
WERNER	He was sent to an orphanage in Los Angeles. At the same time I brought you here to the island. Julius isn't listening. His eyes shine.
JULIUS	I have a twin brother?!! What's his name?
WERNER	Vincent. JULIUS Vincent -- Every time I loved something I called it Vincent -- I called my first computer Vincent! I have to find him! Werner. The ocean spread out below them is vast and WERNER You've been here since you were a baby -- you know nothing of America -- JULIUS I know it is the cradle of democracy and the land of the free; besides, I speak twelve languages -- I'm sure I can get a job.
WERNER	They're a simple people; rather primitive, not like us.
JULIUS	My brother will look after me. Werner hands over a photograph: it's a picture of a JULIUS It's your only copy -- WERNER -- My need for it is only sentimental -- yours may be practical -- Julius slips the photo into his suitcase. JULIUS Thank you -- I'll miss you.
WERNER	I'll miss you.
CONTINUED: (A1) A14	OLD WOMAN * It's sixty miles to the airport, * Julius; be careful. * Julius then bows to the Oriental, who bows back.
JULIUS	It was an honor to study under you, Master. Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in
ORIENTAL	Ahhh, always on guard. You have learned well, Julius-san. Julius gives a last hug to Werner.
JULIUS	I was just thinking, maybe my brother Vincent is married.
WERNER	And...?
JULIUS	Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me. That often happens with twins, you know. WERNER Julius -- please -- don't get your hopes up. Your brother doesn't even know you exist. JULIUS Of course he does. I've always known there was something missing in my life! And deep down, I'm sure Vincent feels the same way! He's probably just like meeeee!
VINCE	You sleep well, honey? Mmmm... like a baby.
VINCE	Me, too. I love this new mattress. It's soft but it's hard at the same time. And I love this new clock. VINCE You've done a great job on this room, Carla. CARLA You really think so? Even the curtains?
VINCE	The curtains are the key to the whole thing. They're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains.
CARLA	You were great last night, Vince.
VINCE	Naaaw... I think we're going to be very happy here. Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a Honey! I'm home!
VINCE	What's he doing back so early?
MAN (O.S.)	Carla? You gonna cook me some breakfast or what?
CARLA	Be right down, sweetheart! Vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror,
CARLA	Hurry up! I gotta make breakfast!
VINCE	You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet. -- and with that, he leaps into space!
VINCE	'Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day'... Now he does something surprising -- not starting to drive,
VINCE	... 'everything's going my way'...
VINCE	Carla, what a joy to look at you. Is my partner and best friend, Al home from work yet? I am the bringer of good tidings.
VINCE	Stop with that horrible song, you know how I hate birthdays; they're worse than Christmas. Al presents him with the gift.
VINCE	For me?
AL	Carla and I figured, since you were always admiring mine, what the hell...
VINCE	A lighter, just like yours. I don't know what to say, Al. I'm all choked up. CARLA Hello -- the Greco residence... sure. Who may I say is calling... Mr. Burt Klane? Vince, it's for you -- VINCE Good morning, Mr. Klane. I hope you're having a wonderful -- Yes -- no problem -- I have it. Yes. Today. Of course. 'Bye. Vince hangs up. What are you doing talking to a loanshark?
VINCE	That's part of my good news -- You know that money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted. Well, * I put the money in the stock * market. I got this incredible * tip. * CARLA Oh no. *
VINCE	I can't lose. Ever hear of P.V.T. * Industries? Probably not -- * Secret takeover bid -- AL You put the money on a stock? *
VINCE	A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane * Brothers. CARLA You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market? VINCE On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead. I'm * going to make a fortune -- turn on the T.V. ... that Wall Street's suffering its worst single-day's losses since October '87. Hardest hit * were Federated Broadcasting, down $18, Waverton Data, down $24 and P.V.T. Industries, down $32. Analysts speculate that even blue chip stocks will not remain immune to... CLOSEUP ON the extremely worried face of Vince as he
AL	You are having one shitty birthday, Vince. VINCE I'm wiped out. I got to get some money -- fast. * AL Well... '88 B.M.W. came in for long term last night...
CARLA	Don't you think you're doing this too often?
VINCE	I'm a desperate man. *
AL	Level three. Stall 25. Vincent approaches the BMW and pretends to be searching
VINCE	This is only four thousand --
OWNER	We're in a recession -- Everything's tough -- you want to try someone else -- no hard feelings. VINCE Forget it.
OWNER	You okay, Vince? You seem a little worried.
VINCE	Me? I laugh myself to sleep every night, and I never sleep alone. I'm doing great! The Owner smiles and turns. Vince continues counting the 'Put on your red dress, baby 'Cause we're going out tonight...' A few passengers turn and look back at --
JULIUS	seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo JULIUS 'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.' STEWARDESS I knew you were trouble the second I laid eyes on you. Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized.
JULIUS	Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it. * She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while
STEWARDESS	The captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because we're expecting a little turbulence.
JULIUS	Thank you, Betty Lou. STEWARDESS I bet you're a football player.
JULIUS	Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher.
STEWARDESS	Right. And I'm a brain surgeon.
HIJACKER (MAN)	Nobody moves, or else we're gonna have a serious draft in here. Get the captain. I want to discuss our final destination.
JULIUS	turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's JULIUS Excuse me, ma'am. -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air, retrieving the hardcover Bible from the floor and -- His mischief shall return upon his own hand, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head -- Psalm 7:16. In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass-
BARTENDER	It's him. He's back.
VINCE	Marnie! How are you? Is your * sister around? * Marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into You total Linda's car. You pawn * her stereo. You declare us as * dependents on your tax return!? VINCE What an amazing memory -- Vince! I knew you'd come back! dependent, and legally blind when it comes to Vincent.
VINCE	I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.
LINDA	Like what?
MARNIE	Linda! LINDA I'm not going to give him any money. Just take care of my station for a minute.
VINCE	I didn't come here for a loan, sweetheart. I came to say goodbye. It's not safe for me here. People are trying to kill me. Vince starts to rise but Linda pulls him back down.
LINDA	What did you do, Vince?
VINCE	I got involved in the stock market. LINDA I promised Marnie I wouldn't give you money. Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her
LINDA	Don't look at me like that... Don't do that with your eyes... I shouldn't even be here with you.
VINCE	You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you... Linda. I only have eyes for you. LINDA That is so beautiful. How do you make up that stuff? You're such a poet. VINCE You inspire me. VINCE It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out. Burt Klane strolls to the middle of the room, then suddenly BURT KLANE Where's the little shit?
LINDA	You gotta be more specific, considering our clientele.
BURT KLANE	Benedict.
LINDA	He wouldn't show his face around here. Right, Marnie? She looks down at -- VINCE
MARNIE	Who, Vincent? * -- That weasel, that creep -- that oily little slug -- that two-bit, two-timing, waste of space -- that pathetic, low-life pocket Romeo.
BURT KLANE	Okay -- enough. BOB KLANE Look what I found crawling around out back. BURT KLANE This is only four thousand --
VINCE	The rest is invested. We're gonna make a fortune. BOB KLANE Shut up. Linda comes over -- Very nervous, she looks around, then
LINDA	I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him.
BURT KLANE	There you go -- -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow. *
VINCE	Twenty -- ? But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again.
BURT KLANE	That's just the interest. The * twenty's the principal. * VINCE That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me -- LINDA It's your birthday? Why didn't you tell me?
VINCE	I can't take the kindness. It gives me the shakes. LINDA You'll tremble plenty before we're through, Vince Benedict. They kiss. "flowers" and street food and there's a porno house * druggies and guys slumped unconscious in the gutter and -- There's Julius, case in hand, staring around, taking it
CLOSEUP ON JULIUS	And you can see it on his face: He loves it.
JULIUS	... How wonderful... But Julius is pretty noticable no matter where he goes. Julius, staring at it, shaking his head. JULIUS What an amazing country.
BIKER #1	ROARING up beside Julius, smiling ingratiatingly.
BIKER #1	Got a light, pal?
JULIUS	Sorry, but I don't smoke... pal? BIKER #1 Looking for something for your girl friend?
JULIUS	I... don't have a girl friend. Do women really wear these things? BIKER #1 If you're lucky. You from out of town? *
JULIUS	Yes, a small island in the South * Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji... Biker #2, bounds along, and when he reaches Julius he Not an original plan, certainly, but one that over and over again, always works --
CASE HANDLE	Julius's hand holds fast to it. Then -- As his mouth drops open as we --
JULIUS	just sort of standing there, no big deal, not much effort ending its trip as it collides with a storefront and
CYCLIST #1	stunned, going to his unconscious partner. BIKER #1 What the hell did you do? Julius calmly kneels beside the still form. He puts
JULIUS	I did nothing, the pavement was his enemy.
JULIUS	I would say -- a concussion -- a mild shoulder separation, and ribs to seven are cracked. Get him to a hospital. JULIUS And in the future, you should both consider wearing helmets. A sweet smile. thru VINCE Fifty-three dollars? You gotta * be kidding.
COP	Your vehicle's in a handicapped zone. Vince immediately hunches his shoulder and affects a
VINCE	So? Do I look normal to you?
COP	You don't have a 'handicapped' sticker on your windshield. Driver's license, please.
COP	You've got over 200 outstanding parking tickets, Mr. Benedict. And you just had your birthday? Well, your driver's license just expired -- Happy birthday. *
JULIUS (V.O.)	So, this is where my brother grew up. I'm glad he had so many friends to play with. *
JULIUS	And that's where he must have slept.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	How did you know?
JULIUS	It's the one I would have chosen. It's next to the fire extinguisher. In case of a fire, I could have given the alarm, and saved the other orphans.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	We've only had one fire at St. Charlotte's. Vince Benedict started it, we like to think by accident.
JULIUS	Tell me about him. Was he a good athlete? Did he like chess and poetry?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I'm certain that God had a purpose when he created Vincent Benedict, but it had nothing to do with chess or poetry. MOTHER SUPERIOR That's odd... the contents of his file are missing. Julius picks up the photo -- a 13-year-old boy leering up
JULIUS	This is him? He looks happy -- *
MOTHER SUPERIOR	He should -- that's Sister Maria, * his biology teacher.
JULIUS	I always liked biology.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	So did Vincent. He disgraced Sister Maria, who had to leave the order. Then he stole all the money from our library fund and ran away.
JULIUS	But I have to find him. Where do you think he might be?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Jail. A man of his character could only be in jail. You're full of goodness, Julius -- I pray that you never find him. SEVEN FOOTER What're you lookin' at? VINCE At you, you jerk. The Seven Footer rises angrily to his full size. Vince
VINCE	Tyrone Davis, averaged 23 points, eleven rebounds and four blocks a game his senior year. First round pick of the L.A. Clippers and now look at him. SEVEN FOOTER Who're you? VINCE World International Athletics * Representation. Vincent Benedict -- President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living --
GUARD	Benedict! Visitor. VINCE Call me when you get out, they're always looking for centers in Italy... -- and as a look of pleasure comes across his face --
GUARD	leading an attractive, powerful inmate into the room.
JULIUS	trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner -- then past him.
Julius makes a smile.	Vince just stares. JULIUS Excuse me, but I'm looking for Vincent Benedict. GUARD You got 'im. Julius turns, looks at Vince, and as he walks back to his wonder of it all. JULIUS emotions are in Vincent... dearest Vincent... I have rowed halfway across the world -- no, wrong, I only rowed one day but I came halfway across * the world -- I know you don't know who I am, but believe me when I say I have been waiting for this * moment all my life... It's hard to tell what Vince is feeling but clearly the VINCE You gotta talk into the phone, * asshole. Julius is confused, momentarily.
JULIUS	Vincent...
VINCE	listening, somewhat amazed. Who is this loony?
JULIUS (V.O.)	... Dearest Vincent... Vince glances quickly around to see that no one is
JULIUS (V.O.)	I know you don't know who I am, but -- I came halfway across the world --
VINCE	-- Whoa. I still got another six hours to pay the money back. You * tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a man when he's already in the slammer is beneath even them -- JULIUS -- I don't know any Klane brothers. I'm your brother, Julius. VINCE Huh? Again?
JULIUS	I don't know any Klane Brothers.
VINCE	Yeah. Go on -- I got that part.
JULIUS	My name is Julius -- I'm your twin brother.
VINCE	Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror. JULIUS We're not identical twins.
VINCE	I wouldn't be too sure. JULIUS You don't believe a word I've said, do you? VINCE -- That's right. I don't believe a word you said. *
JULIUS	Vincent, I don't lie. I am your brother. Let me help you get out * of here. VINCE Oh... you want to help me get outta here? JULIUS Yes. VINCE Well, money talks, bullshit walks. JULIUS How can bullshit walk? Is that slang?
VINCE	I'm in fast company here -- Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma... VINCE Just don't ask me to bend over -- VINCE Listen, 'twinny,' I hope you didn't blow your wad on those tickets, 'cause it's gonna cost a bunch more to release my car.
JULIUS	I have some more money -- VINCE You do?
JULIUS	I am happy to help you, Vincent. You're my brother. I love you.
VINCE	Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right? JULIUS Tossing cookies, that is more slang?
VINCE	Just gimme your wallet, okay? As Julius sweetly hands it over --
JULIUS	I know what you're thinking?
VINCE	No, you don't.
JULIUS	You're thinking that this whole twin business is what you call 'bullshit.' This is exactly what Vince has been thinking.
VINCE	Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car --
JULIUS	You can take some more money -- VINCE I can? JULIUS Sure...
VINCE	We're brothers -- right? Julius tries to drape an arm around Vince's shoulder.
VINCE	They arrest you, they put you * behind bars, they fine you and * then they hide your car. *
JULIUS	That's -- -- your car, isn't it?
VINCE'S MUSTANG	Which is what Julius is pointing at.
VINCE	Yeah -- How'd you know that was my car.
JULIUS	We're twins! Vince unlocks his side, gets in. Julius, smiling and
JULIUS	I'm so excited -- we'll go to museums together, discuss philosophy together, read books together -- play chess together -- VINCE -- Get lost together -- And on that, he GUNS his CAR the hell away, leaving
JULIUS	Deserted, alone in the sea of cars. AL Hey, the new Sedan DeVille... Very nice. The driver, GARFIELD, just nods, holds out his hand for
AL	You guys must be going to Hawaii, huh? Catch that good surf.
GARFIELD	Something like that. The two men just stare straight ahead, uninterested in
AL	There's plenty of space on level four. The Cadillac accelerates up the ramp.

VINCE	What're you doing with my desk?
MOVER	Taking back the furniture -- you're six months behind.
MISS BUSBY	I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict -- VINCE It was time to redecorate anyway. The PHONE RINGS -- Miss Busby drops to her knees beside MISS BUSBY Vincent Benedict, Incorporated -- Sports agent, artist's representative -- import/export -- automobile sales, rentals, and leasing -- wholesale patio furniture -- How may I help you? Oh, hi. It's Al. As she hands him the phone.
VINCE	Miss Busby -- Stacy -- this is a transition period for the corporation -- Why don't you take a few days off.
MISS BUSBY	... Aah -- all right. Whatever you say, Mr. Benedict... Oh, before I forget... Happy birthday... She hands him a gift-wrapped present which he opens.
VINCE	'Aqua-Velva' -- you shouldn't have -- She takes her purse, smiles, goes. When he's alone, into phone:
VINCE	I hope you got some good news, * Al -- * AL Brand new Caddy on level four.
VINCE	Great, I'll be right over. Vince drops to his knees in order to replace the phone PULL BACK to reveal MORRIS KLANE, the biggest of them all,
MORRIS KLANE	Time's up, Vincent -- Got the money? He bends over, picks Vince up by the neck like a toy doll,
VINCE	In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath. He finally
VINCE	Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'.
MORRIS KLANE	He grabs Vince again.
MORRIS KLANE	You gotta understand something, Benedict -- I like my work. He pulls Vince groggily up and this time he's going for
JULIUS	These are most unfriendly acts you are committing.
MORRIS KLANE	What? JULIUS I don't know what the problem is, but I'm sure it can be solved without resorting to violence. MORRIS KLANE Okay, okay. JULIUS Good. * Julius lets go of Klane, who gets to his feet, turns
JULIUS	You moved too soon. Klane spins and aims a karate kick at Julius's head. JULIUS An important rule in a crisis * situation -- negotiate first, attack last. You never negotiated. You don't know what kind of enemy I am.
MORRIS KLANE	Who are you?
JULIUS	Vincent's brother.
VINCE	We're twins.
MORRIS KLANE	You're firewood.
JULIUS	You have no respect for logic -- *
JULIUS	-- And I have no respect for those with no respect for logic. You're a very stupid person.
VINCE	Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both hands and
JULIUS	As he heaves Klane across the corridor into the open VINCE
VINCE	Tell your brother 'He messes with me, he messes with my whole family!'
VINCE	I like it when you hit people!
JULIUS	I hate violence. VINCE But you're so good at it. We ought to go into business together. You could be a boxer and I'll be your manager. JULIUS I don't think I could fight for money.
VINCE	No problem. You do the fighting, I'll keep all the money.
JULIUS	I'm worried about you, Vincent. They reach Vince's Mustang and get in.
JULIUS	How much money do you owe? Don't lie -- we're twins, I can feel your pain.
VINCE	Why do you keep saying that? We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days -- JULIUS Twenty thousand? VINCE Due this morning. Suddenly Vince bangs his forehead with the palm of his
VINCE	I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport for me. JULIUS I'd love to. Julius reaches into the glove compartment, takes out the VINCE What are you doing with that finger? JULIUS Learning to drive. Vince isn't sure what's going on at this point. Now Vince and Julius's heads are both in motion now --
JULIUS	What's the matter?
VINCE	That dopey Sam -- He did it again. Forgot to leave the keys... A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed...
JULIUS	Handicapped children? VINCE This car was supposed to be auctioned off at their charity drive tomorrow. Oh, well, let's go eat.
JULIUS	Maybe we should try to open it ourselves... Vince raises his eyebrows in mock surprise.
VINCE	You think we should do a thing like that?
JULIUS	Of course -- it's for the children... CLOSEUP - SLIM JIM Vince inserts it into the Cadillac's driver's-side * VINCE I saw a guy from the auto club do this once... The door locks suddenly pop up in unison. VINCE Whaddya know? Beginner's luck!
VINCE	As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside -- -- Vince frantically scrambles around, lying on the car Second, the SIREN STOPS. Vince looks out the car window. When the back end is raised to an angle greater than 45 degrees, a mercury switch activates the automatic cutoff system. The alarm's computer thinks the car is being towed away and shuts off.
VINCE	No shit... It's beginning to dawn on Vince that there may be more to A pause. Now the Mustang comes along, Julius at the wheel. He JULIUS Vincent Benedict's car. Vincent! Where are you? Ya see that little dot in your rearview mirror? That's me.
JULIUS	Hi, Vincent. There's a supermarket up ahead. Take your foot off the gas and very -- very -- very gently put it on the brake. JULIUS The brake -- right. Vince's car pulls in a moment later. He gets out, gazes
JULIUS	The brakes worked just fine! VINCE Lemme tell you something about America, Julius -- nobody likes a smart-ass.
LINDA AND MARNIE	are pushing a cart down one of the other aisles. Linda
LINDA	Angel's food or devil's food? MARNIE The answer's obvious.
LINDA	There's only one Vince Benedict. He's a force of nature. MARNIE And that 'poetry' he pretends to write. They're old song lyrics, Linda. Linda stops pushing the cart and looks at her.
LINDA	I know that -- Geez, you don't think I know that -- ? It's so cute, the way he thinks he's tricking me. Anyway, what's wrong about other people's songs? Some guys tell you dirty jokes. It just proves that Vince has a romantic soul. MAGAZINE RACK Adjacent to the express checkout lane where Linda and Excuse me. She reaches past Julius to take a copy of Cosmopolitan.
MARNIE	She's not bad...
JULIUS	I'm sorry. I had no idea these magazines had things like that... inside them. Julius tries to stuff the centerfold back into the maga- MARNIE You didn't? Where've you been? A desert island? JULIUS As a matter of fact, a small tropical island, in the South Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji. I only got here yesterday, but already * I've found my wonderful brother. * MARNIE Your brother? That's right... They all turn and look at Vince, who's pulled his cart
JULIUS	My twin brother, Vincent. Linda and Marnie, stunned, look from Vince to Julius.
VINCE	God you look beautiful in this light. Vince... ? I didn't know you had a brother.
JULIUS	You all know each other?
VINCE	Julius, meet Linda and... Her charming sister, Marnie.
JULIUS	Sisters? MARNIE Twins?
OUTSIDE THE SUPERMARKET B68	
VINCE	Goodbye girls, see you soon. JULIUS Goodbye girls, see you soon. And he guns off too -- only in his excitement he's gone
JULIUS	I've only been drivng for an hour. Now he follows Vince. MARNIE Why do I think I'm going to see him again? Like maybe tomorrow.
JULIUS	Linda is your girl friend, isn't she?
VINCE	Yeah. Kind of. JULIUS Is Marnie your girl friend, too? VINCE Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to like you.
JULIUS	She hardly knows me. A beat.
VINCE	That's the best way -- women love men who are mysterious and devious. It keeps them on their toes -- makes them excited you know what I mean?
JULIUS	No.
VINCE	You do like women, don't you? JULIUS Very much, they're... strange and sensitive and they have compassion. I have the highest respect for women.
VINCE	Now correct me if I'm wrong. You're a virgin, aren't you?
JULIUS	That's private. Vince clocks Julius's reaction as he removes an eviction
VINCE	He's a 230-pound virgin. * VINCE Alright! Alright! I got your food. Yes! 'Liver and Cheese,' 'Chicken Giblets,' all your favorites, Julius.
JULIUS	You named your cat, Julius? VINCE The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese. I know you're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the mainland we just nuke it!
VINCE	Dinner is served! They both freeze and stare at each other for a long beat. It's definitely empty.
WEBSTER	He looks at the Cadillac key. Clearly, he is not happy at
VINCE	So, let me get this right. One of * our fathers was a famous football player, another one was a physicist at M.I.T. --
JULIUS	He won the Nobel Prize.
VINCE	Naturally... so all of our dads were these big shots and Mom was, like, Superwoman, but she didn't survive our delivery. I got sent to an orphanage while you were brought up in a tropical paradise by this scientist you do research for, but who doesn't actually pay you because you don't need money. Did I leave anything out? Julius ignores Vince's cynicism.
JULIUS	I think it's important we try to find our fathers.
VINCE	You mean, all those geniuses who contributed to the... ... Sperm milkshake? * JULIUS Why are you being so immature about this? * Vince throws down his napkin. VINCE Do you know how many times I've heard stories like this? It's every orphan's fantasy: 'My real Mom and Dad were rich and beautiful, but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched with another baby... But one day there's going to be a knock at the door and there they'll be with open arms, crying... "My darling! My treasure! We didn't know! How can we make it up to you?"' I'm telling you this for your own good, Julius. It's a crock. Vince goes over to a trunk, rummages in it, comes up with VINCE I liberated this from my file at the orphanage. Read it and weep. Julius takes the paper and reads aloud.
JULIUS	Dear Sister Anderson, your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied. According to our files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles. Vincent's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid. Vince snatches the paper back. Julius stares at him, VINCE That's right, Julius, she abandoned me.
JULIUS	This letter was written thirty * years ago. We were five years old * -- Our mother... didn't die when we were born... You've known all this time where she was and you never contacted her?
VINCE	I don't know about your momma, Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she's still alive, I hope she's in a lot of pain. She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again --
JULIUS	Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for all these years, maybe they lied to her, too. We must find her, we must check this address. * He can't hide the excitement.
VINCE	Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this. You go hunt down * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem * to deal with.
VINCE	What! We haven't forgotten about you, Benedict -- You better have our money tomorrow morning. Or else. VINCE Or else what? Suddenly, Vince's living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst JULIUS Everyone seems so angry in America.
GARFIELD	The tests on the lower temperature gaskets look great.
LARSON	Looks like an easy weekend. SECRETARY Mr. Garfield, there's a... *
GARFIELD	Not now.
GARFIELD	Who are you?
WEBSTER	I'm Webster, it's okay.
GARFIELD	on the sound of the name. He looks at Larson. A beat. *
LARSON	Christ, man, you were never * supposed to come here.
GARFIELD	The deal was we were never supposed to meet. You're supposed to be...
WEBSTER	Driving that Cadillac to Texas? Got my driving gloves, got my driving glasses, got my hat... but no car. The car was there! The merchandise was in the trunk! Your instructions were on the cassette! He wants more money. That's what this is about. WEBSTER Let me explain something to you. I have a reputation to uphold. People put their trust in me because they know I always deliver the goods and I always come back with the money. This whole thing is making me look very bad... professionally.
GARFIELD	This is bullshit! The car was there. LARSEN That's right. The parking attendant thought we were off for Hawaii.
WEBSTER	The parking attendant? GARFIELD He liked the car. We'd put on those damn loud shirts so we'd look like tourists -- LARSEN He asked us if we were going surfing. He was a jerk.
WEBSTER	You know, I just realized that in * twenty years of service no other * client has ever seen my face. GARFIELD I don't think that's a problem. Webster pulls out a silencer-equipped pistol and puts WEBSTER Guess you're right. *
OMITTED 78	Secretary.
WEBSTER	Thanks for everything, guys. I'll see what I can do about those Laker tickets. Yeah, I'll tell her. WEBSTER They want you to hold their calls. They're going to be working late.
GRANGER	Yes? JULIUS I'm terribly sorry to disturb your party and I realize this might sound strange, but I'm looking for someone who lived here a long time ago... Mary Anne Benedict. Granger reacts; he's speechless. Julius hands him the
JULIUS	She was my mother. Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius. GRANGER You're Mary Anne's son?
GIRL	Isn't that you, Grandpa?
GRANGER	Why don't you go help your grandma with lunch, honey?
GRANGER	They told your mother that you died at birth... Julius studies them admiringly while Granger looks at the
GRANGER	I guess you could say I'm your father...
JULIUS	One of my fathers -- GRANGER 'Mary Anne Benedict'... I haven't said her name aloud for over 30 years. She was the love of my life. The times I've wondered what would have happened if I'd married her...
JULIUS	Why didn't you?
GRANGER	She turned me down. Said she was afraid to have children. She took it real hard when they told her you died. She even stopped painting. Did you know she painted? JULIUS Until yesterday I didn't even know she might still be alive... Who told her we died?
GRANGER	'We'?
JULIUS	I have a twin brother, Vincent. GRANGER There's two of you? She never * knew that, either.
GRANGER	Mitchell Traven. He supervised the experiment for the government. He's the one responsible for all of this. He still runs the genetics lab at Los Alamos, New Mexico.
JULIUS	I'll go see him. GRANGER Watch out for him -- he's kind of a dickhead, if you know what I mean. No, I don't -- but I'm learning. Mr. Webster, I hope you're happy with the vehicle we chose for your little journey. When you get to Houston, phone 713/555-0342 and * ask for Beetroot McKinley. He will arrange to trade you a briefcase for the merchandise in the trunk. Vince stops the car dead, the Body Shop Owner comes up
BODY SHOP OWNER	New Caddy? Let's check it out. The trunk is filled with a sleeping bag that might contain BODY SHOP OWNER The car's okay -- I'll give you three grand.
VINCE	Sorry -- the car's been promised for a kid's charity. BODY SHOP OWNER Okay, four grand. As Vince starts to drive away: BODY SHOP OWNER Okay -- Six thousand -- that's as high as I'm going... thru
VOICE (V.O.)	Beetroot McKinley talkin'. Who's cloggin' up the line? VINCE -- Uh... Webster -- calling from California. I happen to have some merchandise you might want --
McKINLEY *	Well, bring it to me, son, and let me enrich you. It's the amount of enrichment I want to talk about. McKINLEY Don't try and renegotiate with Old Beetroot, son -- VINCE Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die. I'm not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing for sure I got twenty for my cut.
Beetroot. Exploding.	McKINLEY Listen, you little shit-for-brains peckerwood, you're out of your goddam crazy diseased greedy mind! We can see the briefcase now by the way -- it's open and
VINCE	I guess twenty seems a little high to you. I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal -- VINCE -- But --
McKINLEY	Don't 'but' me, the deal is five -- I can do better than five here. McKINLEY If you can do better than five million dollars, take it! * VINCE F-five million dollars... He writes down the proper amount now: $5,000,000. Then
VINCE	Beetroot? What?
VINCE	I'll see you in Houston -- after all, fair is fair. I'll just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer... Vince hangs up, jumps up and screams with joy. He puts VINCE Five million dollars!
WEBSTER *	Your boss at the lot told me you * were on duty when the Cadillac * clocked in. Now what's his name? * AL Okay... His name is Vince Benedict.
WEBSTER	That's certainly a beginning.
CARLA	I'm really disappointed in you -- ratting on your best friend. WEBSTER My best friend who's been screwing my wife for three years. CARLA You knew?
AL	All three years.
CARLA	And you never told me until there was a stranger listening? Shit, what about my reputation?
WEBSTER	Where can I find Mister Benedict?
AL	I'm not saying.
WEBSTER	Let me get this right -- You're protecting the weasel who's been * screwing your wife for the past three years. AL He's my friend.
WEBSTER	Well, I guess I'll have to beat it out of you --
CARLA	Stop -- I'll tell -- He lives at 1622 Westridge Place -- He's got an office at the corner of Highland and Hollywood.
AL	Thanks for saving me.
CARLA	I always loved you, Al. It's just I couldn't resist Vince. It's those eyes -- he does this thing with his eyes...
AL	I love you too, Carla.
WEBSTER	door, shaking his No one's gonna believe this one. VINCE 'Going back to Houston, Houston, Houston...' Vince tosses the items into the back seat of the Caddy, VINCE Jesus! Vince, the most amazing thing has happened.
VINCE	You scared the living shit out of me --
JULIUS	I met one of our fathers. He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is. VINCE Great. Julius, in his fervor, grips Vince by the shoulders.
JULIUS	She didn't abandon you -- she didn't even know you were born!
VINCE	Awww -- that's terrible. Vince removes Julius's hands, slides him away from the
JULIUS	And she was told that I died!
VINCE	Look, Julius, I'm in kind of a hurry. Sammy wants me to take the car to Houston. Much bigger bucks when you raffle for charity in Houston. Julius takes the map from Vince, looks at it.
JULIUS	-- New Mexico is on the way to Houston.
VINCE	A lot of places are on the way to Houston. I'll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill. Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me.
JULIUS	Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico! VINCE No we don't. JULIUS Yes we do! And I'm coming with you!
VINCE	You know -- you're right. This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that --
JULIUS	You're right -- I'll take a shower -- be right back -- cake, complete with lit candles. VINCE Why does everybody have to like me so much? Vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him,
LINDA	Happy birthday, Vince. VINCE Oh please -- It's not my birthday anymore -- MARNIE Happy birthday, Vince. Is Julius around?
VINCE *	He's inside. * Marnie walks into the house. * LINDA Where are you going? VINCE Nowhere --
LINDA	You were going somewhere -- you weren't even going to say goodbye --
VINCE	Okay, okay -- look, you can't tell anybody this -- not even your sister -- but I'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it. LINDA Like what?
VINCE	I got something in here -- -- I don't even know what it is -- that's worth a fortune!
LINDA	A fortune! That's great!
NEIGHBOR	Never sleep with that man. Never loan him money. And never believe a word he tells you -- that's free advice. She slams the door shut.
LINDA	Vince...? VINCE I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once... LINDA I'm coming with you. I'm not letting you out of my sight.
VINCE	No you're not.
LINDA	I am because if you say 'no' one more time -- -- I'll tell everybody you're hiding a fortune in your -- VINCE Okay, okay. Just don't let on to Julius. He thinks we're going in 'Roots' or something. 'Put on your red dress, baby, 'cause we're going out tonight...' She puts the photo back as the sound of SHOWER STOPS.
JULIUS	Marnie -- excuse me -- I was just taking a shower.
MARNIE	I heard you singing -- I baked some cookies for you.
An awkward silence. *	MARNIE * I guess it was a dumb idea. *
JULIUS	Not at all -- I'm really looking * forward to tasting them. * I should put on some clothes -- But I'm not sure...
MARNIE	Oh -- don't mind me. She turns her back to him. JULIUS I hope Vince doesn't mind if I borrow one of his shirts. MARNIE Just don't try wearing his pants. They both turn as --
LINDA	throws open the door, with a big smile on her face.
LINDA	Guess what? Vince just invited us all to go to New Mexico and Texas. Vince comes in behind Linda, trying to conceal his
JULIUS	That's a great idea, Vince. HOLD. Now, from the opposite direction comes another car. and as he does -- As Webster unfolds it, reads Beetroot McKinley's name,
BURT KLANE (O.S.)	Open up, Benedict! I know you're in there!
WEBSTER	Your owner seems to be a very popular fellow these days. Morris has his elbow in a sling and a bandage on his
WEBSTER	Howdy.
BURT KLANE	Who are you? WEBSTER It's not really important, is it? I wanted to feed the cat before I left. Webster starts for the door. Morris (the really big one) BURT KLANE I asked you a question.
WEBSTER	Who are you?
BOB	We're the Klane brothers. That's Burt and Morris -- I'm Bob.
WEBSTER	Interesting genetic pool. You're looking for Vince Benedict, right? The brothers all nod.
WEBSTER	Am I Vince Benedict? Morris stares hard at him, shakes his head.
WEBSTER	So what's the difference who I am?
BURT KLANE	Hit him, Bob.
WEBSTER	Your brothers seem to have a problem with their feet. It could be contagious.
WEBSTER	Have a good, good day. Vince watches through the rearview mirror, knows what's LINDA Did Julius like the cookies? Marnie shrugs.
MARNIE	I'm not sure... he said they'd provide one hundred percent of the average daily requirement of fourteen source vitamins in a high-fiber form that's an integral part of a properly balanced diet.
LINDA	I think that's good.
MARNIE	I really hope so.
VINCE	This ought to fit you. Julius removes the shirt he borrowed from Vince, who
VINCE	Whoa -- get away from that window! There's women and children out there! What is wrong with you?
JULIUS	What? VINCE You allergic to something? JULIUS No. Why? What are those bumps doing all over your body? You're all swelled up. You look like you're about to explode.
JULIUS	We can't all be born beautiful like you, Vince. Some of us -- Julius puts on the T-shirt and looks at himself in a
VINCE	-- Are just born to be bad. It's you, Julius. Oooh, you are so scary... MARNIE Julius... As he walks past, Julius slaps her five. JULIUS Let's rock and roll. He opens the car door and climbs in. VINCE It's his first T-shirt.
MARNIE	Good luck. *
JULIUS	Thank you.
MARNIE	See you later.
VINCE	See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed, okay? Linda smiles at him, and winks. Julius, misunderstanding
JULIUS	That's not necessary. I always sleep on the floor. Vince looks askance at Julius, then pulls the car away. The Caddy drives through this mysterious town in the VINCE Now promise me something. If this professor Traven says he's never heard of Mom, and us twins, and all our dads, and the experiment, I don't want you to be upset. -- Because this is entirely possible.
JULIUS	You still think I'm making it all up, don't you? TRAVEN I don't know who you are and I * don't know what you're talking * about. Now get the hell out of * here before I call security.
VINCE	Well, that's that. On to Houston. He leads a stunned Julius down the corridor, towards
JULIUS	He's lying!
VINCE	Keep your voice down. This place is crawling with security -- *
JULIUS	For the first time in my life, I am -- -- pissed off!
VINCE	Don't do this to me. I got a car to deliver. The last thing I need is a detour in the slammer -- Julius furiously stops and turns around.
JULIUS	I'm going to make him tell us the truth...
VINCE	No... Julius shrugs Vince aside, approaches Traven and shoves * JULIUS That's our mother -- those are our six fathers -- that's Werner -- and that's you! Start talking! TRAVEN You turned out just like I thought you would, Vincent. What did you do, escape from prison? Vince stops dead, shell-shocked.
VINCE	... How did you know my name? TRAVEN I named you. Vince's jaw drops as he realizes -- *
VINCE *	Holy shit. It's all true. *
LABORATORY DOOR	Chained and padlocked. Traven unlocks it, pulls off the The very same one we saw in our opening, now covered in TRAVEN This room was sealed as soon as your mother gave birth. TRAVEN You came out first, of course... We weren't expecting him.
VINCE	gazes at the "blender" we saw Traven demonstrating in
VINCE	This must be where you made the milkshake... TRAVEN TRAVEN We weren't making milkshakes. We were making the most fully- developed human the world has ever seen. VINCE But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom.
TRAVEN	Wrong. The embryo split in two, but it didn't split equally. All * the purity and strength went into Julius. All the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every morning. VINCE Whoa -- I'm the crap? JULIUS It's not true, Vince.
VINCE	No, I want to hear this. I'm left-over crap? I'm no good?
JULIUS	He's wrong. TRAVEN Just look at him --
VINCE	You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?! TRAVEN You haven't got the brainpower to understand this -- Vincent, and I haven't got the time -- show's over. Julius grabs Traven, slams him up against the wall.
JULIUS	Tell us where our mother is... * dickhead!
TRAVEN	Whispering Pines... it's an artists colony... two hundred miles north of Santa Fe. JULIUS If you're lying to me. I'll be back. Julius tosses him aside.
VINCE	My life just got flushed down the toilet.
JULIUS	You're wrong, Vincent. Your life's just about to begin. VINCE I'm genetic garbage.
JULIUS	Vincent, we're twins. * VINCE I know this is a touchy subject * for you, Julius. But the fact is, * we don't look the same -- we don't * act the same, we don't talk the * same -- we don't dress the same. *
JULIUS	I know.
VINCE	So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different. *
JULIUS	We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people. Vince is starting to get interested again. VINCE Yeah?
JULIUS	And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that.
JULIUS	You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes. JULIUS You're the missing part of my life and I'm the missing part of your life. And when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers. We won't be alone anymore, Vince. We can be a family. Vince looks at his brother. A beat.
VINCE	A family? You really think so?
VINCE	With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees...
JULIUS	... and a real home where you'll always be welcome. VINCE Always?
JULIUS	Even when you've been bad. JULIUS Is this necessary?
VINCE	I'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania. You need some new clothes.
SALES CLERK	Can I help you, sir? VINCE Do I look like I need help? Here's the problem. Maybe I'll try on a couple of things myself.
JULIUS	Do I look okay?
VINCE	You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see * Frankenstein?
JULIUS	I read the book. VINCE That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music. I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white * guys. *
VINCE	Like this... You just got to try to be cool, you know? Try these on.
Indicating glasses.	Julius puts on sunglasses, snaps his fingers, tries to
JULIUS *	Am I cool now? -- * VINCE * Mr. Ice. *
MARNIE/LINDA	Wow!
JULIUS	We know where to find our momma! VINCE Everything Julius said was true. I'm the product of geniuses! LINDA I always knew that.
VINCE	Of course, but it's nice to make it official. JULIUS * Tommorrow we're going to finally meet our mother. VINCE * And tonight we celebrate! bothering him. JULIUS Vince, you've got to help me -- I've never been out on a date before... what should I do?
VINCE	Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance.
JULIUS	Dance?
VINCE	I guess you haven't done that before either. Julius shakes his head.
VINCE	Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her.
JULIUS	You dance with them? *
VINCE	It turns them to putty in your hands. He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room.
VINCE	Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet -- JULIUS -- Thank you for this, Vince --
VINCE	-- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! -- Julius looks at his brother, then self-consciously takes
VINCE	I'll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three, turn... ... put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth -- Vince begins to take Julius through the steps slowly at VINCE Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced. JULIUS Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt?
MARNIE	Er... no...
JULIUS	Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process. LINDA You sure know a lot about beer.
MARNIE	He knows a lot about everything. Julius polishes off the bottle, belches. But it's all from books. Until tonight I never had a beer. All theory, no practice -- the story of my life!
VINCE	Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling
JULIUS	Can I ask you a question?
MARNIE	Anything... JULIUS Am I shit-faced yet? Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer.
MARNIE	You're getting there. Vince gets to his feet. VINCE Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating.
JULIUS	I better see if mine are, too. Julius takes off after Vince.
JULIUS	You do that too, huh?
VINCE	Not all the time. Listen, Marnie's got the hots for you. Tonight could be your lucky night...
JULIUS	I don't think she really likes me.
VINCE	Piece of cake. You're nervous 'cause it's your first time. Perfectly natural.
JULIUS	Were you nervous?
VINCE	I was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure. They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the
VINCE	I got to admit it, Jules -- since I met you, life is getting better all the time. Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings. He
JULIUS	For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm so happy, I want to pick you up and hug you! Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters.
VINCE	Hey, cut it out! Not in here! Julius releases Vince, who clocks the other man's
VINCE	Go easy on the beer, okay? Lookin' forward to it.
BEETROOT	Sorry, Webster, looks like I'm doin' business with someone else. WEBSTER I'd do the same thing. You want the delivery, it's not your problem who delivers. If you ever need me, my answering service forwards all messages. And he's gone. BEETROOT Put this in my personal file. God, I love a professional... LINDA Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa Fe? MARNIE Well, I phoned work and told them we wouldn't be coming in for a few days... Oh, I forgot to tell you -- we've been fired.
LINDA	Let's go to the ladies' room. MARNIE But we just went. Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as --
BURT AND BOB KLANE	each with a cast on his foot, each supported by a crutch, BURT KLANE Hello, girls -- Do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you?
BURT KLANE	This has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency. BOB KLANE We don't like getting shot. *
VINCE	What are you talking about? We didn't shoot anybody. BURT KLANE It's no way to do business.
JULIUS	What do you want?
BURT KLANE	We want to take Vince out to the parking lot and kill him. A long beat.
VINCE	That's kind of drastic, don't you think?
MORRIS KLANE	Let's go. JULIUS Don't touch him.
BURT KLANE	This is not your problem -- you * don't want me to hurt these lovely ladies, do you? He pushes his gun into Marnie's side. MARNIE -- Ow!
JULIUS	You moved too soon... BURT KLANE What? JULIUS The second rule in a crisis situation:
MORRIS KLANE	He's starting that funny talk again... JULIUS If you choose to bluff, you must be prepared to have your bluff called. BURT KLANE This is no bluff -- Asshole --
BURT KLANE	Meet my cousins. Get these jerks outside. Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front Klanes are out cold.
VINCE	How many of those... rules do you have?
JULIUS	Quite a few. They were formulated by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life. VINCE I bet.
OMITTED A142	
VINCE	Uh... we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape.
JULIUS	Where you going?
VINCE	I thought I'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night.
VINCE	Maybe read her a bedtime story. Don't wait up for me.
JULIUS	What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight -- We've got this great room. It just doesn't get any better than this. VINCE Oh yes it does. showing a clip of the "3 Stooges" at their moronic best. He freezes at the sound of a KNOCK at the DOOR. Embar- You forgot your key -- I know. Lucky I waited up. Julius opens the door, revealing Marnie, who walks in JULIUS * Hi. *
MARNIE	Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be * alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to stay here. Which bed should I take? JULIUS Either... I always sleep on the floor. MARNIE Good night. JULIUS Good night. Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed Silence... MARNIE This mattress is awful. Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow MARNIE Sorry. Good night.
JULIUS	Good night.
MARNIE	This mattress is just as bad as the other one. MARNIE This is better... Good night.
JULIUS	Good night.
JULIUS	Are you cold?
MARNIE	It's alright.
JULIUS	No, please, take my shirt. I'm * baking. Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it JULIUS You still cold?
MARNIE	Just my legs. JULIUS Well, I could give you my...
MARNIE	Thanks.
JULIUS	Anything else? MARNIE I'd love a glass of water.
JULIUS	Right. MARNIE Thanks.
MARNIE	Oh, great!
MARNIE	Do you mind if I share your blanket? -- Mine's all wet.
JULIUS	No -- that would be okay. They both lie down under his blanket. Silence... MARNIE Could we switch sides? I like to sleep on the left. JULIUS Sure. She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly MARNIE Can I ask you something for a change? JULIUS Anything.
MARNIE	Do you like me? I mean, even a little bit?
JULIUS	I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie. But there's something about me you ought to know. MARNIE What?
JULIUS	I'm a virgin. VINCE -- Eighteen -- nineteen -- LINDA You sick or something? VINCE Julius gave me a few pointers -- -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best. LINDA She'll love you whatever you look like.
VINCE	I know she will -- I have that effect on people -- -- One hundred and forty-three -- * one forty-four -- * -- I just hope she's not too disappointed in Julius -- he can't help how weird he seems at the start --
LINDA	I think you're nervous.
VINCE	Hey -- I sleep great every night -- -- what if she's disappointed in me? LINDA C'mere.
VINCE	Five hundred. Don't want to overdo. He goes into her arms. LINDA If she's disappointed in you, then she's a fake -- who could want more from a son?
VINCE	You're right. I couldn't do this without you, Linda.
LINDA	I know. That's why, when we get back, I think we should move in together. VINCE Whoa! Move in together?
LINDA	I'm not saying we have to get married or anything, and it's not about me wanting to keep an eye on you, either. I just want to live with you.
VINCE	I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night -- LINDA I promise not to try and make you happy unless you want me to. Vince is clearly unnerved by the twin emotional demands
VINCE	Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow. It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom.
LINDA	Am I really your best girl? VINCE There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore. LINDA There better not be, because... 'I only have eyes for you...' They kiss.
MARNIE	Are you sure you've never done this before?
JULIUS	I think I would have remembered... Let's get her some flowers.
VINCE	Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules.
MARNIE	And one from us -- Julius smiles happily at Vince's thoughtfulness. The car drives up a long, dusty driveway to the entrance, They approach the fortress-like gated entrance, gazing meeting their mother. JULIUS It's very beautiful, isn't it, Vince?
VINCE	Not to mention valuable -- real estate like this must be worth a fortune.
JULIUS	You mustn't always think of money.
VINCE	You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age. Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE
CUSTODIAN	Can I help you? JULIUS We'd like to see Miss Mary Anne Benedict, please.
CUSTODIAN	I'm afraid that's not possible.
VINCE	We've come a long way. I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us. CUSTODIAN I suggest you write a letter to the Benedict Foundation stating your business. The Custodian politely closes the door in their faces. A foundation? THE QUARTER JULIUS You think it's her? I do.
VINCE	Gotta be. Well, don't just stand there.
LINDA	Introduce yourselves. * As they take a step in the direction of the painter. Hey! back on the island. GARDENER Should you be here? VINCE That depends on how you feel personally about trespassing. GARDNER Is he always funny like that?
JULIUS	We'd like to see Mary Ann Benedict please; is she here?
GARDENER	'Course she's here -- -- climbing over the wall like that, I should call the police --
VINCE	Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing.
JULIUS	We're her sons.
VINCE	Twin sons.
GARDENER	-- You're comedians -- VINCE We're kind of a surprise.
GARDENER	I'll bet you are -- follow me. VINCE We were right --
JULIUS	-- It is her --
JULIUS	We thought that that woman --
VINCE	-- Is Mary Ann?
GARDENER	No -- This is an artist's colony; there's a lot of painters.
VINCE	This is some chunk of real estate -- Mom owns it all, I guess. They are heading toward a door in the garden wall.
GARDENER	You can't really own something like that view over there, or that sunset, can you?
VINCE	No, of course not.
JULIUS	I can't wait to meet her.
GARDENER	This way, please. The Gardener ushers them towards a door in the garden
GARDENER	Mary Anne Benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings. But for a brief period they were considered valuable. She used the money to buy Whispering Pines so that young artists would have a place to work. VINCE She's not famous anymore?
GARDENER	She never wanted to be famous. She just wanted to be left alone.
JULIUS	May I ask you a question? Why do you keep referring to her in the past tense? GARDENER Because she passed away, some time ago.
VINCE AND JULIUS	They look like they've been kicked in the stomach. VINCE But -- but you said she was here -- GARDENER She is -- I meant her spirit. Her spirit is always here. Excuse me. The Gardener gently closes the door in their faces. They haven't moved. Linda and Marnie try to console them.

VINCE	Can we get the hell out of here?
PAINTER	What was that all about?
GARDENER	These real estate developers won't be happy until they turn this place into a golf course. PAINTER Now they're climbing over the walls?
GARDENER	They're shameless. They'll try anything. Those men claimed to be my twin sons, if you can believe that. It was really quite disturbing.
PAINTER	Oh, Mary Anne, I am sorry... It's alright... You get over things. * I did have a child once, but he died * at birth... You ought to be so proud of your mother, Vince. She donated her house and her land and all her paintings to help young artists.
VINCE	Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda?
MARNIE	Vince, all she meant was --
VINCE	I know what she meant. And I know why she's here, too. It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money.
LINDA	You know that's not true.
VINCE	Bull-shit. Julius, who's been quiet and distant throughout, suddenly
JULIUS	Take it easy, Vincent. It's not her fault.
VINCE	You hear that, everybody? The * creature from the black lagoon * just put in his two bits. I * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother.
JULIUS	All I wanted was to make us into a family.
VINCE	Family, my butt. There's no family here. There's just me and three losers -- I'm leaving. LINDA Vince -- quit acting crazy --
MARNIE	He dumped us in the middle of New Mexico.
JULIUS	We'll be fine. And maybe he'll be better off alone. You don't know -- he's got something worth maybe millions in that trunk -- he could get himself killed delivering it. JULIUS He's been getting out of trouble all his life, he's good at it.
MARNIE	He may need you.
JULIUS	I don't know much anymore -- on the island I was smart. Here, I've only made things worse. MARNIE Don't you realize you could make things a lot worse if you don't do something. Julius -- you're still very smart it's just you're not thinking so well right now -- on account of what you found out at Whispering Pines -- but you're not alone, you know -- I mean, you live long enough, everyone's mother dies...
VINCE	Okay, Beetroot -- It's time. I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade?
OMITTED 155	
JULIUS	Don't worry, Linda. I found him once, I'll find him again.
MARNIE	Be careful... *
JULIUS	He turns away. MARNIE watching. He puts on his sunglasses and strides into the airport.
CLOSEUP OF JULIUS	standing -- waiting -- trying to pick up the scent... Hollywood. CREEP Got a light, pal? * Julius, without breaking stride, turns his head, looks JULIUS Don't fuck with me... pal. The Creep falls back. Step away from that car, Mr. Benedict.
VINCE	I thought we had a deal here.
BODYGUARD	This is it. VINCE This is what?
BEETROOT	You come here alone, unarmed? You're just a fool who stole a car, aren't you? It's a new, low- * cost fuel-injection system for * jet engines -- worth a fortune to * the company that brings it to the * market first. * What are you waiting for?
VINCE	Five million dollars --
BODYGUARD	You wanna count it? VINCE I trust you. Vince takes the case, gazes at the money, snaps it shut. The Caddy speeds away while Vince clutches the attache
WEBSTER	emerges from the shadows with a powerful pump action * Beetroot has a hole in his head, as well. It's filled with forklifts, cranes and various forms of WEBSTER All I want is the money, Benedict. Just give me what's mine and you can go back to stealing cars and screwing your best friend's wife. VINCE
WEBSTER	FIRING at the sound. He can't see Vince but he pours
WEBSTER	Pack it in, Vince, you're only wasting time -- I don't give a damn about you, just the money -- He's reloaded during this -- moving forward as we... moving in on the shattered window. A bit irritated.
WEBSTER	Vince, if you don't cut this horseshit I may have to hurt you.
JULIUS	Leave my brother alone! Vince, outside, really chugging away now, doing his best
JULIUS	I've got the money. WEBSTER Well don't be shy -- -- come on down.
VINCE	No way... this is bullshit... Julius, you putz. as Julius gracefully shinnies down a cable, lands near WEBSTER Just exactly who are you?
JULIUS	Vincent's twin brother -- we're in this together. WEBSTER Keep your hands that way. JULIUS Don't be nervous -- I hate violence and I never carry guns. Vince peering in through the window he jumped out of, VINCE Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit...
WEBSTER	'Shakespeare's Collected Works'?... 'The Mind of Confucius'?... 'Advanced Quantum Mechanics'?... What is this shit?
JULIUS	I needed something to read on the airplane.
WEBSTER	Yeah, well your flying days are over... flying through the air, landing near Webster's feet. Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire.
VINCE	hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius.
VINCE AND JULIUS	both with their hands up, look at one another and
VINCE	I am never going to forgive you for this.
JULIUS	You were going to get killed. I tried to distract him so you could escape. VINCE I had escaped. I was on my way to Brazil -- when I felt you. JULIUS So, why didn't you go?
VINCE	Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience! JULIUS Nobody ever said being good was easy. VINCE How am I going to survive out there? What are my friends going to think?
JULIUS	You haven't got any friends.
WEBSTER	Just what are you two talking about? VINCE Butt out, okay? This is family stuff, we're squabbling, it's personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere. Try Brazil. WEBSTER I doesn't work like that, you might talk to people -- Who wants it first.
JULIUS	Shoot him. This whole thing is his fault.
WEBSTER	Whatever you want.
VINCE	-- Hold it, don't I get a say in this? Webster points the shotgun at Vince, starts to squeeze
JULIUS	pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows Webster's weapon VINCE You can be an irritating pain -- but sometimes you come in handy. -- Where'd you get the gun? JULIUS From the dead man in the car. VINCE You should have checked if he had a gun, chump.
WEBSTER	He said he didn't believe in them.
JULIUS	I lied.
VINCE	Ooooh -- you lied? JULIUS I had to. Vince beams with deep fraternal pride. Then he turns to
VINCE	Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy. WEBSTER You got lucky.
WEBSTER	But your luck just ran out. A stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that Webster
WEBSTER	Drop the gun and give me back the case, or we're gonna have ourselves some barbecued Benedict. Julius drops the gun and Vince slowly hands back the
WEBSTER	Well, I guess this is goodbye. He raises the cigarette, ready to throw it. JULIUS Wait a minute. Webster looks up.
JULIUS	You've forgotten something. Webster grips the case tighter.
WEBSTER	I don't think so.
JULIUS	The third rule in a crisis situation.
WEBSTER	The third rule?
JULIUS	Duck. Suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane
VINCE	Duck? Duck? You are developing real style, Julius.
JULIUS	drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the JULIUS You came back for me.
VINCE	Yeah, yeah, yeah. JULIUS I always knew you would.
VINCE	You're my brother, right? We're family, right? JULIUS Thank you, Vincent.
VINCE	We're a rich family, right?
JULIUS	We're a good family. I'm sorry, Vince, but we have to return the money.
VINCE	Return the money?!? Are you nuts?!? This is dirty money, * Julius -- it doesn't belong to anybody --
JULIUS	-- Including us -- think how much * better you'll feel when it's out of our lives --
VINCE	-- I won't -- I won't feel one bit better -- I'll never feel better, not if I live to be... oh no -- * As the sound of POLICE SIRENS get LOUDER we --

"LONG LOST TWINS RECEIVE REWARD	RETURN CASH, STOLEN ENGINE"
PAINTER	I think you'd better read this...
MARY ANNE (O.S.) *	You stole my family, you lying son of a bitch!
VINCE	Linda, I -- LINDA What the hell are you doing here? VINCE You wouldn't answer my calls or my letters, so I... Look, I made a terrible mistake and I apologize and I want to tell you that I'm a changed man. Linda is almost buying it, but then --
LINDA	How did you get in here? VINCE Well, there was a window in the back that --
LINDA	Typical. She walks past him, approaches her door, puts in the
VINCE	All I ask is for another chance. I know I probably don't deserve it, but --
LINDA	You're right, you don't deserve it. ROSES
VINCE	I had to break into your apartment, but --
LINDA	Vince, they're beautiful. VINCE So, do you forgive me? Linda hesitates.
LINDA	Yes, but... VINCE But? Vince looks at her, understands.
VINCE	You mean, that matter we talked about once and never really resolved.
LINDA	What matter is that?
VINCE	The matter of you and me living together.
LINDA	What about it?
VINCE	Your place or mine? Julius is sorting through a stack of mail while Vince
VINCE	What do we do? Most people on this planet cause problems -- the Benedict Corporation solves them. We're a consulting firm -- a think-tank -- sort of like the Rand Corporation -- only smarter! Tuesday at three. See you then.
JULIUS	Look at this, Vince -- proposals from the Red Cross, UNICEF, the World Health Organization -- we should only have clients who do humanitarian work.
VINCE	Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know.
VINCE	Come in!
VINCE AND JULIUS	Confused, just look at her for a moment. MARY ANNE MARY ANNE It's so incredible I'm not even sure which one of you is which. VINCE AND JULIUS THREE OF THEM
MARY ANNE	You see, I didn't believe you, I mean who would believe a story like your story -- crazy -- They lied to me all these years... And they lied to you... But you found one another ... And you found me... Please -- God -- one of you say something.
VINCE	Momma? Mary Anne nods. JULIUS Mamma?
VINCE	MOMMA! They both run to Mary Anne and hug her for all she's
JULIUS	Watching them. Now there are tears on his face, too.
No words are necessary.	Slowly... FADE IN: CLOSE ON WERNER 181 Smiling happily. PULL BACK to reveal we are -- In front of the merry-go-round. Werner purchases a hand- MARY ANNE I just can't get over how alike they are... The three women all turn and gaze affectionately back at -- Vince and Julius both yawn simultaneously.
JULIUS	They kepp you up all night again, too? VINCE Sceaming in stereo.
JULIUS	I think you need your diaper changed. What a surprise -- so do you. VINCE Not you, too -- It's not a competition, you know. They both start pushing their strollers again.
JULIUS	Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together.
VINCE	Now that's a scary thought. They both yawn simultaneously once again. The merry-go-round starts moving, and the last image we FADE OUT.
