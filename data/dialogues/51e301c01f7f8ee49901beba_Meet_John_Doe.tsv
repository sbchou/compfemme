It's a commentary on what we laughingly call the civilized world. 'Dear Miss Mitchell: Four years ago I was fired out of my job. Since then I haven't been able to get another one. At first I was sore at the state administration because it's on account of the slimy politics here we have all this unemployment.

He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's and from now on we quote: "I protest, by John Doe." He protests against all the evils in the world; the greed, the lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's inhumanity to man.
Arguments will start. Should he commit	suicide or should he not! People will write in pleading with him. But no! No, sir! John Doe will remain adamant! On Christmas Eve, hot or cold, he goes!

People like the Governor and that fella	gonna talk about them. guys, the John Does. If anybody should ask you what the average John Doe is like, you couldn't tell him because he's a million and one things. He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small. He's simple and he's wise. He's inherently honest, but he's got a streak of larceny in his heart. He seldom walks up to a public telephone without shoving his finger into the slot to see if somebody left a nickel there. to. He's Joe Doakes,[8] the world's greatest stooge and the world's greatest strength. the John Does. We're the meek who are, er, supposed to inherit the earth. You'll find us everywhere.

You're gonna need him and he's gonna need you . . . so look he's hungry, feed him! If he's out of a job, find him one! To most of you, your neighbor is a stranger, a guy with a barking dog, and a high fence around guy that's on your own team.

There's something swell about the spirit of Christmas, to see what it does to people, all kinds of people . . . year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if each and every John Doe would make that spirit last three hundred and sixty-five days out of the year, we'd develop such a strength, we'd create such a tidal wave of good will, that no human force could stand against it. inherit the earth when the John Does start loving their neighbors. You'd better start right now. Don't wait till the game is called on account of darkness! Wake up, John Doe! You're the hope of the world! radio station rings with cheers.

He's a cranky old man and runs a second-hand him for years. I always figured he was an ornery old gent that hated the world cause he was always slamming his garage door and playing the radio so loud he kept half the neighbors up. the hedge straightening out a dent in me out of the window. She says, "Go on. Speak to him, Bert." And I figured, well, heck, I can't lose anythingso I yelled over to him "Good morning, Mr. Smithers." He went right on pounding and she said, "Louder, louder. He didn't hear you." So, in a voice you could of heard in the next county, I yelled. "Good morning, Mr. Smithers!" around surprised like, and he put on a big smile, came over and took my hand like an old lodge brother, and he said. "Good morning, Hansen. I've been wanting to talk to you for years, only I thought you didn't like me." And then he started chatting away like a happy little kid, and he got so excited his eyes begin waterin' up. I found out Smithers is a swell egg, only he's pretty deaf, and that accounts for all the noises. we know about our neighbors, and then he got an idea, and he said, "How's about inviting everybody some place where we can all get together and know each other a little better?" Well, I'm feeling so good by this time, I'm ripe for anything. school house and I tell everybody that comes in the store, including Mr. Schwabacher, people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another. and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club.

The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells
us about how they cancelled their milk	last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving." furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it. we got them to the meeting. What a reception with them and made a fuss over them, and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney just sat right down and cried. you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says. together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful?

I get b-boiling mad. And right now, John, I'm sizzling! myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean? if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you? it because you're gentle. But that's what you're doing. You're mixed up with a skunk, my boy, a no-good, dangerous skunk! are you? he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs. aren't you? that could only happen right here in the good old U.S.A. And I think it's terrific! What do you think of that! Me! Hard-boiled Connell! I think it's plenty terrific!
Two shot: John is rather pleased to	D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh? politics. That's the main idea. a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now?

Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body! the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used! anything! people exactly what you and all your fine-feathered friends here are trying to cook up for them! B.! wants to talk to you.
Listen to me, my son! Before you lose	your head completely, may I remind you that I picked you up out of the gutter and I can throw you right back there again! You've got a nerve accusing people of things! These gentlemen and I know what's the best for the John Does of America, regardless of what tramps like you think!
Get off that righteous horse of yours	and come to your senses. You're the fake! We believe in what we're doing! You're the one that was paid the thirty pieces of silver! Have you forgotten that? Well, I haven't! it! You're the big hero that's supposed to jump off tall buildings and things! Do you remember? What do you suppose your precious John Does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it? That you were being paid to say so? You're lucky if they don't run you out of the country! we can kill the John Doe movement deader than a doornail, and we'll do it, too, the moment you step out of line! Now, if you still want to go to that convention and shoot your trap off, you go ahead and do it! kill the John Doe movement if you can't use it to get what you want? and think of deliberately killing an idea that's made millions of people a little bit happier! An idea that's brought thousands of them here from all over the country, by bus and by freight, in jallopies and on footso they could pass on to each other their a lot of things. Why, your type's old as history. If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, if you can't eat something, you bury it! finding out that the guy next door isn't a bad egg. That's simple, isn't it? And yet a thing like that's got a chance of spreading till it touches every last doggone human being in the worldand you talk about killing it! hunger and more hate. And what's to prevent that from starting all over again? Nobody knows the answer to that one, and certainly not you, with those slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! The John Doe idea may be the answer, though! It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it! do it in a million years, with all your radio stations and all your power! Because It's bigger than your ambitions! And it's bigger than all the bracelets and fur coats in the world! Uncle's been too good to motorcycle troops who wait around to escort D.

Camera retreats in front of him as he	takes a cigar and shoves it into his mouth. Just as he is about to light it, he becomes aware of the signing, the children saying, "Thank you, sir! Merry Christmas!" D. B.'s mouth screws up, unhappily. It is far from a "merry" phone call which the SERGEANT is now answering. huh? Okay, lady.
