PILOTS.	From 1964 to 1966 I successfully impersonated an airline pilot for Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two million miles for free. During that time I was also the Chief Resident Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital, the Assistant Attorney General for the state of Louisiana, and a Professor of American History at a prestigious University in France. By the time I was caught and sentenced to prison, I had cashed over six million dollars in fraudulent checks in 26 foreign countries and all fifty states, and I did it all before my 18th birthday. To this day, I am the only teenager ever to have been placed on the FBI' s most wanted list. My name is a Abagna l e Jr. Warm applause as the THREE MEN walk behind a desk that faces the pa They all sit down at exactly Okay, panel, you have ork cut out for you.

JOE SHAYE	Help you? Yes, I'll help you, Frank.
N	Why do you think I've been fighting to have you extradited. Why do you think I came to take you home? Do you know that 21 other countries want'you in their prisons? I saw the list -- Egypt was on there. Who the hell goes to Egypt to write bad checks?
FRANK	I'm sick... please...
JOE SHAYE	Don't worry, Frank, you just have to make it through one more night. And then tomorrow I'll help you onto a plane, clean you up, and put you in a cell for the next twenty-five years. Debbie Zane - 5 S. His face covered by a beard and matted black hair. Frank

FRANK	Okay, Joe...let's go home. A smoke filled oak dining room packed with CLUB MEMBERS -- the stage.
JACK WRIGHT	The New Rochelle Rotary Club has a history that goes back to 1859. In all those years, we have only inducted a handful of deserving men as lifetime members, an honor that has seen 187 names enshrined on the wall of honor. Tonight, we make it 188. So please stand, as I present my good friend, Frank William Abagnale. Applause all around as FRANK ABAGNALE SR. steps up to the
FRANK SR.	Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned, but the second mouse wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard, Debbie Zane - that he eventually churned that cream into butter -- and crawled out. Gentleman, as of this moment, I am that second mouse. Laughter from the men in the room as Frank continues. I stand here today humbled by the presence of Mayor Allen, and our club President, Jack Wright. But most of all, I am honored to see my loving wife, Paula, and my son, Frank Jr., sitting in the front-row. I'm just a business man, a working stiff -- but tonight you have made me royalty. And for this, I am eternally grateful. The men applaud as Frank Sr. smiles down at his wife and
PAULA	You're a better dancer than your father, Frankie. The girls don't know what they're in for.
FRANK SR.	Paula, show him the dance you were doing when we met.
PAULA	Who can remember?
FRANK SR.	The people in that little French Village were so happy to see Americans, that they decided to put on a show for us. Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK	I know the story, Dad.
FRANK SR.	So they cram two hundred soldiers into this tiny social hall, and the first person to walk on stage is your mother. And she starts to dance... Paula steps away from Frank, and she starts to dance a ballet,
FRANK SR. (cont'd)	It had been months since we had even seen a woman, and here's this blonde angel on stage -- and the men are literally holding their breath. And I turned to my buddies, and I said..
FRANK	I will not lea France without her. Paula spins around, accide1 49, ILLS HER GLASS OF WINE --
PAULA	Oh, shit, the rug! I b relieve I did that. Frankie, run /get a towel... As Frank runs off, Paula drops to her knees and scrubs the
PAULA (CONT'D)	This will never come out. She looks up at her husband.
PAULA (CONT'D)	Whenever I dance for you, I get in trouble. Debbie Zane -
FRANK SR.	Wake up, Frank... it's eight-thirty. Frank opens his eyes, stares at his father.
FRANK	I overslept. Mom's gonna kill me.
FRANK SR.	It's okay. You don't have to go to school today.
FRANK	Is it snowing?
FRANK SR.	Do you own a black suit?
FRANK	A black suit? Why?
FRANK SR.	We have a vermportant meeting in the city. plï¿½y( l

DARCY	we don't open for half an hour.
FRANK SR.	What's your name, ma'am?
DARCY	Darcy.
FRANK SR.	Darcy, that's a pretty name. I'm in a bit of fix -- I need a suit for my kid. This is my son, Frank, he needs Debbie Zane - 5 a black suit. There was a death in the family, my father, eighty-five years old, a war hero, there's a funeral this afternoon -- a military funeral -- planes flying overhead, twenty-one gun salute. Frank needs to borrow a suit for a couple of hours.
DARCY	I'm sorry. We don't loan suits, and we're not open. As she closes the door, Frank Sr. takes a small GOLD NECKLACE
FRANK SR.	Is this yours, Darcy? I just found it in the parking lot? Darcy stares at the necklace through the door.
The Cadillac is parked somewh	Frank, now wearing a BLACK SUIT a his father gets out of the car andclimbs into the back seat
FRANK SR.	Slide over. You're gonna take me to Chase Manhattan Bank. Just head up to seventy-second and Madison, pull up to the front and park next to the fire hydrant. Frank looks back at his father.
FRANK	Dad...I don't know how to drive.
FRANK SR.	A little more gas -- now slip it into second. That's good, more clutch, now pull into this lane here -- slowly! Don't honk at us you son of a bitch -- I'm teaching my kid to drive! You're doing fine, Frank, just pick a lane and slip it into third -- about one- o'clock -- push it hard. Frank slips it into third. Perfect! Now you got it! Look at you, Frank, t is your town -- you're goin s aight up Broadway! EMPLOYEES ARE HELPING CUST RS the hushed silence of the
FRANK SR.	Okay. Stop grinning. When I get inside you go back to the front seat and wait. Even if a cop comes and writes you a ticket, you don't move the car, understood?
FRANK	Dad... is this really gonna help?
FRANK SR.	You know why the Yankees always win, Frank?
FRANK	They have Mickey Mantle? Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK SR.	No. It's because the other teams can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes. Frank Sr. steps out from the Cadillac, grabs his briefcase. Watch this, Frank. The manager of Chase Manhattan bank is about to open the door for your father. As Frank Sr. casually walks toward the doors of Chase
LOAN OFFICER	You've owned stationery store for how man rs?
LOAN OF	Mr. Abagnale, we don' `)1y loan money to people who hav resolved business with the I.R.S..
FRANK SR.	That's just a misunderstanding. I hired the wrong guy to do my books, a mistake anyone could make. I wouldn't even consider that if I were you.
LOAN OFFICER	You want me to ignore the fact that the government is demanding two years back taxes?
FRANK SR.	My store is a landmark in New Rochelle. I have customers all over New Jersey. Debbie Zane -
LOAN OFFICER	Sir, you're not a customer of Chase Manhattan. We don't know you. I'm sure you're bank in New Rochelle...
FRANK SR.	My bank went out of business. Banks like this put them out of business. Frank Sr. leans in, lowers his voice. Now I know I made a mistake, I admit that. But these people want blood -- they want my store -- they've threatened to put me in jail. This is America, right, I'm not a criminal. I'm a medal of honor winner, a lifetime member of the New Rochelle Rotary Club. All I'm asking you to do is help me beat these guys.

FRANK (CONT'D)	I'm making pancakes.
FRANK SR.	We're not gonna eat pancakes for dinner on my son's sixteenth birthday. Frank turns to his father. Why are you looking at me like that? You thought I forgot? Frank opens his BRIEFCASE, takes out a CHECKBOOK FROM CHASE Debbie Zane - I opened a checking account in your name. I put twenty-five dollars in the account so you can buy whatever you want. Don't tell you mother. Frank slowly opens the CHECKBOOK, sees his name at the top
FRANK	But they turned down your loan?
FRANK SR.	Yeah. They all turned me down.
FRANK	So why open a bank account with them?
FRANK SR..	Because one day you'll want something from these people -- a house, a car -- they have all the money. There's a hundred check ere, Frank, which means from i day on -- you're in THE IMPALA pulls up to the f the local public High

VICE-PRIN ROWN	Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale, ï¿½1ï¿½ is not a question of your son's attendance.
PRINCIPAL EVANS	For the past week Frank has been teaching Ms. Glasser's French class.
PAULA	He what?
PRINCIPAL EVANS	Your son has been pretending to be a substitute teacher, lecturing the students, giving out homework.
VICE-PRINCIPAL BROWN	Ms. Glasser has been ill, and there was some confusion with the real sub -- we're still not sure what happened. Debbie Zane - 5
PRINCIPAL EVANS	Your son held a teacher-parent conference yesterday. He was planning a class field trip to a French bread factory in Trenton. Do you see the problem we have? Frank Sr. and Paula seem a bit confused.
PAULA	This is our fault, Principal Evans. Frank had been at Buckley since he was a little boy. We had to take him out for personal reasons, away from his friends -- you know how kids are. He's all alone here.
FRANK SR.	He's not alone. He has us.

SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR	I don't understand. Debbie Zane -
FRANK	When your mom hands you a note to miss school, you put it in your pocket. And if it was in his pocket, where's the crease?
FRANK SR.	Excuse me. I have to go to work.
PRINCIPAL EVANS	Sir, we have no choice but to suspend Frank for one week, and transfer him out of French and into German.
FRANK SR.	You're not suspending anyone. if you go after my son I'll go before the school board and ask them who's minding the ste at Monroe High.

JOANNA	Are you that transfer from Buckley? Frank looks a bit confused as he stares at the girls.
FRANK	Yes.
JOANNA	My name is Joanna Carlson, and I was wondering if you were going to the Junior Prom?
FRANK	No. I don't have a date yet. My name is Frank Abagnale.
JOANNA	Frank, do you think you could buy my' friends and I some beer before the dance? All the other guys are afraid to try.
FRANK	I'm only sixteen. How could I buy you beer?
JOANNA	If you're old enough to teach French, you're old enough to buy beer.
FRANK	Mom, I'm home. Nobody answers, and Fk'"slowly walks toward the back bedroom Frank's about to knock when thï¿½t b om door suddenly opens,
PAULA	That's all there is, two bedrooms, but we're getting used to it. Frankie, you remember Dad's friend Jack Wright from the club, he came by looking for your father -- I was giving him a tour of the apartment.
JACK WRIGHT	Very spacious, Paula.
FRANK	Dad's at work. Frank stares at Jack, who walks over and picks up his HAT Debbie Zane -
JACK WRIGHT	You look more like your old man every day. Thanks for the sandwich, Paula. I'll see ya later.

PAULA (CONT'D)	Do you need some money, Frankie, a few dollars to buy some record albums? Here, take five dollars. Paula holds out five dollars, and Frank walks toward her,
FRANK	You promised you were going to quit.
FRANK	This is a 925 sterlihkï¿½ ï¿½er Waldmann ballpoint pen V a two- color twist action top. Just turn it like this -- the ink changes from black to blue. Nine dollars.

FRANK SR.	It's over. I did it, Frank. The sons of bitches have called off the dogs -- read it and weep. I beat the United States government. Take a look at that. Frank Sr. hands Frank a letter. Debbie Zane - See what it says -- the I.R.S is backing off. They're gonna take their money and run -- no charges filed, no further investigations into this matter. They thought they could get me, and I sent Uncle Sam running for the hills.

For the record, I would like to praise both parents for showing such confidence in their son, who they believe will make the best decision for himself and his family.

MULLIGAN	Frank, I'm Paul Mulligan, head of security for Pan American World Airways. I understand you're writing a report about Pan Am, and you'd like to speak to a real live pilot. Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK	Yes, Sir.
MULLIGAN	Well you're in luck, son. Because I was one of the best.
FRANK	What does it mean when one pilot says to another pilot, "what kind of equipment are you on?"
MULLIGAN	He's asking what kind of plane they're flying. DC-10, 707, 727. What about a D. badges I've seen pilots wear. e
MU G	A pilot is requi of things with him at airline personnel b e similar to this Pan AA wearing, and his FAA li Mulligan pulls an old FAA LICENSE out of his wallet.
FRANK	Do you think I could make a copy of this license to put in my report?
MULLIGAN	You can have it, Frank. It expired five years ago.
FRANK	What about your I.D. badge? Do you have an extra one I could borrow?
MULLIGAN	I'm afraid I can't help you there. These badges are special ordered from Polaroid. The only way to get Debbie Zane -! one is to become a real live pilot for Pan Am. FRANK wears a suit and tie as he sits across from the salesman
FRANK	Caribbean Air will be expanding our routes next year to include most of the East coast. I'm thinking we'll need several thousand badges.
POLAROID SALESMAN	As you can see, we make the I.D. badges for almost every major airline.
POLAROI	That's Pan Am. Would o' Qke the brochure on that one?
FRANK	My boss wanted me to bring back an actual I.D. badge, not a brochure.
POLAROID SALESMAN	That's no problem, Mister Anderson. We make all the badges right here with this equipment. The Salesman motions to a large CAMERA AND LAMINATOR. I can make you one in a few seconds.
FRANK	I have an idea. Why don't you use me as the subject. Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK	Hello. I'm a Pan Am co-pilot and I'd like to fly on your two-thirty to Miami.
EASTERN TICKET AGENT	You want to dead-head to Miami?
FRANK	Yes. Dead-head. Frank hands the AGENT his I.D. BADGE and Mulligan's FAA
ERN TICKET AGENT	You' re in lyk""Sir. The jump seat is open. The Ticket Agent starts to la ,ï¿½ï¿½Y}cï¿½i Frank laughs with her.
MARCI	Are you my dead-head?
MARCI	Frank, this is Captain Oliver. That's John Paxton, the Co-Pilot, this is Ron Vega, flight engineer. Debbie Zane -!
FRANK	Frank Williams, Pan Am. Thanks for giving me a lift.
CAPTAIN OLIVER	Go ahead and take a seat, Frank, we're about to push. Frank continues to search for the JUMP SEAT, the panic
MARCI	There you go. Would you like a drink after take-off? Frank quickly sits in the jump-seat, his hands shaking as he
FRANK	A glass of milk, please. Frank is staring out the cockpit window in disbelief, the
MARCI	Hello, dead-head. Enjoying your free ride?
FRANK	Marci, did you drop this? Frank takes a SMALL GOLD NECKLACE out of his jacket pocket. Debbie Zane - 5 Must have slipped right off your neck.
FRANK	Are all hostesses as nice as you?
MA.RCI	Stewardess. You know we like to be called stewardess now. Why are you stopping?
FRANK	I want to tell you something, Marci. This is by far the best date I've ever been on. Is the jump-seat op no '1 j. ur four o'clock to Dallas? Frank is wearing his pilot's uniform as he walks up to LUCY,
LUCY	Welcome to Dallas National Bank, how may I help you?
FRANK	What's your name, Ma'am?
LUCY	Lucy Rogers. I'm the Assistant Manager.
FRANK	Lucy, my name is Frank Williams, and I'm a co-pilot for Pan Am. I'd like Debbie Zane - to cash this check and then take you to dinner.
LUCY	Okay, enough! I'm gonna be sick. I have to get home and get some sleep.
FRANK	It's only midnight.
LUCY	One of my tellers got married last night, and I'm gonna be short handed all week.
FRANK	What if I cane nd helped you out down at the

FRANK	To be close to you.
LUCY	We feed the checks through the micker machine, and the magic eye reads the micker ink and then sorts the checks by numbers.
FRANK	What numbers? Debbie Zane - 5
LUCY	See the numbers on the bottom of the` checks. Those are called routing numbers.
FRANK	Where do the checks get routed to?
LUCY	Well, I'm not exactly sure. Nobody ever asked before.
FRANK	would you keep it down, please? The students immediatel uiet down as Frank turns a page in

I	maybe one day we'll race to Atlantic City.
FRANK	I went by the store today. Since when do you close on a Friday?
FRANK SR.	I had to close the store for awhile. It's all about timing, Frank, the goddamn government knows that. They hit you when you're down, and I wasn't gonna let them take it from me. So I just shut the doors myself, called their bluff.
FRANK	I can get you money, whatever you need. We can buy ten stores. Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK SR.	No. It's better this way. I'm laying' low for awhile, letting them have their fun. It's just a stationery store -- sooner or later they'll forget about me.
FRANK	Have you talked to Mom?
FRANK SR.	She's so stubborn, your mother. But I won't let her go without a fight. I've been fighting for her since the day we met.
FRANK	Out of all those soldiers, you were the one that took her home.
FRANK SR.	That's right. Two hundred men were sitting in th' little social hall watching he d ce. What was the name of tha d I/ ..il lage? Montpelier.
FRANK S	I didn't speak a word six weeks later she was A WOMAN PULLS UP IN AN OLD FORD AND HONKS FOR FRANK SR.. She Shit. I have to go, Frank.
FRANK	I was hoping I could buy you a steak.
FRANK SR.	Jesus, tonight is no good. That's my friend, Darlene. She's cooking me dinner for my birthday. She used to be the pastry chef at Elaines. Why don't you come home with us? Debbie Zane -
FRANK	No, I should probably get out to the airport. I'm flying the red eye tonight.
FRANK SR.	Where are you going?
FRANK	Dad, I'm serious about what I said. I can get you money --whatever you need.
FRANK SR.	Just tell me where you're going. I bet it's someplace warm.
FRANK	Yeah. Hawaii.
FRANK SR.	Hawaii. My son is going to Hawaii tonight. The x t of us really are suckers.
CLOSE ON	A SLIDE PROJECTOR -- the circular tray turning clockwise as
JOE SHAYE	John Doe 2172 is a paperhanger who started on the East Coast. During the last few weeks 2172 has developed a new form of check fraud, which I'm calling "the float". Next slide. The slide doesn't change. Next slide, please. Debbie Zane - 5
FBI AGENT	The remote thing is broken. You'll have to do it by hand. Joe reaches in and turns the slide. What he's doing is opening checking accounts all over the country, then changing the micker ink routing numbers on the bottom of those checks.
CLOSE ON	THE FACES OF THE FIVE FBI AGENTS, looking bored as they all This is a map of the 12 branches of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The optical scanners at t bank read the numbers on the bott a check -- then ship the ch c}ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½f,? to the Joe, for those of with bank fraud, wo telling us what the h talking about?
JOE SHAYE	The East Coast branches are numbered seven through twelve, the midwest four, five, and six...
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	You mean to say that those numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something?
JOE SHAYE	Yes. And if you change a number one to a number nine -- a check cashed in New York won't be sent to the East Coast Reserve -- but will be re- routed all the way to California. The bank won't know the check has bounced for two weeks, which means Debbie Zane - this guy can stay in one place -- rob the same banks over and over. The AGENTS literally scratch their heads, trying to follow.
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	And this is why you called for an emergency briefing? Because of a couple of bounced checks? Laughter from the other Agents as Joe tries to smile.
JOE SHAYE	Sean, I was hoping to get-some back- up on this.
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	You want my wife to help you? She's the one who balances the checkbook at home?
FBI AGENTS AMDURSKY AND	Hollywood. Fox sits in the

AMDURSKY (CONT'D)	That's a funny story. People always laugh at that story.
JOE SHAYE	Let me ask you something, Amdursky. if you had so much fun working undercover, why did you transfer into bank fraud? Debbie Zane - 5
AGENT AMDURSKY	I didn't transfer. I was demoted. Demoted is the wrong word. It was more like-punished. I screwed up in the field.
JOE SHAYE	What about you, Mr. Fox? Did you fuck up in the field and get punished?
FOX	No. I've never worked in the field before. I was in the L.A. public relations office, but we were shut down after the riots.
JOE SHAYE	That's just great. I ask for backup, they drag the bottom of the Pacific.
AMDURSKY	Can I ask you mething, Joe? How come you're o erious all the time?
JOE SHAYE	Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?
FOX	A little, I guess.
JOE SHAYE	Would you guys like to hear me tell a joke?
AGENT AMDURSKY	Yeah. We'd love to hear a joke from you.
JOE SHAYE	Knock Knock.
AGENT AMDURSKY	Who's there? Debbie Zane -
JOE SHAYE	Go fuck yourselves.
MOTEL OWNER	He's been here two weeks, written lots of checks. The one that bounced was for twenty dollars, and he took care of it right away.
JOE SHAYE	Nobody is goin to blame you. The bank called u He's probably not the man we' oking for.

MOTEL OWNER	He gave me one yesterday. The owner takes a check out of the register, hands it to
JOE SHAYE	I don't believe it. You guys stay here, watch the front.
AMDURSKY	Stay here? This guy's a check forger, a goddamn paperhanger. He doesn't even carry a gun.
FOX	Why can't we go with you, Joe? Debbie Zane - 5
JOE SHAYE	Just be quiet and watch the front. And if you're good, I'll take you both for ice cream when we're finished. at the end of the second floor hallway, the DO NOT DISTURB Joe creeps along the walYh s gun straight out, his face Freeze! FBI! Don't you move! Put your hands on your head or I'll shoot you! Frank slowly turns to face Joe. The two men stare at each
FRANK	Relax, buddy, you're late. My name is Johnson, Secret Service. Our boy just tried to climb out the window -- my partner has him cuffed in the alley downstairs.
JOE SHAYE	Secret Service? What are you talking about? Keep your hands in the air. Debbie Zane -
FRANK	You think the FBI are the only ones tracking this guy. We've been following a paper trail for months, almost had him in New York. Would you mind taking that gun out of my face, it makes me nervous.
JOE SHAYE	Let me see some identification.
FRANK	Here. Take my whole wallet. Frank throws his wallet to Joe, who catches it with his free You want my gun, too? Come over here and take my gun! Frank opens his jacket, but not wide enough for Joe to see

JOE SHAYE	I'm sorry. I got a little carried away. I didn't expect Secret Service on this.
FRANK	Counterfeiting is our thing.
JOE SHAYE	I know. I know. I just wasn't expecting...
FRANK	Don't worry about it. This is his typewriter. I'm gonna go lock it in my trunk. Do me a favor and guard his room for a minute. Frank starts moving toward the back stairwell. Debbie Zane - 5 And yell down to my partner in the alley -- tell him I'm on my way. Frank starts to walk down back stairwell. He looks back at
FRANK (CONT'D)	What's your name, anyway?
JOE SHAYE	Joe Shaye.
FRANK	Tough luck, Joe. Five minutes earlier and you would have landed yourself a pretty good collar. Frank starts walking down the stairs.
JOE SHAYE	Wait. ,ï¿½4back to Joe. Frank stops, slowly ty Your wallet.
FRANK	Hang onto it for a pu`% , I trust you. Frank walks downstairs, opens the EMERGENCY EXIT that leads Debbie Zane -
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	I've cleared Amdursky and Fox in this John Doe thing.
JOE SHAYE	Thanks, Sean. It was my call all the way.
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	Sometimes we all get a little lost out there. No shame in being rusty. You want to talk about it?
JOE SHAYE	Not really. I made a mistake.
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	Forget about it. There are hundreds of John Doe's out there.
JOE SHAYE	Yeah, but I'm gonna get this one. The worst thi a paperhanger can do is show is I saw him, I heard his voice -- r s nothing for him to hide beiin (nï¿½

JOE SHAYE	what position is that?
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	The position of being humiliated. Joe stares at Wilkes, slowly stands and heads for the door.
JOE SHAYE	Hey, Sean, you want to hear a joke?
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	Sure. Debbie Zane - 5
JOE SHAYE	Knock knock.
FRANK	Do you have any ketchup, Richard?

JOE SHAYE	is looking through a giant PRINT BOOK -- tediously searching
JOE SHAYE (ON PHONE)	This is Shaye. Merry Christmas. Debbie Zane -
FRANK	Hello, Joe.
JOE SHAYE	Who is this?
FRANK	Johnson, Secret Service. Joe sits up at his desk, grabs a pencil and paper.
JOE SHAYE	John Doe 2172?
FRANK	I've been trying to track you down for a couple of hours. Did you know that most people in the FBI have no idea who you are or what you do?
JOE SHAYE	What do you want? happened out li'n>Zo ngeles .
JOE	Fuck you. Don't yo ize to me. I'm the one that's Rn t you in jail.
FRANK	Joe, do you always work on Christmas Eve? Joe looks around the room before he answers.
JOE SHAYE	I volunteered, so that men with families could go home early.
FRANK	You were wearing a wedding ring in L.A.. I thought maybe you had a family?
JOE SHAYE	No. I've never been married.
FRANK	How come? Debbie Zane - 5
JOE SHAYE	You want to talk to me, let's talk face to face.
FRANK	Okay. I'm at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. Suite 3113. Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly stops himself.
JOE SHAYE	You think you're gonna get me again, don't you? You'd love for me to send twenty agents out on Christmas Eve to barge into that hotel, break down doors so you can make a fool out of me again?
FRANK	Joe, I'm sorry if I made a fool out of you.
J SHAYS	Goddamn it, o t you feel sorry for me. The tru h knew it was you. Maybe I didn 1 {he trigger, but I knew.
FRANK	People only know wh r,y` iV tell them.
JOE SHAYE	Then tell me something. How did you know I wouldn't look in the wallet?
FRANK	The same reason the Yankees always win. Nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes.
JOE SHAYE	The Yankees win because they have Mickey Mantle.
FRANK	I have to go. I'm catching a flight in two hours. Merry Christmas, Joe.
JOE SHAYE	You didn't call to apologize, did you John Doe? Debbie Zane - What do you mean?
JOE SHAYE	You've got no one else to call. Joe hangs up the phone. He cups his hands to his face, then
NEW ACCOUNTS MANAGER	You account balance will be three hundred dolls Mr. Williams. And these are y r emporary checks.
NEW AC	Just take a deposit counter, then fill in ou wish to the amounty I don't need to fill in my account number?
NEW ACCOUNTS MANAGER	At Nevada Savings and Loan, we treat our customers by name instead of by number. Frank walks over and stares at the deposit slips. He grabs A Debbie Zane - 5 When the deposit slips comes through the other side, WE SEE
JOE SHAYE	I'm calling it "The Switch." Next slide. The slide doesn't change. JOE SHAYE (cont'd) John Doe 2172 took two red and fifty deposit slips from Nevada Savings and encoded his account number on the bottom of each one.
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	Wait a second, Joe. Those slips don't even have his name on them.
JOE SHAYE	The bank scanners read the micker ink before they read pen ink. So even though those deposit slips are filled out correctly, each person who made a deposit that day was actually putting money into his account.
SPECIAL AGENT WILKES	How much did he get? Debbie Zane -!
JOE SHAYE	Forty-six thousand, four hundred and' twelve dollars. It was the second largest bank robbery in the history of Las Vegas.
FRANK	What's the fuel consumption of a 707 in flight?
MULLIGAN	Kid, I'm really not in the mood for this today. That damn Skywayman is driving me crazy. There was another article.

UG	Some nut flying posing as a Pan Am has devoted a weekl Frank stares down at the TIMES, h yes wide as he stares
FRANK	The Skywayman...
MULLIGAN	I keep telling them it's not my problem. He doesn't fly on Pan Am planes -- he flies on everybody else. The damn paper is in love with this clown -- they call him the James Bond of the sky.
FRANK	Did you say James Bond? Debbie Zane - 5 Frank is wearing a three button black suit with a sweater
FRANK	And you're sure this is the suit?
SALESMAN	Positive. That'.s the same.one he wore in the movie.
FRANK	Okay. I'll take three.

FOX (CONT'D)	I was looking through the wanted criminal file, and there it was! Look at that! Joe takes the file from Fox and opens it.
JOE SHAYE	The Skywayman. Holy shit, a perfect match. Debbie Zane -
AMDURSKY	They describe The Skywayman as a thirty-year-old -- dark hair --six- feet -- same fucking guy!
JOE SHAYE	It doesn't make any sense. A thirty- year-old has to register for the draft, which means his prints have to be here.
FOX	Maybe there's a reason he didn't register. He could have a wooden leg for all we know. Maybe he was born in Peru and he's not an American
JOE SHAYE	Maybe he's not thirty. Somebody call New York, get a list of juvenile runaways from the NYPD.
JOE SHAYE	Good morning, ma'am, we're the FBI Agents who called.
PAULA	Yes. I've been waiting. I hope you're all hungry. I made biscuits-
PAULA	My husband is a lawyer. Debbie Zane - 5 Paula motions to a FRAMED PICTURE of Jack Wright. He advised me not to speak to you. So I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to him.
JOE SHAYE	Of course, Ma'am. Do you have a current address for your ex-husband, Frank Abagnale?
PAULA	No. He moves around a lot these days. How are those biscuits?
AMDURS KY	Very good.
JOE SHAYE	Ma'am, you filed a police report last year for a juvenile runaway named Frank Ana1e, Jr.
PAULA	He's forging checks? That's why you're here? Half the kids his age are on dope, throwing rocks at police, and you're scaring me to death because my son is forging checks?
JOE SHAYE	What he's doing is a federal offense.
PAULA (CONT'D)	A young boy has to eat, has to have a place to sleep. What do you want him to do? His father can't help him. Paula gets off the couch and grabs her purse. Debbie Zane -'
PAULA (CONT'D)	I'm working part-time now at the Church. Just tell me how much he owes and I'll pay you back. Paula takes out her CHECKBOOK.
JOE SHAYE	So far it's about two million dollars.
LUCY	Yes, Sir, that's him. But I didn't know he was sixteen! I swear to God I didn't know! Joe gets out of the cy , -61oses the door on Lucy and smiles We got him. Frank nervously steps into the NEWSSTAND, hides behind a

FRANK	Every bank uses hand stamps for the dates. They get used over and over, so they're always worn down, and the numbers are always cracking -- the sixes and nines go first. Look at the date on that check -- the ink is worn flat, the nines and sixes are cracking -- that's the stamp of a teller, Joe. Looks like you got yourself an inside job.

FBI DIRECTOR MARSH	How do you know? You haven't looked at it.
FRANK	There's no perforated edge, which means this check was hand cut, not fed. The paper is double bonded, much too heavy for a check. The ink is raised against my fingers instead of flat. Frank brings the check to his nose, sniffs it. Debbie Zane - This doesn't smell like micker. It's' probably drafting ink, the kind you buy at a stationery store. Joe and Director Marsh exchange a look.
FBI DIRECTOR MARSH	Frank, would you be interested in working with the FBI's fraud and counterfeiting unit?
