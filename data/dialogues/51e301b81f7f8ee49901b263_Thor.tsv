CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
JANE	Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
JANE (CONT'D)	Oh-- watch your head.
SELVIG	Thanks. So what's this "anomaly" of yours supposed to look like?
JANE	It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon-- "Racing "round Orion?" I've always said you should have been a poet. Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.
JANE	Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
JANE (CONT'D)	Not until you see it!
SELVIG	I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.
JANE	Thank you.
SELVIG	For what?
JANE	The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
JANE (CONT'D)	It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat.
DARCY (O.S.)	Can I turn on the radio?
JANE	Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, "All agriculture, all the time." Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.
JANE	The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
JANE (CONT'D)	The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
DARCY	Jane? Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
JANE	There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
DARCY	I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment... The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
DARCY (CONT'D)	Jane?
JANE	What?!
DARCY	I think you want to see this. Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT	Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.
JANE	Holy. Shatner.
SELVIG	That's your "subtle" aurora?!
JANE	No-- yes! Let's go!
JANE	Isn't this great?! A thought strikes her.
JANE (CONT'D)	You're seeing it too, right? I'm not crazy?
SELVIG	That's debateable. Put your seat belt on! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A. The SUV lurches.
AN ENORMOUS TORNADO	Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
JANE	You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading. Darcy laughs.
DARCY	Yeah, right! Good one! Oh God, you're serious...
JANE	You want those college credits or not?
DARCY	Keep the credits. I'll intern at Burger King.
JANE	What are you doing?!
DARCY	Saving our lives! Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5. Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
DARCY	I think that was legally your fault.
JANE	Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
JANE (CONT'D)	Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as For a moment, they each forget to breathe. Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR. A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels. --are beautiful.
JANE	--are dilating. That's a good sign.
SELVIG	We still have to get him to a hospital. After we get a reading on the storm?
SELVIG	Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
JANE	Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
HEIMDALL (V.O.)	Questions, they've always asked questions -- this race called man, on this planet they call earth. Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens. We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)	In ages past, they looked to us as gods, for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity. We tried to show them how their world was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil... We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense, ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in a universe of wonder, beauty, and terror that they barely comprehended. We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)	But for all their thirst for knowledge, they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams. Where did he come from? He came from us, the proudest race of warriors the Worlds have ever seen. He came from this -- the greatest Realm the universe has ever known. We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)	He came... from Asgard! We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE
ODIN ALLFATHER	Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
ODIN	Do you think he's ready?
FRIGGA	He thinks he is. He has his father's confidence.
ODIN	He'll need his father's wisdom.
FRIGGA	And his humility? Odin reacts.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)	Thor won't be alone. Loki will be at his side to give him counsel. Have faith in your sons.
ODIN	Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8. Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more. ...if we only had more time.
FRIGGA	For once, our son needs something we cannot provide.
ODIN	I can fight it a little longer...
FRIGGA	No. You've put it off too long! I worry for you. He touches her cheek.
ODIN	I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me?
FRIGGA	Always.
ODIN	Not today. Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king. He pulls her close, and they kiss. Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
THOR	Another! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A. The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by Nervous, brother?
THOR	Have you ever known me to be nervous?
LOKI	There was the time in Nornheim...
THOR	That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive? The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
LOKI	As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.
THOR	Some do battle, others just do tricks. The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
THOR (CONT'D)	Loki... Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
THOR (CONT'D)	Now that was just a waste of good wine.
LOKI	Just a bit of fun. Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED
LOKI (CONT'D)	Nice feathers.
THOR	You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?
LOKI	I was being sincere!
THOR	You're incapable of sincerity.
LOKI	Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.
LOKI (CONT'D)	I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10. Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
THOR	Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:
LOKI	Give us a kiss.
THOR	Stop. Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
THOR (CONT'D)	How do I look?
LOKI	Like a king. They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
LOKI (CONT'D)	It's time.
THOR	You go ahead. Loki casts him a wary look.
THOR (CONT'D)	I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.
FANDRAL	Thank you, love.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)	Now who'd like to polish my sword for me? The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
SIF	I'll miss you.
THE WARRIORS THREE	VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor, 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.
VOLSTAGG	I hope this goes quickly. I'm famished. Noooo!
VOLSTAGG	Are you attached to that pretty face of yours? Because one more word, and you won't be.
FANDRAL	My, we are hungry, aren't we? The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)	Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do it. Even you, Hogun the Grim. Just one smile. Hogun stares at him grimly.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)	All right, half a smile. Look, forget the smile, just show some teeth.
SIF	Fandral, is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge?
FANDRAL	Name it, Lady Sif.
SIF	Keep your mouth shut. A cold BREEZE blows past them.
FRIGGA	It's all right to be nervous.
THOR	Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!
FRIGGA	You may be able to fool the rest of
THOR	...but never you. I know.
FRIGGA	Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had.
THOR	And what is that?
FRIGGA	Me for a mother. She smiles.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)	Now don't keep your father waiting. Frigga leaves. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A. Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
VOLSTAGG	Where is he?
LOKI	He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.
VOLSTAGG	What?
SIF	He wants to make an entrance.
FANDRAL	Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens.
LOKI	I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does. Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
MJOLNIR	Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
SIF	Oh, please. Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display. They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. He raises Gungnir before him.
ODIN	Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born.
ODIN (CONT'D)	So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King. One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them. Now it's their turn to SCREAM.
ODIN	Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
ODIN (CONT'D)	Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?
THOR	I swear.
ODIN	Do you swear to preserve the peace?
THOR	I swear.
ODIN	Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms? Beat.
THOR	I swear.
ODIN	Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE Frost giants... The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor. They've just lost a savage battle. Badly. Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
SIF	The Destroyer. I thought it was but a legend. Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
FANDRAL	I've never been inside the Vault before. It's said the Tesseract was once held here. The Tesseract? I thought that was but a legend too!
SIF	Shush! Odin surveys the destruction.
THOR	The Jotuns must pay for what they've done! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.
ODIN	They have paid with their lives. The Destroyer did its job, and the Casket is safe. All is well.
THOR	"All is well?!" They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these
ODIN	But they didn't.
THOR	I want to know why they-- The Casket of Ancient Winters belonged to the Jotuns. They believe it's their birthright.
THOR	And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!
ODIN	I have a truce with Laufey, the Jotun King.
THOR	He just broke your truce! We must act! Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.
ODIN	Leave us. Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.
ODIN (CONT'D)	And what action would you take?
THOR	March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!
ODIN	You're thinking only as a warrior!
THOR	This was an act of war!
ODIN	It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.
THOR	They got this far!
ODIN	We will find the breach in our defenses. It will be found, and it will be sealed.
THOR	As King of Asgard, I would--
ODIN	You are not King. Not yet. Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far From across the room, Loki watches him.
AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE	Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
SIF	Redecorating, are we? Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.
VOLSTAGG	What's this -- ?!
HOGUN	I told you they'd cancel it.
FANDRAL	We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.
VOLSTAGG	All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart! Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
THOR	It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.
LOKI	Who said I was wise?
THOR	This was to be my day of triumph.
LOKI	It will come. In time. If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything. If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army?
THOR	Yes, exactly!
LOKI	But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
LOKI (CONT'D)	No... stop there! I know that look!
THOR	It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.
LOKI	It's madness!
VOLSTAGG	Madness? What sort of madness?
LOKI	Nothing! Thor was making a jest!
THOR	The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.
FANDRAL	What?!
SIF	Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break. Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.
FANDRAL	This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim.
VOLSTAGG	And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will!
THOR	My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers.
SIF	It is forbidden! Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
THOR	My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral.
THOR (CONT'D)	Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?
FANDRAL	You did. Who led you into the most glorious of battles... ...and to delicacies so succulent, you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?
VOLSTAGG/HOGUN	You did. / You did. He turns to Sif.
THOR	And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?
SIF	I did. True. But I supported you... My friends, trust me now. We must do this. The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
THOR (CONT'D)	Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you? Loki looks startled.
LOKI	What?
THOR	You are coming with me...
LOKI	Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side.
VOLSTAGG	And I.
FANDRAL	And I. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.
HOGUN	And I. The Warriors Three fight together.
SIF	I fear we'll live to regret this.
VOLSTAGG	If we're lucky. Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
THOR	We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.
VOLSTAGG	That will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.
FANDRAL	And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.
VOLSTAGG	Jest not! He heareth all!
FANDRAL	Please. Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose. Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.
VOLSTAGG	Forgive him! He meaneth no offense! Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward. Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
LOKI	Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward.
HEIMDALL	You're not dressed warmly enough. Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.
LOKI	I'm sorry?
HEIMDALL	The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It will kill you all in time, even Thor. You think you can deceive me? I, who watch all? I, who can sense the flapping of a butterfly's wings a thousand worlds away? He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.
HEIMDALL (CONT'D)	Or can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim? Fandral looks gob-smacked.
FANDRAL	That was just a bit of a jest, really... Loki goes into damage control.
LOKI	You must be mistaken. We're not-- Enough. Heimdall, may we pass? Heimdall stares him down.
HEIMDALL	For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened.
THOR	Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
VOLSTAGG	What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?
LOKI	Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
HEIMDALL	Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim.
THOR	I have no plans to die today.
HEIMDALL	None do. Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
HEIMDALL	All is ready. You may pass.
VOLSTAGG	Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?
HEIMDALL	To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.
VOLSTAGG	Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.
THOR	Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
THOR	Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
VOLSTAGG	This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!
FANDRAL	You bathe? Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
HOGUN	We shouldn't be here.
THOR	Too late now.
FANDRAL	Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice. Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.
LOKI	Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.
THOR	For what?
LOKI	To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.
VOLSTAGG	I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part.
THOR	We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.
SIF	He's just got to swing his hammer...
THOR	It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?
FANDRAL	Adventuring? Is that what we're doing?
THOR	What would you call it?
FANDRAL	Freezing.
VOLSTAGG	Starving.
SIF	Whining.
THOR	How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan.
HOGUN	No, not that! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.
SIF	Please don't make us sing again!
FANDRAL	If I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword!
SIF	Well, now I'm on board. She and Thor share a grin. The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
SIF (CONT'D)	Where are they?
THOR	Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
JOTUN SENTRY	What is your business here, Asgardian? The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.
THOR	I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers. Then speak. Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
LAUFEY	I am Laufey, King of this Realm.
THOR	And I am--
LAUFEY	We know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world?
THOR	I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.
LAUFEY	You "demand?"
THOR	How did your people get into Asgard?
LAUFEY	The house of Odin is full of traitors. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
THOR	Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.
LAUFEY	Your father is a murderer and a thief. He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins. We have the right to reclaim the Casket.
THOR	Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.
LAUFEY	And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.
THOR	This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
LOKI	Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.
THOR	Know your place, brother...
LAUFEY	You should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash. Laufey steps out of the shadows.
LAUFEY (CONT'D)	But I do. Go now, while I still allow it. Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.
LOKI	We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
JOTUN	Run back home, little princess. Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
LOKI	Damn. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
VOLSTAGG	Silly hammer! Has a mind of its own! ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
FANDRAL	I'm hoping that's just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
THOR	Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.
FANDRAL	Well? What move, do you think?
VOLSTAGG	I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."
FANDRAL	At this close range? I think "The Alfheim Lunge" is a better move. Maybe if they were three feet tall! No! How about "The Randy Valkyrie"? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.
HOGUN	Shut up! Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
SIF	If you don't treat me like a lady, I won't act like a lady! She takes out the Jotun. Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
LOKI	Pathetic. He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
THOR	Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
THOR (CONT'D)	Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
THOR (CONT'D)	Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
SIF	I'm so glad I taught him how to do that! Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
VOLSTAGG	You may want to put some ice on that! The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)	You may be taller, but I'm wider! Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and It's not too late for you to surrender. Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells Don't let them grab hold of you! He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)	Thank you, my lady. But I nearly had him!
SIF	Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29. A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
VOLSTAGG	Hang on! Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
HOGUN	Watch the legs! Right. Sorry. Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.
FANDRAL	You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade Fair enough. Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
FANDRAL (CONT'D)	Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword? Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.
VOLSTAGG	That's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade.
FANDRAL	I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it?
VOLSTAGG	Just try not to bleed.
FANDRAL	How's the face?
VOLSTAGG	Flawless. Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
THOR	Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
LOKI	That can't be good.
VOLSTAGG	Yes, it could! Might be an early spring! They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
LOKI	Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
THOR	Then go!
SIF	There are too many of them!
THOR	I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
SIF	Thor! But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.
VOLSTAGG	Run! Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
THOR'S FIST	Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)	What's Thor done?
LOKI	Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
THOR	Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. Actually, could you bring the mists back, please? Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
ODIN ALLFATHER	Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
ODIN	Laufey. End this.
LAUFEY	Your boy sought this out.
ODIN	You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
LAUFEY	We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined.
ODIN	So be it. Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
THOR	Now! We'll finish them together!
ODIN	Silence! Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
THOR	Why did you bring us back?
ODIN	Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?
THOR	I was protecting my home.
ODIN	You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom? Odin turns to the others. Get him to the healing room! Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
THOR	There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him.
THOR (CONT'D)	Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt.
ODIN	That's pride and vanity that talks! Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? What of a warrior's patience, cunning?
THOR	While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!
ODIN	You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
THOR	And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
ODIN	A fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready. Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly. Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.
ODIN	Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control You are unworthy of this Realm... Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.
ODIN (CONT'D)	...unworthy of your title... He rips away Thor's cloak.
ODIN (CONT'D)	...unworthy of the loved ones you've betrayed. I hereby take from you your powers. Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
ODIN (CONT'D)	In the name of my father... A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
ODIN (CONT'D)	...and of his father before... Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
ODIN (CONT'D)	I cast you out! Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its After a beat, we hear familiar voices.
DARCY (V.O.)	I think that was legally your fault.
JANE (V.O.)	Get the first aid kit. Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me.
THOR'S POV	Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him, Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR. Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
JANE (CONT'D)	Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground.
THOR	Hammer...
DARCY	Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious. Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
JANE	Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible We've got to move fast before anything changes.
JANE (CONT'D)	We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
SELVIG	Jane, we need get him to a hospital. Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
JANE	Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain. Look at him, he's fine. Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.
THOR	Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!
JANE	Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here.
SELVIG	You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated.
THOR	You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.
SELVIG	It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
THOR	Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
JANE	Erik, just back away...
SELVIG	You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.
THOR	What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?
DARCY	Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
THOR	You dare threaten Thor with so puny Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
DARCY	What? He was freaking me out. Next time you decide to taser someone, do me a favor and make sure they're already inside the truck. Jane, come on... Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.
ADMISSIONS NURSE	Name?
JANE	He said it was "Thor." The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key T-H-O-R. And your relationship to him?
JANE	I've never met him before.
DARCY	Until she hit him with the car.
JANE	Grazed him, actually. Oh, and we tasered him, too. Must have been quite the spat.
JANE	I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay.
ADMISSIONS NURSE	I'm going to need a name and contact number.
JANE	Jane Foster.
SELVIG	Oh, for God's sake... He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
SELVIG (CONT'D)	Here. Let's go. Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.
NURSE	Hi. Just taking a little blood. Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.
THOR	How dare you attack the son of Odin!
NURSE	I need some help! Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.
NURSE (CONT'D)	We're trying to help you!
THOR	Then bring me a healing stone, you savages! He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
ORDERLY	What the hell is this guy on? Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
THOR	You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.
TOWNIE	Huh. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A. The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
TOWNIE (CONT'D)	Huh.
JANE	Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me.
SELVIG	We might want to perform a spectral analysis.
JANE	"We?"
SELVIG	I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
JANE	You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?
SELVIG	She was more than a friend.
JANE	Could you call in a favor?
SELVIG	You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?
JANE	If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event.
SELVIG	Meaning? Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.
JANE	Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.
SELVIG	How "big" are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
JANE	I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
DARCY	A what?
SELVIG	I thought you were a science major.
DARCY	Political Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.
JANE	She was the only applicant. An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a "theoretical" connection between two different points of space-time. Darcy stares blankly. A wormhole. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B. Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the Erik, look... Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen What do you see here?
SELVIG	Stars.
JANE	Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
JANE (CONT'D)	This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
DARCY	Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.
SELVIG	Is that...?
JANE	I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
FRIGGA	How could you have done this?
ODIN	Do you understand what he set in motion? He's taken us to the brink of war!
FRIGGA	But banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son!
ODIN	What would you have done?
FRIGGA	I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty!
ODIN	That is why I'm King. I, too, grieve the loss of our son. But there are some things that even I cannot undo.
FRIGGA	You can bring him back.
ODIN	No. His fate is in his own hands now.
THOR	It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
ADMISSIONS NURSE	I'm sorry, only relatives can visit patients. But... I'm his wife. Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.
ADMISSIONS NURSE	I thought you said you didn't know him. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.
JANE	I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?
ADMISSIONS NURSE	None of us, dear. He's in Room They enter Thor's room.
JANE	Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.
DARCY	So now what?
JANE	We find him.
SELVIG	Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea.
JANE	I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice.
DARCY	Oo-kay. She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.
SELVIG	So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?
JANE	However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --
BAM!	She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
JANE	I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose. Thor looks up at the sky.
THOR	Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?
DARCY	I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many. Let's get you some clothes. Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
VOLSTAGG	We should never have let him go.
SIF	There was no stopping him.
FANDRAL	At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.
VOLSTAGG	How did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm.
LOKI	I told him. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.
FANDRAL	What?
LOKI	I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.
VOLSTAGG	You told the guard?
LOKI	I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
SIF	Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind!
LOKI	And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
SIF	He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.
VOLSTAGG	True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives.
HOGUN	Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.
FANDRAL	Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?
HOGUN	A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.
VOLSTAGG	No! Surely not!
FANDRAL	Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.
SIF	Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?
VOLSTAGG	The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.
SIF	We should go to the Allfather.
FANDRAL	And tell him what? "Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!"
SIF	It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger. He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
ODIN (O.S.)	Stop! Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
LOKI	Am I cursed?
ODIN	No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
LOKI	What am I?
ODIN	You're my son.
LOKI	What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
LOKI (CONT'D)	The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.
ODIN	No. In the aftermath of the battle, I went into the Temple, and I found a baby. Small for a giant's offspring -- abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufey's son. Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.
LOKI	Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.
LOKI (CONT'D)	Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?
ODIN	You were an innocent child.
LOKI	You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer. Tell me!
ODIN	I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace... through you. But those plans no longer matter.
LOKI	So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.
ODIN	Why do you twist my words?
LOKI	You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?
ODIN	You are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.
LOKI	Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?
ODIN	Don't...
LOKI	It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.
ODIN	Listen... 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48B.
LOKI	Because no matter how much you claim to "love" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
ODIN	Listen to me! Loki strides away towards the exit.
ODIN (CONT'D)	Loki! Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
LOKI	Guards! They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
EAGER TOWNIE	This'll do it. He yells to the driver.
EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)	Okay, let 'er rip! The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then People dive out of the way. The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN" He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object Sir -- we've found it. Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
DARCY	You know, for a crazy homeless guy, he's pretty cut. Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a Hey, sorry I tased you! Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
JANE	Excuse me... excuse me! She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
JANE (CONT'D)	My ex. Thor stares at her a beat.
JANE (CONT'D)	They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry.
THOR	They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
JANE	You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive.
THOR	What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
SELVIG	The Bifrost... Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
JANE	What exactly is the Bifrost? This mortal form has grown weak.
JANE (CONT'D)	Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.
FRIGGA	I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family.
LOKI	So why did he lie?
FRIGGA	He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that. Loki takes this in, stares at Odin. You can speak to him. He can see and hear us, even now.
LOKI	How long will it last?
FRIGGA	I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared.
LOKI	I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.
FRIGGA	But he's put it off for so long now, I fear... Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
FRIGGA (CONT'D)	You're a good son. Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
FRIGGA (CONT'D)	We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother. Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.
LOKI	What hope is there for Thor?
FRIGGA	There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home. Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
THE EINHERJAR GUARD	Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
FRIGGA (CONT'D)	Thor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours. The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
FRIGGA (CONT'D)	Make your father proud. Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
JANE	Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
JANE (CONT'D)	Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.
DARCY	And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry. Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
THOR	This drink. I like it.
DARCY	Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town. Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it. Another! ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
JANE	Sorry, Izzy. Little accident. Yo voy a pagar la taza. Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in Did you see that? The first time she brings a man in here, and he's a lunatic!
JANE	What was that? He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.
THOR	It was delicious. I want another.
JANE	Then you should just say so!
THOR	I just did.
JANE	I mean ask for it. Nicely.
THOR	I meant no disrespect.
JANE	All right, then no more smashing, deal?
THOR	You have my word.
JANE	Good. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55. A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
ISABELA	Morning, Pete. Jake.
TOWNIE PETE	The usual, please, Izzy. Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE	You missed all the excitement out at the crater.
ISABELA	What crater? Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
TOWNIE PETE	They're saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE	We were having a good time with it till the Feds showed up, chased us out.
JANE	Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE	Yep. They said it was radioactive. And I had my hands all over it. I'm probably sterile now. Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
DARCY	Oh my God, this is going on Facebook. Darcy whips out her cellphone. Smile! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A.
SELVIG	What did the satellite look like?
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE	I don't know nothing about satellites. But it was heavy. Real heavy. Nobody could lift it. This gets Thor's attention. Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
THOR	Where?!
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE	About twelve miles east of here. Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
PETE	I wouldn't bother! Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left!
JANE	Where are you going?
THOR	Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
JANE	Why?
THOR	To get what belongs to me.
JANE	So now you own a satellite?
THOR	It's not what they say it is.
JANE	Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it?
THOR	Yes. He stops walking.
THOR (CONT'D)	If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.
JANE	Everything?
THOR	All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others.
DARCY	"Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?" Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,
SELVIG	Jane. He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much Please don't do this.
JANE	You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.
SELVIG	I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.
JANE	He's promised us answers.
SELVIG	He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost." "Mjolnir." These are the stories I grew up with as a child!
JANE	I'd just be driving him out there, that's all.
SELVIG	It's dangerous. He's dangerous. After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
JANE	I'm sorry. I can't take you.
THOR	I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it.
JANE	That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them.
THOR	Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.
SELVIG	Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
SIF	Allfather, we must speak with you But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --
LOKI	Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
VOLSTAGG	What is this?
LOKI	My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.
FANDRAL	Where is Odin?
LOKI	Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.
SIF	We would speak with her. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.
LOKI	She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your "urgent" matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly.
SIF	We would ask you to end Thor's banishment.
LOKI	My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
LOKI (CONT'D)	All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.
FANDRAL	Of course. Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
JANE	Hey! That's my stuff!
JANE	What the hell is going on here?! The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.
COULSON	Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with
SHIELD.	Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.
JANE	I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!
SELVIG	Jane. This is more serious than you realize. Let it go.
JANE	Let it go?! This is my life!
COULSON	We're here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data.
JANE	By "appropriate" you mean "steal?" Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.
COULSON	This should more than compensate you for your trouble. She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.
JANE	I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!
COULSON	Then I'm sure you can do it again.
JANE	And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!
COULSON	We're the good guys, Ms. Foster. He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
JANE	So are we! We're on the verge of
UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING	extraordinary. Jane holds up her notebook. Everything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me. Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
COULSON	Thank you for your cooperation. He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.
JANE	Years of research, gone.
DARCY	They even took my iPod.
SELVIG	And your back-ups?
JANE	Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.
DARCY	I just downloaded, like, thirty songs on there. Will you please stop talking about your iPod?! Who are these people?
SELVIG	No one knows much about them. But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again.
JANE	I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.
SELVIG	Please, let me contact one of my colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people. I'll e- mail him and see if he can help.
DARCY	They took your laptop, too. Annoyed, Selvig thinks.
SELVIG	I'll just be a minute. He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
THOR	I need a horse.
PET STORE CLERK	Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just dogs, cats, birds.
THOR	Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
JANE	You still want a lift? "And though they're large, giants can be quiet. You have to listen carefully for the sound of their footsteps -- because they may be closer than you think." Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)	Joshua, come sit down. It's story time. The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to He eyes the illustration, pondering.
JANE	I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement.
THOR	Many times. You're brave to do it.
JANE	They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.
THOR	But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.
JANE	"This Realm?" Why do you talk like that?
THOR	You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself.
JANE	Yeah. Just a little.
THOR	Good strange or bad strange?
JANE	I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
JANE (CONT'D)	Sorry. She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.
JANE (CONT'D)	Who are you? Really?
THOR	You'll see soon enough.
JANE	You promised me answers. Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.
THOR	What you seek -- it's a bridge.
JANE	A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
THOR	More like a rainbow bridge. A beat.
JANE	God, I hope you're not crazy.
A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE	Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers, Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
JANE	That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.
THOR	You're going to need this.
JANE	Why?-- Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
THOR	Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.	He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his Deal?
JANE	No! Look what's down there! You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out!
THOR	No. Jane looks relieved.
THOR (CONT'D)	I'm going to fly out. Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
JANE	Wait... But Thor is already headed towards the crater.
TECHIE	Feed from the keyhole. Can barely penetrate the cloud cover. The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
TECHIE (CONT'D)	Tech's barely working as it is, with all the interference that thing's giving off. He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.
TECHIE (CONT'D)	Hey, we've got a commercial aircraft coming in right over us, Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.
SITWELL	Reroute it, like all the others.
TECHIE	Right. Can I get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble? Sitwell glares at him. It'd be a nice gesture. The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
TECHIE (CONT'D)	Hold a sec... we got something outside the fence, west side... He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a

SHIELD AGENT	Agents down! We've got a perimeter breach! On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
SITWELL	Get Coulson. Sitwell punches an alarm.
SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)	You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message. His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.
JANE	Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.
JANE (CONT'D)	But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She hangs up. Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He Coulson activates his radio.
COULSON	I want eyes up high. With a gun. Now! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67B. A SNIPER, dressed in black tactical gear and high-tech His name is BARTON. Lightning CRACKLES around the camp. Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
COULSON	Barton. Talk to me. One shot, one kill, sir. Just give the word.
BARTON'S NIGHTVISION POV	Overlooking the complex. It's a clear field of vision,
BARTON (CONT'D)	Hello, handsome. As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
A HUGE SHIELD AGENT	The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
THOR	You're big. Thor grins. Fought bigger.
JANE	No... Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward, Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge Thor races back towards the structure. He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth. Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel, As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
COULSON	Barton...
COULSON (V.O., ON RADIO)	...hold your fire. Barton releases the trigger, pulls up. Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing Coulson looks on, disappointed. SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
COULSON	Ground units, move in. Show's over. As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him.
JANE	I can't just leave him there.
SELVIG	Why not?
JANE	You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.
DARCY	Hey! Myeu-muh! Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig Where did you find this? Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.
SELVIG	In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was. Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.
JANE	Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities?
SELVIG	I was talking about science, not magic!
JANE	Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.
SELVIG	Who wrote science fiction.
JANE	The precursor of science fact.
SELVIG	In some cases.
JANE	If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side.
JANE (CONT'D)	Advanced beings could have come through it before.
SELVIG	Jane...
DARCY	A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities. They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly
JANE	Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams.
SELVIG	Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time.
DARCY	I'll help you. Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no
COULSON	It's not easy to do what you did. You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops. That's hurtful. The men you so easily subdued are highly-trained professionals, and in my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them. Would you like to tell me where you received your training? Thor sits silently.
COULSON (CONT'D)	Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? Then again, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. What was it, South Africa? Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.
COULSON (CONT'D)	Certain groups pay well for a good mercenary. Especially HYDRA. Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.
COULSON (CONT'D)	Who are you? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72.
THOR	Just a man.
COULSON	One way or another, we find out what we want to know. We're good at that. Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.
LOKI (O.S.)	I thought he'd never leave. Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
THOR	Loki? What are you doing here?
LOKI	I had to see you.
THOR	What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to
LOKI	Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned.
THOR	What?
LOKI	Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
LOKI (CONT'D)	You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. It was cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing you could never lift it. Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.
LOKI (CONT'D)	The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.
THOR	Can I come home?
LOKI	The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
THOR	But couldn't we find a way to--
LOKI	Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.
LOKI (CONT'D)	This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.
THOR	No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here.
LOKI	Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.
LOKI (CONT'D)	Fare well, brother.
THOR	Good-bye.
COULSON	Good-bye? I just got back. Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.
COULSON (CONT'D)	Now. Where did we leave off? He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it Sir... he's got a visitor.
COULSON	"Donald Blake?"
SELVIG	Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of our team.
COULSON	You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.
SELVIG	Troubled, not dangerous. He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. It was years of his life, gone! He got depressed, started drinking, and... well, you know the rest.
COULSON	Uh-huh. You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity?
SELVIG	Certainly. The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.
SELVIG (CONT'D)	You can understand how a man could go off like that. I mean, a big, faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property... ...is how he described it.
COULSON	That doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security. Selvig shrugs.
SELVIG	Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A. On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
COULSON	It says here he's an M.D.
SELVIG	He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really. If you would just release him to me, I promise to keep an eye on him. Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
COULSON	Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here. The Techie looks to him, surprised. Make sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again. Selvig shakes his hand.
SELVIG	Thank you.
SELVIG	Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are! Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
SELVIG (CONT'D)	It's going to be all right, my friend. Come on, I'm taking you home. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A. He leads the bewildered Thor out the door. He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
COULSON	Just keep him away from the bars.
SELVIG	I will! Where are we going? Selvig drops his cool demeanor.
SELVIG	To get a drink. Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
COULSON	Follow them.
LAUFEY	Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
LOKI	I've come alone and unarmed.
LAUFEY	To what end?
LOKI	To make you another proposition. So you're the one who let us into Asgard.
LOKI	You're welcome.
LAUFEY	My men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
LOKI	You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
LOKI (CONT'D)	Hello, Father. Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
LAUFEY	Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin had killed you. That's what I would have done. He's as weak as you are.
LOKI	No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause.
LAUFEY	Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made. I will hear you.
LOKI	I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket. Laufey studies Loki's face.
LAUFEY	Why would you do this?
LOKI	When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.
LAUFEY	This is a great day for Jotunheim. Asgard is finally ours.
LOKI	No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.
LAUFEY	I accept. Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
LOKI	What troubles you, Gatekeeper?
HEIMDALL	I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm.
LOKI	Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
HEIMDALL	Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see. Loki sizes him up, smiles.
LOKI	You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?
HEIMDALL	No.
LOKI	And why is that?
HEIMDALL	Because he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him.
LOKI	Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.
HEIMDALL	Yes.
LOKI	Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A.
SELVIG	Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker.
THOR	Thank you for what you've done.
SELVIG	Don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.
THOR	Are you in love with her?
SELVIG	Of course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together. A good man, but he never listened. This registers with Thor.
THOR	Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest.
SELVIG	I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you.
THOR	I swear to you, I mean her no harm.
SELVIG	Good. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight. A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.
THOR	I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
SELVIG	It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions. Thor takes this in.
THOR	For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
SELVIG	Anyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are. Thor nods. Hey, I know you, man... An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)	You were in the diner with that hot girl. Thor doesn't like where this is going.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)	I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me. He laughs. Thor is annoyed.
THOR	I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.
DRUNK TOWNIE	And you should shut the hell up, princess. Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it.
THOR	I will not fight him.
DRUNK TOWNIE	Then it'll be easy to kick your ass. Selvig stands, steps between the two men.
SELVIG	Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads. Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Another drink? "The mood is good, our hearts are full, there's magic in the air. / It's all because we're here tonight, and haven't got a care. / So raise a glass, and toast to life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed!" Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap. WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell, She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
THOR	Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
JANE	Erik! Is he all right?
THOR	He's fine. Not injured at all. As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
THOR (CONT'D)	Sorry, my friend.
JANE	What happened?
THOR	We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.
JANE	Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
SELVIG	I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder. But you ought to be. Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
THOR	These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
JANE	Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from Can we go outside?
JANE	I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy. I come up here a lot, now that I think about it. Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.
JANE (CONT'D)	I'm glad you're safe.
THOR	You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.
JANE	I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.
THOR	It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.
JANE	No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch... She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
THOR	What's wrong?
JANE	SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day.
THOR	You must do this. You must finish what you've started.
JANE	Why?
THOR	Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are. Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
JANE	What is it?
THOR	This is how my father explained it to me... Your world is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now, you see it every day, without realizing. Images glimpsed through -- what did you call it?... ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine Realms... They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
FANDRAL	Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
VOLSTAGG	Do not mistake my appetite for apathy.
SIF	Stop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it! We must go. We must find Thor. Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
FANDRAL	It's treason, Hogun.
VOLSTAGG	To hell with treason, it's suicide. Now, shh! Heimdall may be watching! It's said he can hear--
FANDRAL	Yes, yes, we know!
SIF	Thor would do the same for us. An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.
EINHERJAR GUARD	Heimdall demands your presence. Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.
VOLSTAGG	We're doomed. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84A. He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.
SELVIG	I need some coffee. The three head inside Smith Motors.
DARCY	Thanks.
THOR	You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
AGENT GARRETT	They want an update.
AGENT CALE	Tell them he's eating eggs.
AGENT GARRETT	Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at him. Target is eating eggs, sir. We'll keep you posted. May I have this?
DARCY	Sure.
THOR	Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves.
THOR	To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior. She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.
ISABEL	Okay. Thank you.
THOR	If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your "coffee."
ISABEL	Any time. He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and She could do worse.
VOLSTAGG	Good Heimdall, less us explain--
HEIMDALL	You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances.
SIF	Yes, but--
HEIMDALL	Good. The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?
VOLSTAGG	So you'll help us?
HEIMDALL	I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you. With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
FANDRAL	Complicated fellow, isn't he?
VOLSTAGG	Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.
SIF	Look! The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
COULSON	What the hell was that?
TECHIE	I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest.
COULSON	Let's go take a look.
VOLSTAGG	He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.
FANDRAL	The winds would have blown them away by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.
SIF	Or we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
FANDRAL	It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town. Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He
VOLSTAGG	There you go, lad! The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head Is it just me, or does Earth look a little different to you?
SIF	It has been a thousand years...
VOLSTAGG	Things change so fast here. You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone. Volstagg sniffs, smells something.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)	Perhaps we should split up. Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
AGENT GARRETT	Is there a Renaissance Faire in town?
AGENT CALE	Call it in. But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
VOLSTAGG	Never cared for spies. He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)	Exquisite.
EINHERJAR GUARD	My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing. Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.
HEIMDALL	Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?
LOKI	You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King. And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper. And you are no longer a citizen of Asgard.
HEIMDALL	Then I need no longer obey you. Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
LOKI	Ensure my brother does not return. The door opens.
VOLSTAGG (O.S.)	Found you! Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --
SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE	Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.
THOR	My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
SELVIG	I don't believe it...
DARCY	Who are they?
VOLSTAGG	Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)	Well, perhaps I've put on a little more muscle since I was here last.
JANE	That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe?
VOLSTAGG	Exactly! Those lovely herring people. They worshipped us! Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.
THOR	My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come.
FANDRAL	We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.
THOR	You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.
SIF	Thor... your father still lives. Thor reacts to the revelation. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 92.
COULSON	Get somebody from Linguistics out here. Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.
DARCY	Was somebody else coming? Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground. Is that one of Stark's?
COULSON	I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything. Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the Hello! You're using unregistered weapons technology. Please identify yourself. We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up
COULSON (CONT'D)	Incoming! As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
THOR	Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.
JANE	What about you?
THOR	I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor.
THOR (CONT'D)	I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side.
VOLSTAGG	You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed!
FANDRAL	Or one of us, trying to protect you. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 94.
SIF	The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us. Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the You're right. Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
THOR (CONT'D)	Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of
LOKI	Father. Welcome to Asgard.
THE DESTROYER	Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting
SIF	Keep him distracted. She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the
FANDRAL	What do you think? "The Svartalfheim Twist?" "Kiss of the Hag?" "Face Full of Boot?" Volstagg grins eagerly.
VOLSTAGG	"The Flying Mountain." Hogun and Fandral groan.
FANDRAL	Not "The Flying Mountain!" It threw out my back for a year last time!
VOLSTAGG	Trust me, it'll work. My friends fight bravely, but they won't be able to hold it back much longer. Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many
DOWN THE STREET	Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as Come on! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A. Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
VOLSTAGG	For Asgaaaaard!!! The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
SIF	Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
JANE	Erik! She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going Go! Leave me! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98. Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
THOR	Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
JANE	What are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
SELVIG	I'm really starting to like him. Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.
THOR	Go, while you can!
SIF	But the others...
THOR	You can't help them now. Your job is to survive. She struggles to sit up.
SIF	No! I will die a warrior's death. Stories will be told of this day-- He gently takes her shield from her.
THOR	Live and tell those stories yourself. At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to Get him out of here!
FANDRAL	No. We can still fight!
THOR	But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins.
THOR (CONT'D)	Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
THOR (CONT'D)	Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer.
THOR (CONT'D)	Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard. Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms. Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
SELVIG	Jane, no! He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek. Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
JANE	Oh. My. God.
THE MIGHTY THOR	Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
KRAKABOOM!	Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate, Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
COULSON	Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me.
DARCY	So, how can you speak our language?
VOLSTAGG	Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours. Thor calls up to the sky.
THOR	Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!
THOR	He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.
VOLSTAGG	Then we're trapped here forever.
FANDRAL	Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)	Are all earth maidens as fair as you? Darcy enjoys the attention.
DARCY	No. Thor shouts back up to the sky.
THOR	Heimdall!
VOLSTAGG	Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose. Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
FANDRAL	Sorry, my love. These things happen. 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103. He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
THOR	Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally. If you return the items you have stolen from Jane Foster.
COULSON	Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.
COULSON (CONT'D)	You'll get your equipment back. You're going to need it to continue your research... which, after today's events, SHIELD would like to fully sponsor. If that's all right with you. Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at

THOR	Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me. Thor bolts out the door. A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard, Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed. He forms an ICE BLADE.
LAUFEY	It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey. He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

LOKI (CONT'D)	And I will make you proud. Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
FRIGGA	Thor! She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
LOKI	Found its way back to you, did it?
THOR	No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.
FRIGGA	What?
THOR	Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.
LOKI	It must have been enforcing Father's last command.
THOR	You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been. It's good to have you back. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to destroy Jotunheim. Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
THOR	Jotunheim... He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an

LOKI (CONT'D)	You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.
THOR	Why have you done this?
LOKI	To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.
THOR	He won't! You can't kill an entire race!
LOKI	What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.
THOR	I've changed.
LOKI	Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
LOKI (CONT'D)	Fight me. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
THOR	Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?
LOKI	I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108. With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
THOR	I will not fight you, brother.
LOKI	I am not your brother. I never was.
THOR	Loki, this is madness... Loki grins.
LOKI	Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman. Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.
LOKI (CONT'D)	It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself. That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and

JANE	Something's wrong. The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
LOKI	If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.

He looks Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing Loki watches him smugly.
LOKI	Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
LOKI (CONT'D)	Stop! What are you doing?! Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!

ODIN	It is over. Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
JANE	It's gone.
VOLSTAGG	...and then, with a mighty bellow, I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low...
FANDRAL	Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--
VOLSTAGG	As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security!
FANDRAL	Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun points to Volstagg.
HOGUN	Big stomach. Big mouth. The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
FANDRAL	Well, how about that? A smile! I'd say that calls for another drink! They laugh and raise another round. Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
SIF	My Queen. I am so sorry for your loss. Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.
FRIGGA	Thank you, Sif. She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
FRIGGA (CONT'D)	How is he? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.

SIF	I will always be at his side. Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.
ODIN	You'll be a wise King.
THOR	There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father. I have much to learn. I know that now. But some day, perhaps, I will make you proud.
ODIN	You've already made me proud. Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words. Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
THOR	Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.
HEIMDALL	Yes.
