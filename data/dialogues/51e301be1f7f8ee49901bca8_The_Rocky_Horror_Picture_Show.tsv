RALPH	Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!
BRAD	Well I don't think there was any doubt about that - You and Betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.
RALPH	Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place. Science was never one of my favourite subjects but I sure with Dr Scott could have made it today.
BRAD	Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him. We drove over to see him last vacation. It's a shame his new job took him away from Denton.
RALPH	Hey fella. It looks like it could be your turn next.
BRAD	Who knows...ha ha. Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful. Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Monroe. Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt. Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a lucky guy. (They start to move d.s.)
JANET	Yes.
BRAD	Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
JANET	Yes.
BRAD	And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
JANET	Yes. Hey Janet.
JANET	Yes Brad.
BRAD	I've got something to say.
JANET	Uh huh.
BRAD	I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.

JANET	Oh Brad, I'm mad.
BRAD	Dammit, Janet.
BRAD, JANET, FAMILY.	I love you.
NARRATOR	I would like if I may to take you on a strange journey.
NARRATOR	It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them. It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving. It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air. But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening.
NARRATOR	It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time.
JANET	Gosh. That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us. They certainly take their lives in their hands. What with the weather and all.
BRAD	Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type.
JANET	What's the matter Brad, darling?
BRAD	I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
JANET	Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
BRAD	Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
JANET	What was that bang?
BRAD	We must have a blow-out.
JANET	Oh...
BRAD	You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
JANET	But where will you go? We're in the middle of nowhere.
BRAD	Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles? Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
JANET	I'm coming with you.
BRAD	There's no point both of us getting wet.
JANET	I'm coming with you. Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
JANET	In the velvet darkness Of the blackest night Burning bright.
JANET	There's a guiding star No matter what or who you are.
BRAD & JANET	There's a light
PHANTOM VOICES	Over at the Frankenstein place.
BRAD	There's a light.
PHANTOM VOICES	Burning in the fireplace.
JANET	There's a light, a light In the darkness of everybody's life
BRAD	I can see the flag fly I can see the rain Just the same There has got to be Something better here For you and me.
BRAD & JANET	There's a light.
PHANTOM VOICES	Burning in the fireplace.
BRAD	There's a light.
BRAD	A light In the darkness of everybody's life.
RIFF RAFF	The darkness must go Down the river of nights dreaming Flow morphia slow Let the sun and light come streaming Into my life.
RIFF RAFF	Into my life.
BRAD & JANET	There's a light.
PHANTOM VOICES	Over at the Frankenstein place.
BRAD & JANET	There's a light.
PHANTOM VOICES	Burning in the fireplace.
PHANTOM VOICES	There's a light, a light.
BRAD & JANET	In the darkness of everybody's life.
NARRATOR	And so it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet and that they had found the assistance that their plight required - or had they?
JANET	Oh, Brad. Let's go back. I'm cold and I'm frightened.
BRAD	Just a moment, Janet. They may have a telephone.
RIFF RAFF	Hello.
BRAD	Uh - oh - Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. I - ah - wondered if you could help us. Our car has broken down about two miles up the road. Do you have a phone we might use?
RIFF RAFF	You're wet.
JANET	Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
BRAD	Yes.
RIFF RAFF	Yes.
RIFF RAFF	I think you had better both come inside.
JANET	You're too kind.
JANET	Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of place is this?
BRAD	Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
RIFF RAFF	This way.
JANET	Are you - giving a party?
RIFF RAFF	No. You've arrived on a rather special night. It's one of the master's affairs.
JANET	Oh, lucky him.
MAGENTA	He's lucky.
MAGENTA	You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky.
RIFF RAFF	It's astounding Time is fleeting But listen closely Not for very much longer I've got to keep control.
RIFF RAFF	I remember doing the Time Warp.
RIFF RAFF	Drinking those moments when The blackness would hit me.
RIFF RAFF	And the void would be calling.
GUESTS	Let's do the Time Warp again.
GUESTS	Let's do the Time Warp again.
NARRATOR	It's just a jump to the left.
GUESTS	And a step to the right - right - right - right - right.
NARRATOR	With your hands on your hips.
GUESTS	You bring your knees in tight. But it's the pelvic thrust. They really drive you insane.
GUESTS (Cont)	Let's do the Time Warp again.
GUESTS	Let's do the Time Warp again.
MAGENTA	It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No not at all.
In another dimension.	With voyeuristic intention. With a bit of a mind flip You're into the time slip Nothing will ever seem the same.
GUESTS	Let's do the Time Warp again.
GUESTS	Let's do the Time Warp again.
COLUMBIA	Well I was walking down the street Just having a think When a snake of a guy Gave me an evil wink. Well it shook me up It took me by surprise He had a pick-up truck And the devil's eyes He stared at me And I felt a change Time meant nothing Never would again.
GUESTS	Let's do the Time Warp again.
GUESTS	Let's do the Time Warp again.
NARRATOR	It's just a jump to the left.
GUESTS	And then a step to the right.
NARRATOR	With your hands on your hips.
GUESTS	You bring your knees in tight. Let's do the Time Warp again.
JANET	Oh....Say something.
BRAD	Say! Do any of you guys know the Madison?
JANET	Brad, please lets get out of here.
BRAD	For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
JANET	But it seems so unhealthy here.
BRAD	It's just a..a party Janet.
JANET	Well I want to leave.
BRAD	We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
JANET	Then ask the butler - or someone.
BRAD	Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
JANET	This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
BRAD	They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own. - They may do some more folk dancing.
JANET	Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
BRAD	I'm here, there's nothing to worry about. TO COLOUR AT BEGINNING OF FOLLOWING SCENE
FRANK	How do you do. He's a little brought down - Because when you knocked He thought you were the candyman.
FRANK	Don't get strung out by the way that I look.
FRANK	Don't judge a book by its cover I'm not much of a man By the light of day But by night I'm one hell of a lover.
FRANK	I'm just a sweet Transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.
Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound	You look like you're both pretty groovie.
Or if you want something visual	not too abysmal We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.
BRAD	I'm glad we caught you at home Ah - could we use your phone We're both in a bit of a hurry.
JANET	Right!
BRAD	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
FRANK	You got caught with a flat Well how about that Well babies don't you panic By the light of the night It'll seem alright I'll get you a satanic mechanic.
FRANK	I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.
FRANK	Why dont'cha stay for the night "night" Or maybe a bite "bite" I could show you my favourite obsession I've been making a man With blonde hair and a tan And he's good for relieving my tension.
FRANK	I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.
GUESTS	"Sweet Transvestite"
FRANK	From Transexual Transylvania.
GUESTS	"Transylvania"
FRANK	So come up to the Lab.
FRANK (Cont)	And see what's on the slab. I see you shiver with anticipation But maybe the rain Is really to blame So I'll remove the cause But not the symptom
COLUMBIA	Slowly, slowly. It's too nice a job to rush.
JANET	Oh Brad.
BRAD	It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
BRAD	Ah, hi. My name is Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. You are ...
COLUMBIA	You are very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory. Some people would give their right arm for the privilege.
BRAD	People like you maybe
COLUMBIA	I've seen it.
JANET	It he - Frank - is he your husband?
RIFF RAFF	The Master is not yet married. Nor do I think he ever will be. We are simply his servants.
JANET	Oh.
FRANK	Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.
FRANK	I will entertain...ah...
BRAD	I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
JANET	Weiss.
BRAD	Weiss. Encante....How nice. (he circles them) And what charming underclothes you both have. and hands them to Brad). But here, put these on. They'll make you feel less vulnerable. It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. Hospitality! All we wanted to do was use your telephone. A reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore. Don't be ungrateful Brad.
BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank)	Ungrateful!
FRANK	How forceful you are Brad. Such a perfect specimen of manhood. So dominant.
JANET	Well, yes I am.
FRANK	Do you have any tattoos Brad.
BRAD	Certainly not!
FRANK	Oh well. How about you. (He laughs)
RIFF RAFF	Everything is in readiness, Master. We merely await your word.
FRANK	Tonight...One, one, one. Can you hear me at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.
FRANK	Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research.
FRANK	And paradise is to be mine.
FRANK	It was strange the way it happened. One of those quirks of fate really. One of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost: you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. There's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break. (He cracks the bones in his hand) All the pieces seem to fit into place. What a sucker you'r been. What a fool. The answer was there all the time. It took a small accident to make it happen. An accident!
MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly)	An accident.
FRANK	That's how I discovered the secret. That elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life. You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate. For tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born.
FRANK	Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator.
FRANK	And step up the reactor power input three more points.
JANET	Brad...
BRAD	It's alright Janet.
ROCKY	The Sword of Damocles is Hanging over my head.
ROCKY	And I've got the feeling Someone's going to be Cutting the thread. My life is a misery.
Oh, can't you see	That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer....
ROCKY	I woke up this morning With a start When I fell out of bed. That ain't no crime.
ROCKY	And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
GUESTS	That ain't no crime
ROCKY	My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.
And all I know	Is I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer. Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
ROCKY	Oh, no no, no no.
GUESTS	Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
ROCKY	No no no, no no.
GUESTS	Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
NARRATOR	Rocky needed peace of mind. He didn't know He was doing just fine.
He was the product	Of another time. And as for feeling down - Well that's not a crime. That ain't no crime. The sword of Damocles is Hanging over my head.
GUESTS	That ain't no crime. And I've got the feeling Someone's going to be Cutting the thread.
GUESTS	That ain't no crime. Oh, woe is me - My life is a mystery. Oh can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer.

GUESTS	Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
FRANK	Well. That's no way to behave on your first day out.
But as you're such an	exceptional beauty I'm prepared to forgive. He is a credit to your genius, Master.
FRANK	Yes. A triumph of your vill.
FRANK	Yes. He's o.k.
FRANK	O.K? (Moving out behind tank towards Janet and Brad) I think we can do a little better than that.
JANET	Well. (She looks at Brad) I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
FRANK	I didn't make him for you
He carries the Charles Atlas seal of	approval....And he didn't even take the lessons.
FRANK	A weakling weighing Ninety eight pounds Will get sand in his face When kicked to the ground. And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse) With a determined chin The sweat from his pores As he works for his ca-ha-hause
FRANK	Will make him glisten - thank you - And gleam. And with massage And just a little bit of He'll be pink. And quite clean.
FRANK	He'll be a strong man - Oh honey -
GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK.	But the wrong man.
FRANK	He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to build up his shoulders, His chest, arms and legs.
Such an effort -	If he only knew of my plan. In just seven days,
GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK	I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an
FRANK	He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and jerk.
He thinks dynamic tension	Must be hard work. Such strenuous living I just don't understand.
When, in just seven days -	Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.)
I can make you	A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh).
COLUMBIA	Eddie!
EDDIE	Stay cool baby.
JANET	Who's Eddie?
RIFF RAFF	The delivery boy.
MAGENTA	His delivery wasn't good enough though.
EDDIE	Whatever happened to Saturday night When you dressed up sharp And you felt alright It don't seem the same since cosmic light Came into my life and I thought I was divine. And listen to the music on the radio. And we climbed in the back And we really had a good time
ALL	Bless my soul I really love that rock and roll
EDDIE	My head used to swim From the perfume I smelled. My hands kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's when I'd melt. And she'd whisper in my ear, Tonight she really was mine.
Get back in front and put	Some hair oil on. Buddy Holly was singing His very last song. With your arms around your girl You tried to - ah - sing along It felt pretty good, whoo. Really had a good ti-i-ime.
ALL	Hot patootie Bless my soul. I really love that rock and roll.

FRANK	One from the vaults.
Oh no, my little Adonis -	You're much too beautiful to be destroyed. He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle.
FRANK	But a deltoid And a bicep, A hot groin And a tricep Makes me - ooh - Shake. Makes me want Charles Atlas By the ha-and. Oh baby -
GUESTS, RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK	I can make you a Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.
I don't want no dissension	Just dynamic tension.
In just seven days	I can make you A ma-ha-ha-ha-haan.
In just seven days	I can make you A ma-ha-ha-ha-haaan.
NARRATOR	There are some people who say that life is an illusion, and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations! If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. However, the sudden departure of their host and his creation (into the seclusion of his sombre bridal suite) had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. A feeling which grew as the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their separate rooms.
JANET	Who is it? Who's there?
BRAD'S VOICE	It's only me, Janet.
JANET	Oh, Brad, come in, darling.
JANET	Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
BRAD	It's alright Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
JANET	Oh, I hope so my darling. But let me switch on the light.
BRAD	No, don't do that.
JANET	Oh don't be so shy.
JANET	YOU!
FRANK	I'm afraid so, Janet. But isn't it nice?
JANET	You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
FRANK	Nothing. Why, do you think I should?
JANET	You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
FRANK	I know. But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
JANET	Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help. I - Brad - Oh. Brad.
FRANK	Ssssh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
JANET	Like this - like how? It's your fault. You're to blame. I was saving myself.
FRANK	Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
JANET	Promise you won't tell Brad.
FRANK	Cross my heart and hope to die.
JANET'S VOICE	Oh Brad, it's no good here. It will destroy us.
BRAD	Don't worry Janet, we'll be away from here in the morning. Hmmmm, you smell so good.
JANET	Oh Brad. Oh no. Not till after the wedding, Darling.
BRAD	Alright, Janet. I understand.
JANET	Maybe we could try it this way.
BRAD	Janet! Oh! Yes it's alright. Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
JANET	I hope so my darling.
BRAD	You!
FRANK	I'm afraid so, Brad. But wasn't it nice?
BRAD	Why you - what have you done with Janet?
FRANK	Nothing. Why do you think I should?
BRAD	You tricked me. I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
FRANK	I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable. Oh so soft. So sensual.
BRAD	Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet. Janet.
FRANK	Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
BRAD	Like this. Like how? It's your fault - you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.
FRANK	Oh come on, Brad, admit it. It was enjoyable, wasn't it? There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure. Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time already. Janet needn't know, I won't tell her.
BRAD	You promise you won't tell?
FRANK	On my mother's grave.
RIFF RAFF	Master, Rocky has broken his chains and vanished. The new playmate is loose and in the castle ground. Magenta has just released the dogs.
FRANK	I'm coming.
JANET	What's happening here? Where's Brad? Where's anybody?
BRAD	Once in a while she don't want to call you Speaking on the telephone Once in your life she won't want to know you You look around The one you've found She is gone.
JANET	I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
BRAD	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
JANET	I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No! But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
BRAD	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
JANET	I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
BRAD	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
JANET	If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
NARRATOR	"If" and "Only", two small words. Words which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet's thoughts. But it was too late to go back now. It was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave. It would be folly to fight against it. Her only chance would be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive.
JANET	Yes. There you see it's instinctive. This room is your womb. You returned here for one thing - security.
JANET	Oh Brad! What have they done with him?
JANET	Ahhh!
JANET	Oh Brad. How could you? Oh, but you're hurt. Did they do this to you?
JANET	Here, lie down. I'll dress your wounds.
NARRATOR	"Emotion". Mental agitation - an excited state of. It is also an irrational and powerful master and from what Janet had witnessed on the monitor, there seemed to be little doubt that she was indeed its slave.
COLUMBIA & MAGENTA	Tell us about it, Janet.
JANET	I was feeling done in Couldn't win I'd only ever kissed before
COLUMBIA	You mean she only ever kissed?
JANET	I thought there's no use getting Into heavy petting.
It only leads to trouble	And seat wetting.
JANET	Now all I want to know Is how to go I've tasted blood And I want more I'll put up no resistance I want to stay the distance I've got an itch to scratch And I need assistance.
JANET	Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me. Creature of the night.
Then if anything grows (she laughs)	While you pose, I'll oil you up And rub you down
RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA, COLUMBIA	Down, down down.
JANET	And that's just one small fraction Of the main attraction You need a friendly hand. Oh, and I need action.
Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me.	I wanna be dirty. Thrill me, chil me, fulfil me. Creature of the night.
COLUMBIA	Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me.
MAGENTA	I wanna be dirty.
MAGENTA	Creature of the night.
JANET	Oh, touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. I wanna be dirty. Thrill me chill me, fulfil me - oh - Creature of the night.
ROCKY	Creature of the night. Creature of the night.
FRANK	Creature of the night. Creature of the night.
RIFF RAFF	Creature of the night. Creature of the night. Creature of the night. Creature of the night. Oh.
RIFF RAFF	Aaaargh! Mercy.
FRANK	How did it happen? I understood you were to be watching.
RIFF RAFF	I was only away for a minute Master.
FRANK	Well, see if you can find him on the monitor.
RIFF RAFF	Master, we have a visitor.
BRAD	Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
RIFF RAFF	You know this earth - this person.
BRAD	I most certainly do. He happens to be an old friend of mine.
FRANK	I see. So this wasn't simply a chance meeting. You came here with a purpose.
BRAD	I told you, my car broke down.
BRAD	I was telling the truth.
FRANK	I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott. His name is not unknown to me.
BRAD	He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
FRANK	And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad? He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's. Isn't he, Brad?
BRAD	He might be. I don't know.
FRANK	Hmmmm. He'll be in the Zen Room.
FRANK	Well, let's ask him.
BRAD	Dr. Scott!
DR SCOTT	Brad! What are you doing here?
FRANK	Don't play games, Dr Scott. You know very well what Brad Majors's doing here. It was part of your plan was it not that he, and his female, should check the layout for you. Well, unfortunately for you all there's to be a change of plans. I'm sure you're adaptable, Dr Scott. I know Brad is.
DR SCOTT	I can assure you that Brad's presence comes as a complete surprise to me. I came to find Eddie.
BRAD	Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
FRANK	Eddie? What do you know of Eddie, Dr Scott?
DR SCOTT	I happen to know a great deal about a lot of things. You see Eddie happens to be my nephew.
BRAD	Dr Scott.
DR SCOTT	Janet!
JANET	Dr Scott!
BRAD	Janet!
FRANK	Rocky!
FRANK	Listen! I made you, and I can break you just as easily.
FRANK	That's better.
MAGENTA	Master, dinner is prepared.
FRANK	
Doctor Scott you can sample the	speciality of the house - roast loin of pork.
FRANK	Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be optional.
NARRATOR	Food has always played a vital role in life's rituals. The breaking of bread - the last meal of the condemned man - and now this meal. However informal it might appear you can be sure there was to be very little 'bonhomie'.
FRANK	A toast to absent friends.
ALL	Absent friends.
DR. SCOTT	We came here to discuss Eddie.
COLUMBIA	Eddie! It's a rather tender subject.... Another slice anyone.
COLUMBIA	Excuse me.
DR. SCOTT (turning aside)	I knew he was in with a bad crowd. But it was worse than I imagined...(He turns back) Aliens!
BRAD & JANET	Dr. Scott!
FRANK	Go on, Dr. Scott - or should I say doctor von Scott.
BRAD	What exactly are you implying?
DR. SCOTT	That's alright Brad.
BRAD	But Doctor Scott...
DR. SCOTT	From the day he was born, he was trouble.
He was the thorn	In his mutter's side.
NARRATOR	But he never caused her Nothing but shame. DR. SCOTT produces scrapbook, opening it at a picture of Eddie's mother.
DR. SCOTT	He left home the day she died.
From the day she was gone	All he wanted
DR. SCOTT	Was rock and roll,
He was a low down	Cheap little punk.
ALL	When Eddie said He didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no good kid.
But when he threatened your life	With a switch blade knife
FRANK	What a guy
JANET	Makes you cry
DR. SCOTT	Und I did. She has a large portrait of EDDIE on the wall.
COLUMBIA	Everybody shoved him, I very nearly loved him. I said, hey listen to me, Stay sane inside insanity. But he locked the door And threw away the key. DR. SCOTT Making him warn, me, In a note
ALL	What's it say, What's it say?
EDDIE (VO)	I'm out of my head Oh hurry, or I may be dead. They mustn't carry out their evil deeds, Yaaaow.
ALL	When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no good kid.
DR. SCOTT	Und when he threatened your life With a switch blade knife
FRANK	What guy
JANET	Makes you cry
ALL	Eddie!
ALL	When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no good kid.
But when he threatened your life	With a switch blade knife
FRANK	What a guy
ALL	Woe woe woe
JANET	Makes you cry
ALL	Hey hey hey Und I did
ALL	EDDIE!
FRANK	Oh Rocky, how could you!
FRANK	I'll tell you once, Won't tell you twice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss.
Y'apple pie	Don't taste too nice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss.
FRANK	I've laid the seed It should be all you need.
You're as sensual	As a pencil Wound up like an 'E' or first string
FRANK	When we made it Did ya hear a bell ring?
FRANK	Y'got a block, Take my advice. You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss.
FRANK	Will seduce yah.
JANET	My feet - I can' move my feet.
DR. SCOTT	My wheels - My God, I can't move my wheels.
BRAD	It's as if we were glued to the spot.
FRANK	You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
JANET	We're trapped. It's something you'll Get used to. A mental mind fuck Can be nice.
JANET	Oh!
DR. SCOTT	You won't find earth people quite the easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer - it is, I suppose, some kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device....
BRAD	You mean...
DR. SCOTT	Yes Brad. It's something we ourselves have been working on. But it seems our friend here has found a way of perfecting it. A device which is capable of breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space, and - who knows - perhaps even time itself!
JANET	You mean he's gonna send us to another planet?
FRANK	Planet.
FRANK	You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. You'd better wise up, Build your thighs up. You'd better wise up.
NARRATOR	Then she cries out -
JANET	Sto-o-o-o-o-op. Don't get hot and flustered - Use a bit of mustard.
BRAD	You're a hot dog But you'd better not Try to hurt her, Frank Furter.
DR. SCOTT	You're a hot dog But you'd better not Try to hurt her, Frank Furter.
JANET	You're a hot dog...
COLUMBIA	My God! I can't take any more of this - first you spurn me for Eddie, then you cast him off like an old overcoat for Rocky. You chew people up and then spit them out - I loved you, do you hear me - I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - I'll tell you - a big nothing. You're like a sponge. You take, take, take, take! You drain others of their love and emotions. Well, I've had enough. You've got to choose between me and Rocky - so named because of the rocks in his head.
FRANK	It's not easy having a good time.
FRANK	My children turn on me. Rocky's behaving just as Eddie did. Maybe I made a mistake in splitting his brain between the two of them.
MAGENTA	When will we return to Transylvania? I grow weary of this world.
FRANK	Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother RIff Raff - you have both served me well - loyalty such as yours must be rewarded and you will discover when the mood takes me I can be quite generous.
MAGENTA	I ask for nothing, Master.
FRANK	And you shall receive it - in abundance. Come. We are ready for the floor show. Our guests will be growing restless.
NARRATOR	And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott. But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen. And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion. What further indignities were they to be subjected to? And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of? What indeed? From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic.
COLUMBIA	It was great when it all began I was a regular Frank fan. But it was over when he had the plan To start working on a muscle-man. Now the only thing that gives me hope Is my love of a certain dope Rose tints my world keeps me Safe from my trouble and pain.
ROCKY	I'm just seven hours old Truly beautiful to behold And somebody should be told My libido hasn't been controlled Now the only thing I've come to trust Is an orgasmicÊrush of lust Rose tints my world keeps me Safe from my trouble and pain.
BRAD	It's beyond me Help me Mommy I'll be good you'll see Take this dream away What's this, let's see I feel sexy What's come over me Here it comes again.
JANET	I feel released Bad times deceased My confidence increased Reality is here The game has been disbanded My mind has been expanded It's a gas that Frankie's landed His lust is so sincere.
FRANK	What ever happened to Fay Wray That delicate satin-draped frame As it clung to her thigh How I started to cry For I wanted to be dressed just the same.
FRANK	Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh Erotic nightmares Beyond any measure And sensual daydreams To treasure forever.
Can't you just see it.	Can't you just see it.
ALL	Don't dream it. Be it.
DR. SCOTT	Ach, we've got to get out of this trap before this decadence saps our wills. I've got to be strong and try to hang on. Or else my mind, may well snap.
DR. SCOTT	Und my life will be lived, For the thri-i-i-i-ill...
BRAD	It's beyond me Help me Mo-ommy.
JANET	God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.
FRANK	My my my my I'm a wild and an untamed thing. I'm a bee with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping. Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing. So let the party and the sounds rock on. Gonna shake it till the life has gone.
Rose tint my world	Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.
ALL	I'm a wild and an untamed thing I'm a bee with a deadly sting. Get a hit and your mind goes ping Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.
So let the part and the sounds rock on	Gonna shake it till the life has gone. Rose tint my world Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.
RIFF RAFF	Frank N. Furter It's all over Your mission is a failure.
I'm your new Commander.	You are now my prisoner.
We return to Transylvania	Prepare the transit beam.
FRANK	Wait! I can explain.
FRANK	On the day I went away.
GUESTS	Goodbye
FRANK	Was all I had to say
GUESTS	Now I
FRANK	Want to come again and stay
GUESTS	Oh my, my,
FRANK	Smile and that will mean I may
FRANK	I've seen blue skies Through the tears in my eyes And I realise I'm going home I'm going home
GUESTS	Feeling
FRANK	Like I'm outside in the rain
GUESTS	Wheeling
FRANK	Free to try and find a game
GUESTS	Dealing
FRANK	Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
I've seen blue skies	Through the tears in my eyes And I realise I'm going home I'm going home. I'm going home.
MAGENTA	How sentimental.
RIFF RAFF	And also presumptuous of you. You see when I said "we" were to return to Transylvania, I referred only to Magenta and myself.
RIFF RAFF	You see, you are to remain here, in spirit anyway.
DR SCOTT	Great Heavens, that's a laser.
RIFF RAFF	Yes, Dr Scott. A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
BRAD	You mean you're going to kill him? What's his crime?
DR SCOTT	You saw what became of Eddie. Society must be protected.
RIFF RAFF	Exactly, Dr Scott. Now Frank N. Furter, your time has come. Say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.
FRANK	Do your worse - inferior one.
BRAD	Good God.
RIFF RAFF	Yes.
JANET	You've killed them.
MAGENTA	I thought you liked them. They liked you.
RIFF RAFF	They didn't like me. They never liked me.
DR SCOTT	You did right.
RIFF RAFF	A decision had to be made.
DR SCOTT	You're OK by me.
RIFF RAFF	Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
DR SCOTT	Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
RIFF RAFF	You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible. We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
RIFF RAFF	Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
MAGENTA	Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains. To take that step to the right...
RIFF RAFF	But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
MAGENTA	And our World will do the Time Warp again.
BRAD	I've done a lot God knows I've tried To find the truth I've even lied But all I know is down inside.
BRAD & DR SCOTT	I'm bleeding.
JANET	And super heroes Come to feast To taste the flesh Not yet deceased And al I know Is still the beast
TRIO	Is feeding.
NARRATOR	And crawling on the planet's face Some insects called the human race Lost in time, and lost in space And meaning.
VOICES OFF	Meaning.
