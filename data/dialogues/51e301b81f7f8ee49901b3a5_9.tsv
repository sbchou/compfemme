SCIENTIST	My last possible solution.... It must work...
DICTATOR	Perfect.
SCIENTIST	You see, it evolves.
DICTATOR	Yes. Perfect. Alert. We are in a state of emergency...

SCIENTIST	My invention... my beauty... beauty was taken... Reports are coming in... they've breached the Northern walls of the city...
RADIO (V.O.)	An announcement from our Chancellor!
DICTATOR'S VOICE	Comrades, I have lost control. The Machine is now our enemy. We need to join forces to fight against it.
SCIENTIST	Five so far....I can't get them right...
RADIO (V.O.)	Gas masks are being distributed... ALERT: beware.... ...deadly gas....

2 (CONT'D)	The details... how exciting. Carved wood... steel bolts... molded copper...
2 (CONT'D)	You can't speak. Yes, yes...

Wait.. ...almost there... Friend? Friend? Friend. Are we alone? No. There are others. But how strange.... muttering to himself as Yes, he was always drawing this... exactly like this... how strange... GO! stands, ready to attack. The others... Where am I? With us. Yes... he told me there were others... Who? He was older... Out there... Alone? Was he all right? hen is he coming back? T T hing! It took him. No... No! It can't be! Keeping secrets from me, I see. I... I was coming to tell you... hat's this? ... I found him.... in the emptiness. He saw-- What? What were you doing out there? I saw him from the watchtower and I thought...
ou'll lead The Beast straight back	to us! How many times have I told you? The Beast--that's what took 2! If we hurry we could save him-- If the Beast took him, that's the end of it. But he was still alive-- No, we have RULES. Our new guest seems confused. Perhaps I can help you achieve some clarity. He was still alive? Really? I think so-- Hmmmph! braces himself as 8 pulls them up into a tall tower. He ...it was chaos... Man and Machine attacked each other with fire and metal... The earth split and the skies burned... I found others... T he bomb lets out a yellow CLOUD that envelops the area and There's a path ahead-- Go ahead.
1 (CONT'D)	Follow me. The gas killed everything. I led us here... ...to sanctuary. And here we waited for the war to end. Slowly, the world became silent. The only thing that remains now is the Beast.

No! You're not listening. He may	still be alive! Why won't you try to save him? Why won't you-- Enough! Enough of this madness! Go to the watch tower and take our guest with you. The source.... The source... rom a high angle we see the nave of the Cathedral. It has This was the first thing we built together. looking around at the map, bits and pieces, All his work... trying to make sense of everything. Is he out there? Is he still alive? Yes. He could be. they're not being spied We could go after him. Us? We MUST go. Look. That's where the creature took him. Out towards those three tall shapes. Ohhhh... no... we can't... not there. We need to stay here. We have rules. Why do you listen to 1? A group must have a leader. looks at him for a beat. But what if the leader is wrong? I'm going. I'm going to look for him. Come with me. I can't do it alone. He hesitates: I... I...

You're going to need a map. and 9 look around constantly, on the alert for the Cat You looked out for him? He looked out for me. He taught me. Why was he out here alone? We can still find him. Why was he out here alone? Yes. The ones we're not supposed to ask. here are we? I don't know... It's no use. We should go back!

t the pat, 2 blinks 2	awake. I knew you would come... Shhh... now pulls off her bird-skull helmet. You weren't lost-- You've come back! I never left. YOU finally decided to join the fight.
7 (CONT'D)	I think I know why. Rusty... hacked together... shoddy pile of scrap. Look! experimentally put the talisman INTO the port. No! Stop! NO! Quickly! Run! Get away! T he Machine points the talisman towards 2 and it OPENS up to Factory.] My poor old friend... I know. What? What on earth were you thinking? I didn't know... I'm sorry... What WAS that? What is it doing?

7 (CONT'D)	They're cataloguing. We need you--we awakened something-- I awakened something. In the factory. Something terrible... That's it! -Dutch-angle shots of the Dictator, and we hear his SPEECH--
ICTATOR	...yes, we have entered a new future, the age of the intelligent machine. This remarkable invention can adapt and evolve, creating new machines, machines of PEACE--- --that will usher in a new era of PROSPERITY-- --and brotherhood for our nation! The thing! Show them. Wait! 6... he always draws that. used to keep the drawings... with his notes.... there? In 2's old workshop? Yes. I saved everything. hen we'll go back. Perhaps the answer is there. I think the answer is there. You awakened what? You fools! I warned you! He warned you. Now you've put us all in unimaginable peril. And, may I ask, did you manage to save 2? Of course not! By following this witless folly, you've endangered everything we work for! Why was 2 sent out to begin with? I sent him to scout. That doesn't make any sense! You don't send the oldest out to-- Look, we need to figure out what's going on-- The source... You must go back to the source.... What? What is it? Where? I won't allow you to endanger us further. Subjugate them. Take their belongings! grabs 6's drawing and lifts 5 from his crossbow and shakes ou're nothing but a coward! How dare you challenge me! I, who kept everyone safe all these years. Ever since you got here everything has been unraveling. You're a curse. A fool guided by pointless queries. A nd you are a blind man guided by fear. The sky... the sky is breaking.... ometimes fear is the appropriate response. The source... the source... flees. 8 charges the Beast but it SCYTHES its wing towards S uddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behind Take him inside. T he Beast flinches just as it FIRES its harpoon tail at them. I thought you might need some help. My spear! between her leg and the Winged Beast. The cable! Cut it!
A	Grab on! The propeller! Start the propeller! My... my cape! Let it go! looks at 7 urgently, nodding to her. She gets it You fool! We can still save ourselves! Your rope. Oh... my sanctuary... No. Stand lookout. I'll search out a safer retreat. There will be more, won't there? Forget him. You wanted us to forget you, too? Why did you leave us? I couldn't sit and hide, just waiting. I just couldn't. It's... It's not in my nature. And perhaps, no longer in yours, either? C LOSE on a DRAWING OF the TALISMAN'S RUNES in ancient An alchemist's ability to draw animus into the unanimated... Again! What is it? What can it be? The source...! What? What are you trying to say? The first room--
'S VOICE	Dark science. What good does this useless rubbish do us? Forget it! The source... the source... I know enough to leave their ancient evils to moulder. Look what they have left us with. Leave it be, I say! But you. Always asking questions, so many pointless questions-- probing, pushing-- spitting out the words, like 2--he always had to know--too MUCH-- I was right! You did send him out to die! No! He was old! He was weak!
1 (CONT'D)	Sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many. Coward! Stop! We must work together. We must use our thoughts, not our weapons. The answer to all our questions is here, in some way. I can feel it. We must follow this path... Your path takes us to catastrophe. picks his way through the stacks, ranting to himself. an't he see his way only brings trouble? What good comes from his path? I know what we need. I know what is right-- No.... attached to her belly and disappears.

S	All right. I'll go inside. You do as we planned. EXACTLY as we planned. Take charge. e see the barrel is on top of a small hill that leads down OV through the Seamstress's damaged eye: a MOVEMENT in the PULL! here are they? It's been too long. We should take action. Are you forgetting what he said? If he doesn't return--continue as planned. EXACTLY as planned! No--stop! Fool! More creatures! We have to ACT! NOW! No! Not yet--
9'S VOICE	What did I tell you? Light it! Now! Now! T he group turns and watches the factory as it burns to the It's done. And some of us very much alive. I've been a bitter old pill, haven't I?
1 (CONT'D)	I lost sight... of many things.
9 (CONT'D)	What's past is past. It was always so heavy. e now runs his hand over his head, which we now see has a No... it .... it... it... Run! Run! No! There's nothing you can do! No! No!

SCIENTIST'S VOICE	It had such promise... my first creation... ...but it was taken... and bent to such evil... ...so little hope remains... that is why I create you...
SCIENTIST'S VOICE (cont'd)	I am unable to reverse the transfer process... my life force diminishes with each one of you... it is all right... you will thrive...
SCIENTIST'S VOICE (cont'd)	...so little hope remains... that is why I create you...
SCIENTIST	... it's up to you now... ...you...you are all the pieces of my soul... You. You're the source...

9 (CONT'D)	The Scientist! The one who made the machine. He gave us life too. How? He... he used his own soul. That's why the machine is hunting us. It was warped, reprogrammed to hunt humanity. It, and the machines it made, killed everything. Except us.
9 (CONT'D)	We're all that remains. No! Don't destroy it!
What? It's hunting us! It'll	never stop! You said it yourself! No. First we have to get them back. It's impossible! It isn't. I have an idea. Enough of your ideas! We need to load the weapon! Stop! You're a fool! It powers down right after it takes a soul! Just for a few seconds. Yes, it does. You'll see. I'll let it take my soul. Then after.... take the device. But what if you're wrong? Don't do this-- must. No! What are you doing? Stop! They left us nothing. Nothing. What right did they have to burden us? Why did we have to right their wrongs? So I refused. I refused our path. But now... I see... we cannot refuse it. We are all that's left. We must complete our journey. Sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many. Go! Get away! Hurry! NO--NO-- darts in and GRABS the TALISMAN.
