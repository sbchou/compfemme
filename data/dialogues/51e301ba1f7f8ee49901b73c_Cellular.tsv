RYAN	Why, you writing a book--?
JESSICA	--Please, just tell me your name! Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone
RYAN	Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.
JESSICA	Johnny... What if it was your mother who was calling for help? How would you feel?
RYAN	Well, I'd be damn impressed, considering she's dead.
JESSICA	Goddamn it, how difficult is it to hand this phone off to the police?! I'll pay you!

RYAN	What do you want me to do? In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams Sounds are distant, eerily muffled. A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE CLOSE UP: BOB MOONEY'S EYES. Concerned, but not panicked. SFX: A HEARTBEAT. OURS. FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR? MOONEY'S EYES. Watching. Counting... Suddenly --
ROOKIE OFFICER	Problem, Mooney. If I put this one in with the others, there's gonna be a bloodbath.

Though the names of six police officers were read aloud, the District Attorney stated that this was merely the "tip of the iceberg" and that unfortunately many other arrests are likely to be coming as the investigations proceed.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN	Sucks for the fellas at the Two- Three right now, huh?
MOONEY	Dirty pricks deserve what they get. Public hates us enough without this shit.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN	There's good men over there. A FEMALE OFFICER passes Mooney and reaches for his box of
FEMALE OFFICER	Mooney? What are you doing? You can't be eating this crap. Mooney plants his own firm grip on the box.
MOONEY	Keep walking, Shelly. Nothing to see here. A friendly tug of war.
FEMALE OFFICER	You sure you wanna do that? What would your wife say? That's it. Mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to
MOONEY	She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not gonna know about it! Christ, Shel, my old man had eleven heart attacks. Eleven! I have one little infarction and you guys start treating me like an invalid! I'm a grown man! Leave me alone, will you?!
FEMALE OFFICER	I was merely referring to your cottage-cheese ass. Mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when -- I hate this place.
RYAN	I'm here. Ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way through the

RYAN	Excuse me, officer -- But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that Hey, I've got an emergency here -- Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a

CREWCUT OFFICER	Hey, Moon! Where do you want me to put Whitney Houston?
MOONEY	Christ, I've only got two hands here! Stick him in the can, will ya? Crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom.
RYAN	Come on, man! I've got some lady on the phone here who says she's been kidnapped!
MOONEY	Nice try, kid, but I got no time for pranks.
RYAN	Seriously, a lady was murdered!
MOONEY	Which is it, a kidnapping or a murder?
RYAN	Take the phone and find out moron! A COP snickers somewhere.
JESSICA	Please. . .
MOONEY	Okay. Give it here. Ryan thrusts the phone at him, happy to get rid of it.
JESSICA (VO)	Oh thank God! You've got to help me. My name's Jessica Martin and I've been kidnapped. This morning five men broke into my home in Brentwood and kidnapped-- Mooney strains to hear. His eyes go wide and he quickly jots Mooney's eyes shift as three TWEAKERS, wide eyed and sweating
MOONEY	Ah shit. Mooney holds out the phone.
MOONEY (CONT'D)	Hurry kid, take this upstairs to Robbery/Homicide and ask for Detective Tomlin.
RYAN (VO)	Where?
JESSICA	Hello? Officer? Hello?!
BACK TO POLICE STATION 28	
MOONEY	Up the stairs, Tomlin! Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear,
JESSICA (VO)	Oh my God...
RYAN	What? What is it?
RYAN (VO)	Lady, what's going on?! Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it
LEAD KIDNAPPER	Where's your husband?
JESSICA	What? I don't- The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica The Leader bends down and yells right in her face. Where is he!?
JESSICA	At work! Why, what do you want--? SLAP!!! This one's even nastier than the first.
RYAN	Oh shit... Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs The Lead Kidnapper stands ominously over the trembling
JESSICA	Please, he should be at work! That's all I know. The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with
LEAD KIDNAPPER	You have a little boy, right? Ricky? The Wyman School in Westwood? Jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest.
LEAVE HIM ALONE!!	But -- the men silently head out the door -- SLAM! The door
JESSICA (CONT'D)	Johnny!!
RYAN	I know. I'm trying to get help. My son -- Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts
JESSICA (CONT'D)	Oh my God! What's happening?!
RYAN	It's just static. I'm running upstairs to the detectives. Hold on, I might lose you for a sec-- No, don't! Stop. You can't lose me--
RYAN	Wait, we're almost there.
JESSICA	Stop! Johnny, goddamn it, stop! Hearing her fearful tone, Ryan stops reluctantly.
RYAN	Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?! Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot.
RYAN (CONT'D)	Jesus! I'm almost there! Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone.
RYAN (CONT'D)	Crap!
SOMEONE GET TOMLIN FOR ME, PLEASE?!	There's no response. Ryan can't believe this. You're shitting me.
JESSICA	Johnny, what time is it?! Johnny!
RYAN	Who? Oh -- one-twenty.
IS ANYONE UP THERE?!	Jessica calms herself, resolving to save her child's life.
JESSICA	Johnny, listen to me. My son's school lets out at 1:45.
RYAN	Good, then if I get a cop-- Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not
JESSICA	No. There's not enough time. You have to pick him up before they--
RYAN	Pick him up? Hell no, lady! I ain't goin' nowhere else-- Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream.
JESSICA	Please please stop standing there! He 's just a little boy!
RYAN	But I'm in a police station!
JESSICA	Go! Ryan grunts in frustration.
REVEAL GREER	Forties, salt and pepper hair. He looks to his crew: Greer snaps the TV off. Checks his watch and nods grimly.
GREEK	Go get the kid. Instantly, a hulk of a man (DEASON) and an arrogant, red- PUSH IN on the flashing orange light that threatens to give Where are you now?!
RYAN	I just got off the 405.
JESSICA (VO)	You've got to go faster, Johnny!
RYAN	You've gotta chill! You're stressing the crap out of me! Where the hell is a cop hiding in a speed trap when you need one? Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing. Pushing it against What do these guys want, anyway? How should I know?!
RYAN	What do you do?
JESSICA	I'm an obstetrician. They don't want anything from me.
RYAN	So your husband's like, uber-rich?
JESSICA (VO)	What--? No. He's an accountant. I make more money than he does.
RYAN	Could they've mistaken you for someone else?
JESSICA	No! I don't know. None of this makes any sense. Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much And dead ahead is a CONSTRUCTION CREW resurfacing the road!
RYAN	Oh...SHIT!! Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group Ryan cringes with every muscle! And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes
RYAN (CONT'D)	...Ain't that a bitch. As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --
RYAN (CONT'D)	There's the school. Ryan's right. Just ahead, we see: boys. Ryan pulls over and hops
RYAN	Okay, I'm here. How much time do we have? Ryan checks his watch. It reads: "1:40 PM". He enters.
RYAN	Five minutes. What's your kid's name?
JESSICA (VO)	Ricky.
RYAN	Ricky what?
JESSICA	Martin.
RYAN	Ricky Martin? You named your kid Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you tattoo "kick me" on his ass while you were at it?
JESSICA	He was named before the singer ever-
RYAN	Forget it. What does he look like?
JESSICA (VO)	He's eight years old. Blonde hair. Green eyes. Small for his age. He's wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants--
RYAN	They're all wearing blue shirts and pants! Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right. It's Ricky Martin? The Boy's eyes get huge. He tries to pull away.
TIMID BOY	Don't touch me!
RYAN	No, kid, it's okay! I didn't mean to-- Help! Don't touch me! Don't touch!! Ryan quickly moves on... aware that other ADULTS are now
RYAN (INTO PHONE)	Does he have anything else? A jacket? A backpack? What's his lunch box look like? I don't remember.
RYAN	You don't remember your own kid's lunch box?!
JESSICA	I don't pack it! Rosario, our housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig, but... Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.
RYAN	Ricky Martin, where are you!? None of the Stepford kids respond.
JESSICA (VO)	I wish I could give you more. Now Ryan's running. He yells into a BATHROOM.
RYAN	Ricky Martin? Can I help you, sir? Ryan turns to see a MUSCULAR GYM TEACHER looming there.
RYAN	I'm looking for a little blond boy-- --No, no! Not like that!
GYM TEACHER	Sir, come with me, please! Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS.
RYAN	Oh shit... WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't believe I'm yelling this at an all- boys school. All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge

JESSICA (VO)	He'11 go to the parents' pick-up spot. Oh God, they're going to get him! Ryan turns around and starts bulling through. The Gym
GYM TEACHER	Where do you think you're going? --causing the phone to fly out of Ryan's hand and --crack!--
RYAN	No--! Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone. The LCD
RYAN (CONT'D)	Jessica? You still there?! Yes? Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.
RYAN	No one's gonna get your kid! He's not slow, is he? What--? No! Then he won't go anywhere with strangers.
JESSICA (VO)	Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11 think it's Rosario and hop right in! She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the
RYAN	What color?
JESSICA	Black!
RYAN	Of course it is. PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac There's three of them. What's your plate? 4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I don't remember!
RYAN	Like you don't remember the lunch box? Or anything else about your kid-- Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't it?
JESSICA (VO)	No!
RYAN	Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady. Your friends too. Getting me to scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys school. Damn, you really nailed me. No-- This is great, the police think I'm a whack job. The school thinks I'm some kind of perv child molester. I'll probably get the Herpes from the gym teacher's whistle -- No, Johnny, you have to listen to me-- /.' But Ryan's had enough. He turns to leave --
RYAN	I'm done being your entertainment for the day. I'm going back to the pier while I still have a chance -- -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT- Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym
GYM TEACHER	Here he is! He's the one that's been stalking the students.
RYAN	Stalking?! No, I can explain-- The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.
RENT-A-COP #1	Okay, we got him. We're at the front of the school. Sir, come with us.
RYAN	Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!! Hang on a sec! This is a huuuge misunderstanding-- A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls
JESSICA (VO)	Lord of the Rings! I forgot his father bought him a Lord of the Rings lunchbox last week! Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy
RYAN	The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name
RYAN (CONT'D)	Oh shit! You just see that?! Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner
RENT-A-COP #1	Roy, some help over here! Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway.
RYAN	Goddamn it, that little kid was just kidnapped!! Do something!!
RENT-A-COP #1	Roy--! ! The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs
JESSICA (VO)	What's happening, Ryan?!
RYAN	Don't worry, I can fix this. Oh my God. There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade.
RYAN	It's okay, I can see them ahead. Don't lose them! If you follow them back here, you can tell the police where they're holding us!
RYAN	Okay. Ellis, turns down the radio. Faking sincerity, he turns to
ELLIS	Do you want me to change the station to something else? Ricky refuses to answer. Ellis turns around, his fake smile Yeah. I like Creedence too. He's about to turn the radio volume up when --
RICKY	Where's Rosario?
ELLIS	I told you, kid, she had a doctor's appointment, so your mother asked us to pick you up. Don't worry, you'll see your mommy in a few minutes. Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that
A CITY BUS	merges into traffic from a Bus Stop right ahead of him! Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a

RYAN	Damn! There's this stupid bus-- Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of
RYAN (CONT'D)	Come on! But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the
RYAN (CONT'D)	Jesus.' Can't you go around it? There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic--
RYAN	Goddamn it! What?! Did you lose him? !
RYAN	No, I just almost got killed, is all.
JESSICA	Oh thank God!
RYAN	Thank God? That's nice. Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.
RYAN (CONT'D)	Hey, here we go!
SON- OF- A-- II	Ryan SLAMS on the brakes, SWERVES HARD to avoid a collision --
ELLIS	Anyone following us? Deason checks:
THE REARVIEW MIRROR	We see the bus about five car lengths behind, but the rent-a- Deason flashes an evil grin.
DEASON	Nan. Ryan quickly regains control of the car and steers it back on
JESSICA (VO)	What's happening?! Are you okay?! What?! Yo u lost--
RYAN	No, No! just give me a second-- As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade
RYAN (CONT'D)	Jesus! Where the hell did they go? Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the Jessica, I-- You let them get away. Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of
COP ONE	-- so of course everyone's playing dumb to what kind of drugs he's on. The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before.
COP ONE (CONT'D)	So I start searching the place. I'm about to open a closet door when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out of the bathroom. He shoots. Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun jams and BAM! Blows half his face off. Had enough black tar heroin in the closet to resurface the 405. Mooney tries to join in on the conversation.
MOONEY	The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff.
COP TWO	Sorry Moon, we're late for a briefing. Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being
DEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.)	I'll bet in your day you had some stories. Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN.
MOONEY	Hey Tomlin.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN	Taking off?
MOONEY	My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey dinner and then some crap-ass play. Hey, I sent some college kid down to see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping --
DETECTIVE TOMLIN	I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask around. Kidnapping, huh?
MOONEY	I thought it was a prank at first, but the kid was so worked up--
DETECTIVE TOMLIN	Well, don't you get worked up. If the kid comes back, page me, and I'll be sure to see him.
MOONEY	Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks. And as Tomlin walks off --
JESSICA (VO)	Look, Johnny, you've got to go back to the cops--
RYAN	Are you high?! I just jacked a car! Goddamn it, stop thinking about just yourself! You can explain everything to them later!
RYAN	What now? Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.
RYAN (CONT'D)	Great! Now the battery's dying.
JESSICA	Don't you have a charger?
RYAN	It's in my car! Hold on. SFX: BEEP-BEEP! The battery indicator has lost another bar.

JESSICA	What's going on? Did you find one?
RYAN	Not exactly... SFX: BEEP-BEEP!! Jessica starts growing afraid.
JESSICA	Johnny, don't lose me!
RYAN	Well what the hell do you expect me to do?! Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED
JESSICA	Johnny--! I know, Jessica! The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter- Ryan's got to do something. Now.
RYAN (CONT'D)	You know that money you promised me?
JESSICA (VO)	Yes.
RYAN	I'm giving myself a raise. Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope. There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly What's going on?!
RYAN	mmmrrmph mrm mrmph! Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until it back down -- SLAMM! -- so hard that the phone goes flying

RYAN (CONT'D)	Jessica?! Can you hear me?! I'm here! Ryan hops out and races inside-- Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --
IRATE CUSTOMERS	Hey, what do you think you're doing? There's a line! -- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN	..and if you get the new Nokia 9200, you can switch out faceplates to match your mood! And we have a special today on tiger stripes... Are you feeling fierce? The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.
EASILY-EXCITABLE CUSTOMER	Oh, how fun!
RYAN	Excuse me--
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN	I'm sorry, sir, I'm with a customer now.
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN (CONT'D)	But if you take a number, someone will be with you shortly. Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by. Ryan grabs her.
RYAN	Hey! Hey! I've got an emergency here --
BUSY SALESWOMAN	Sorry, I'm on break--
RYAN	Damn it, will you listen to me?! I've got a life and death call on this phone and my battery's dying! Do you have a charger?
BUSY SALESMAN	Sure. Take a number and one of the sales associates will grab you one when your turn comes up. Bu t-- !
SFX: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!	Ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. Can't catch his breath. As

SALESWOMAN	Take a number. The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's
RYAN	Aw, screw this... -- Ryan pulls the rent-a-cop's big .38 SPECIAL from his
RYAN (CONT'D)	Oh look! Now serving thirty eight special! Mooney exits the mayhem of the s tation and walks to a SQUAD Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but
MOONEY	Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a few minutes late... And as Mooney closes the door and starts up the engine--
MALE VOICE	Jessica? Damn, where are you? I called earlier and... Jess, I'm in serious trouble. I can't explain right now, but we're all in danger. Please, just grab Ricky and meet me in left field. PAN UP to an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN listening to the machine.
RYAN	Whew! That was so no bueno!
JESSICA (VO)	You found a charger?
RYAN	Among other things... Ryan glances at piles of phone gear he's appropriated from
JESSICA	Thank you for doing all this, Johnny.
RYAN	Yeah, look, about that... My-name isn't really Johnny Fountain.
JESSICA	Good, it sounded like a porn star name. It's okay. I know. You don't have to tell me --
RYAN	It's Ryan. Ryan Ackerman. I'm a bar-back. I'm twenty-two, and just a little freaked out right now. Jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty.
JESSICA	Thank you, Ryan. But before they can say any more, suddenly-- Do you want to die here? Jessica drains white -- Does he see the phone?!
RYAN	Oh shit!
BACK TO ATTIC 54	Greer's question still hangs in the air.
JESSICA	N-no... Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another
JESSICA (CONT'D)	...but I am going to, aren't I?
GREER	Up to you. Your husband left a message asking you to meet him in left field. Where's that?
JESSICA	What? I don't understand--? Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking
GREER	--A base ball field !? Wh ich o ne does he mean?!
JESSICA	I... I don't know what you want me to say. I swear--
GREER	Shut up!!! Which field?! He wouldn't leave a message that didn't make sense to you! Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again--
JESSICA	Wait! The bleachers behind left field at Dodger Stadium! That's where we first met.
JESSICA (CONT'D)	Please! Believe me. That has to be where he means. I swear to God. Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long
GREER	Working in my profession as long as I have, you begin to recognize the truth when you hear it. Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word.
GREER (CONT'D)	Go to the window, Jessica. There's something I want you to see. Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to Jessica's knees nearly buckle.
JESSICA	Ricky!
HODGES	Shoot hoops.
RICKY	I.. I don't feel like it.
HODGES	Shoot. Nervously, Ricky begins to bounce the ball. Jessica sees her son start shooting the ball -- completely You have three seconds to tell me where he really is or you're going to a funeral.
RYAN	Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!!
GREER	One.. .
JESSICA	Please! Please, believe me! Ricky plays innocently -- while Hodges now COCKS his pistol.
GREER	Two. Frantic, Jessica locks eyes with Hodges, silently pleading
JESSICA	Please, he's just a child!
RYAN	Goddamn it, listen to her! She doesn't know!!
JESSICA	No...no.' I swear that's all I know! Greer gives a sigh of disbelief -- Thre--
JESSICA	OKAY! ... okay... LAX Airport! There's a bar called Left Field. That's where we met. We were in college on our way to Mardi-gras. Ryan's completely floored by Jessica's admission. She knew
JESSICA	Please God, I swear that's the truth. Don't kill my son!
GREER	Most people don't get past two. Greer signals, and:
HODGES	Okay, kid. Let's go. Greer is about to exit the attic -- when Jessica speaks.
JESSICA	You won't get away with this. When I didn't show up at the hospital, someone must have called the police--
GREER	The police are the last people on earth I'm worried about... Greer pulls a Police Scanner out of his jacket and shows it
GREER (VO)	We get one hit on the scanner about you, we'll be picking out family plots, comprende? Suddenly, a HUMMER, with the BASS THUMPING at ear-shattering Jessica hears it first. The pumping cacophony coming from But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room,
JESSICA	Do you honestly expect me to believe we're going to walk away from this alive? But Greer isn't listening to her. He strides back into the
GREER	Shut up.
JESSICA (VO)	How can I SHUT UP? You threaten to kill my child and you expect me to act like a MUTE?! If this -- Suddenly, it hits Ryan like a punch to the face. And he
RYAN	Oh shit! Where's mute?!
ESSICA	...your child, then-- NIGGAS) they would (my niggas)... As the thumping bass subsides, Ryan sighs with relief. x - ·>
ELLIS	Well?
GREER	The Left Field sports bar at LAX.
ELLIS	Are you positive? Greer ignores him. Then turns to Deason.
GREER	Tell Hodges we move in ten. Deason nods and moves off. Jessica lies on the floor, sobbing into her knees. Jessica...? Answer me, goddamn it I Soon, his voice pierces the suffocating gloom around her and I'm here.
RYAN	You all right?! I thought they-- I'm okay.
RYAN	What are you doing? Why'd you lie to them?
JESSICA	Do you think I like gambling with my son's life?
RYAN	I can't tell. You seem pretty good at it --
JESSICA	Don't you see, Ryan? Once they get Craig, we're all gonna die.
RYAN	You can't know that for sure.
JESSICA	Be realistic. Does letting us live benefit them in any way? No! The only chance he's got is if you can get to the airport and find him before they do.
RYAN	Wait, wait--!
JESSICA	Ryan, please! There's no time! Just get to the airport--
RYAN	It's suicide. They'll kill me! They won't! You're invisible to them! They don't know who you are. They don't know anything about you. Please! You've got to try!
RYAN	Lady, I've jacked two cars, been accused of being a child molester, obliterated a car dealership, and busted three caps in a Verizon store. -- Don't tell me I'm not trying! Jessica tries another tack.
JESSICA	Look, I have no right to ask you this Ryan, but you re my family's only chance...and I am asking. Something in the way she says that last sentence, a mixture
RYAN	I'll get the phone to your husband, but that's gotta be it, okay?!
MOONEY	Ms. Martin?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN	Yes?
MOONEY	Jessica Kate Martin? The Woman nods. Mooney is plainly disillusioned by the
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN	Cam I help you, Officer...? She scans Mooney's badge. Mooney. No. No, I guess not. Must've been a prank. I m sorry to have b9thered you, Ms. Martin. Have a nice day. The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he walks back into the house and flips open her CELLPHONE. When

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN	It's Bayback. Remember the Fusco brothers? Silence.
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (CONT'D)	Well, I've got an itch that needs scatching. Too close to make out who it is just yet--

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)	We're in the middle of a shit storm, and I need you to put a leash put on an officer.
DEEP MALE VOICE	Who?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)	An Officer Mooney from your division. Know him? Now, we start PULLING BACK, revealing the man's features.
DEEP MALE VOICE	Mooney? He's a desk sergeant. What would you want with him? I had to do a B & E and he came snooping around the house looking for the owner.
DEEP MALE VOICE	And what did you say?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)	That I was her, of course. Continue PULLING BACK. We can almost recognize him now...
DEEP MALE VOICE	Did he believe you?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)	I think so. He said he thought someone was pulling a prank on him.
DEEP MALE VOICE	Mooney doing an investigation? What's are you really up to? The man swivels around in his chair and we see clearly it's--
DETECTIVE TOMLIN	And no bullshit. Right now you're entire department's hot, so if I'm gonna get in the tub, I've got to know how deep it is. Where are you now?!
RYAN	I'll be at the airport in twenty minu -- Twenty minutes! Oh my God, Ryan, you've got to drive faster! Please--
RYAN	Jessica, this car has a sewing machine for an engine! I can't go any faster!
JESSICA	Sorry. I just... For Ryan, the silence is deafening. Despite his frantic
RYAN	Jessica... ? There's an emotional beat, then--
JESSICA	Do you think God will forgive me?
RYAN	What do you mean--?
JESSICA	For what I've done... For giving up Craig... Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.
RYAN	Jessica, they have your kid. You had no choice.
JESSICA	I don't know. I don't know...
RYAN	1 know. I heard what they were doing to you over there. You held out for as long as you could.
JESSICA	My son and I are going to die here, Ryan. They already have us. But maybe I could've saved Craig... The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he
RYAN	Jessica, listen to me. I promise you, I'm not going to let that happen. I could care less about your money. I'm risking my life cause I know I'm gonna get you and your family out of this. You hear what I'm sayin'? But the moment is suddenly cut short as a STATICKY VOICE
BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)	-- Yeah, the show just bought me a Cadillac XLR convertible. No, you can't ride in it. Not until you do something with that road kill you call hair. And what's with your makeup? Kabuki Theatre is not in style --

JESSICA (CONT'D)	Wait, Ryan! What about me--?! Ryan searches the car and finds the HANDSET in the armrest. But it's too late. Ryan's already gone. Soon, the Kidnappers break up into two groups: Greer and Ryan heads toward the --
RYAN	Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there. Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd. ...sets off the alarm.
DETECTOR OPERATOR	Excuse me, sir. Would you mind emptying your pockets over here? Confused, Greer does. He lays his wallet on the table, then
DETECTOR OPERATOR (CONT'D)	Code red! Code red! The response she gets is stunning. SECURITY GUARDS jump out
ELLIS	Wait, this is a mistake-- As one, the entire security force POUNCES on Greer and Ellis,

SUPERIOR OFFICER	Run it. Is that your gun?
GREER	--yes. Yes. It's my piece.
SUPERIOR OFFICER	Well, you're supposed to declare it.

CRAIG	What--?
RYAN	Your wife sent me.
CRAIG	She did? But how--?
RYAN	Would you hurry your ass?! You need to hide. They're here, and they're looking for you. They already have your family. Craig looks at him, growing terrified.
RYAN (CONT'D)	In here!
CRAIG	I don't understand--
RYAN	It's okay. She'll explain it to you. Okay, Jessica, I'm handing you over now.
JESSICA	Ryan, you've done so much. I don't know how to repay you... An awkward, emotional pause falls between them.
RYAN	Forget about the cash. Just get you and y9ur son home safely and we'll call it even.
JESSICA	I will. I promise. I know you will. RYAN hands the cellphone over to Craig.
RYAN (CONT'D)	I'm gonna be outside this door. Don't come out unless I get you. Got it?
CRAIG	Okay. Ryan walks out the restroom door as Craig puts the phone to
ELLIS	Nice move. What the hell you bring a gun for?
GREEK	I didn't.
ELLIS	What do you mean?

RYAN	Shit! Make a scene and you'll never see your family again. Now who's here with you? Craig's eyes swell with fear.
CRAIG	Who, what?... No one! Nobody!
GREER	Answer me! Greer looks around the crowded airport.
CRAIG	I'll forget I saw anything, just leave them alone! Whatever. Greer manhandles Craig toward the exit.
GREER	For your family's sake, you better not have done anything stupid. RYAN snatches the phone from the bogus Craig Martin -- and
GREER AND ELLIS	who scan the crowd bulling their way through throngs of

GREER	Animals? Ellis whips a burlap hood over Craig's head and they drive Yes. He said you looked distracted when you left. He wants you to relax, Bob. He said they found that kid you were looking for and that you were right, it was all a prank. Nothing to worry about.
MOONEY	Yeah, I know. She pulls him back down for another kiss.
MARILYN	What am I gonna do with you?
MOONEY	You're gonna dance with me all night long, until we're too pooped to pop... Well almost. A giggle. They kiss.
MARILYN	You'll never change.
MOONEY	Yes I will, after I shower. They both share a laugh.

JESSICA	No, don't hurt him! Jessica struggles and, with an annoyed shove, Greer sends her
CRAIG	Ricky...? Jessica nods gravely. He's here, too. Craig looks at his
CRAIG (CONT'D)	Oh, God, Jess... What have they done to you? But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity.
JESSICA	Who are they, Craig? Craig doesn't know what to say.
JESSICA (CONT'D)	Tell them, Craig. Tell them they have the wrong family. Tell them they've made a mistake-- But something in his eyes disagrees. What?! What is it?
.u CRAIG	This isn't a mistake, Jess. And that's all it takes for Jessica's world to shatter.
GREEK	Where is the disc now? Blood trickles from the corner of Craig's mouth.
CRAIG	You have to promise. If I give it to you... you'll let my family go.
GREER	I'll tell you what, you tell me where it is-- --and I won't blow her brains all over you right now. Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek.
GREEK (CONT'D)	Your call Craig. It's an eighty-five ''cent bullet to me.
CRAIG	Okay. Enough, you win. But if anything-
GREER	Just shut up and talk. He listens some more, then covers the phone's mouthpiece and
CRAIG (V.O.)	I dropped it down the mail chute at work. It's gotta be in the mailroom.
JESSICA (VO)	You hid it downtown? Change of plans. I need to get to downtown fast.
GREEK	Get up. We're going.
CRAIG	How will I know she's okay?
HODGES	Move! When he gets near the door, Jessica is overcome with emotion
JESSICA	Wait! WAIT!! She brushes past Hodges and hugs on tight to her husband, Hodges goes to pull them apart, but Greer stops him. He
CRAIG	I love you. Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a
JESSICA	Pretend I'm telling you that I love you. There's an open phone line in here. You'll have help at the office, but if you give these men what they want, we're dead. Jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws, leaving

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR	Anything I can help you with Mr. Martin?
CRAIG	Hey, Benny. This might sound ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD mailer into the chute this morning and I forgot to put down an address.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR	Happens all the time. Let me see what's back there. Gimme a sec'. The Supervisor disappears into the back room. Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir? Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is
RYAN	Me?
MAIL CLERK	You waiting for a package? Now everyone's looking at Ryan. Including Greer.
RYAN	Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick something up for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure.
MAIL CLERK	From what department?
RYAN	I'm not sure... They said it was a contract, though, I know that, so what would that be, Legal?
MAIL CLERK	What's the tracking number?
RYAN	Uh... Right. Tracking number. It's looking grim. Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR	Mr. Martin? I found a number of things that could be what you're looking for. Mind coming back to take a look? Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".
CRAIG	Sure. The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room.
RYAN	I might... Maybe it's on the clipboard on my bike? Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and I, uh, may need to call somebody.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR	Help yourself. HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers, A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'.
CRAIG	This is it. Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over
HODGES	Let's go.
RYAN	You believe this? Everyone's got their head up their ass over there. The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to.
MAIL CLERK	Sir? You think you could just go outside and get your clipboard? Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.
MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)	Sir? Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone. It's now or never. Ryan has to do something.
MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)	Sir!?
RYAN	Screw the package. Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a -- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!! Hodges Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their Craig does. But Ryan grabs him and moves, racing out of the

DETECTIVE TOMLIN	What the hell, Moon? It's all over the radio.
MOONEY	Jack, she didn't identify herself.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN	What are you saying?
MOONEY	I shot a cop! Dana Bayback. From the 23rd. She was one of the kidnappers. Tomlin looks stunned by the revelation.

RYAN	Shut up and listen to me, asswipe. I got what you want. Who is this?
RYAN	You know who this is, shithead!
TELEMARKETER	Look, sir, we can take your name off our list if you want, but you don't have to get nasty-- What--? Who is this?
TELEMARKETER	Mark. At Mastercharge Credit Union- *59 A frickin' telemarketer? But I 159 just hit "Last Incoming Call"-- Ryan suddenly puts it together. You bastard. The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly.

GREER VO	He's with you? How'd he find out?
TOMLIN	Said something about a kid who came into the station earlier-- Greer grimaces, putting it together.
GREER	Early twenties? Stumbled out of Brian Wilson's hamper?
TOMLIN	Yeah. Something like that.
GREER	Tomlin. Take care of him. No witnesses. That's more than Tomlin bargained for.
TOMLIN	Are you sure that's necessary, sir?
GREER	You know once the shitstorm starts, there's nothing I can do to save you.

RYAN	Just the woman and her kid.
GREER	Who are you? What's your name? My name is F you. I've got your shit, pal, it doesn't work that way.
GREEK	Really? Go cut the kid's throat. Though Ryan's eyes widen in panic, his voice remains cool.
RYAN	Fine. Your loss. Nice talking to you. And Ryan hangs up. He waits nervously, sweating, staring at

GREER	So, how do you want to do this?
RYAN	Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile, apologize to the kid and the woman and bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier.
GREER (VO)	No. Somewhere quieter.
RYAN	Dude, you're lucky I'm still talkin' to your sorry ass. You do as I say, exactly as I say, or I hang up now and slap this bitch on Nightline, you know what I'm sayin'? There's a long beat.
GREER (VO)	Fine. But you come alone.
RYAN	Done. How will I recognize you?
RYAN	You let me worry about that. What's your cell number? (310) 555-8342. An hour then?
RYAN	I can hardly wait. Ryan hangs up. A scared, but satisfied smile...
MOONEY	Shouldn't we be on Pico? To the right, some PEOPLE wait for a bus. Tomlin turns left.
TOMLIN	County will have a six hour wait. Ten if they know you're a cop. Mooney grunts his gratitude as Tomlin heads toward a Tomlin's cellphone RINGS! He lowers the gun and answers the Yeah?
GREER (OS)	Is it taken care of?
TOMLIN	Not yet.
GREER (OS)	Good. We're making a trade with the kid at the Santa Monica Pier. Your boy can ID the kid for us. Bring him down.
TOMLIN	I'm on it. Tomlin flips his phone closed and turns the car around.
TOMLIN (CONT'D)	We caught a break with the kid. He's been spotted on the pier. Think you can hang on a little longer? Just enough to ID the kid before we patch you up? Mooney clearly doesn't want to say "no." But it hurts. Whaddaya say? Up to you. Beat.
MOONEY	Let's solve the goddamn thing. With all the CHEERING, DANCING and DRINKING going on, it's
ENVIOUS COLLEGE KID	Lucky bastard...
RYAN	You like it? Happy Birthday. THUD. The Friends' jaws hit the ground. And as they run to Inside, Hodges sits behind the wheel; Jessica and Ricky lay Hodges lifts his Nextel and thumbs the button.
HODGES	I'm in position.
GREEK	Copy.
GREER	Only take the kid out if it's clean. No guess work. The last thing we need's a stampede. Greer paces anxiously -- when suddenly his Nextel RINGS. He
GREER (CONT'D)	You here? Yeah.
GREER	How do you want to do this?
RYAN (VO)	First show me that Jessica and the kid are okay.
GREER	Do you have the disc? Yes. Where are they?
GREER	See the black van at the bottom of the bridge? Passenger side window.
RYAN (VO)	Hang on. Okay, got it. Greer muffles the phone against his leg. Whispers to Ellis:
GREER	He's within visual of the car. Greer takes his police walkie and toggles it. Hodges, show the woman. Lower the passenger side window only.
GREER (INTO PHONE)	Did you see that? Yes. Greer muffles the phone again. Whispers to Ellis.
GREER	He's around the passenger side. Have you found him yet? No. I don't know what the hell he looks like!
GREER	He's the one on the cellphone, you idiot 1
ELLIS (VO)	Everyone's on a cellphone! I've got like fifty possible targets here! Ellis' cross hairs flit from one person on a cell, to
GREER	Your turn. Now you show me something.
RYAN (VO)	No. Put them on the Ferris wheel. I want to see them safe first.
GREER	That wasn't part of the deal. Deal's changed.
RYAN (VO)	I've been thinking. Does me no good to hand over the DVD and then you and the funky bunch take us out. I swore I wouldn't do that.
RYAN	Like you swore to protect and serve? The reference brings Greer up short. There's a moment, then:
GREER	You know a lot...
RYAN	And I'll forget a lot, too. But not until they're both out of danger. Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the
RYAN (CONT'D)	Your choice, man. The Martins or the DVD. Either way, I'm not hanging around any longer. You got five seconds, then I disconnect your ass. You sure you know what you're doing?
RYAN	One... Two... On the other end of the phone:
RYAN	Three... Four... --but Ryan's got him by the balls. Angrily, Greer lifts his
GREER	Okay! Okay. Hodges, put 'em on the Ferris wheel. What? I
GREER	Shut up and do it!
RYAN	Not bad. Most people never get past two. Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him.
GREER	Keep an eye on them. As soon as we make the trade, take the woman and her kid out.
GREER (VO)	Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live long enough to enjoy it.
RYAN	Oooh, I think I just pissed myself. Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back
CHLOE	There you are! Where the hell were you! ?
RYAN	Chloe! Get away from here!
CHLOE	Know how many hours I waited for you to bring back those stupid shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them on the Prominade yourself--? But Ryan's got no time for this.
MOONEY	That's him! There he is!
RYAN	It isn't safe to talk, get it? I -- People are after me!
CHLOE	What -- are you high? Suddenly, Mooney steps up beside Ryan and grabs him.
MOONEY	I've been..looking for..you, kid-- But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys.
RYAN	Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!
	GREER's pissed. Pacing on the roof, when: I've got him! Instantly, Greer jams the walkie to his face, and we--
GREER (OVER WALKIE)	Hodges, do not let them go! Do you hear me? Do not let them go! In the heat of battle, Ryan's cellphone clatters by Chloe' s
MOONEY	Jesus, kid, calm down!! Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing--
CHLOE	Oh my God-- Someone call 911! A CROWD starts to gather when -- Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back. Tomlin's

Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of For all the trouble you've caused, you'd better have that goddamned disc. Where is it?

RYAN	Think! Think!
CHLOE	You better lie still. The paramedics should be here shortly. But Mooney's obstinate. He rises despite her best efforts.
MOONEY	Just keep that ambulance close by. And as he stumbles off--
TOMLIN	You're wounded kid, just give me what I came for, and I'll let you all go. Police sirens in the distance grow louder. Tomlin's offer goes unanswered. That's when he notices the He's gonna have to search this whole place-- Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone, SFX: Nearby, Ryan's cellphone starts to RING, betraying him!
TOMLIN	Shoulda stayed at home this morning, kid. And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing-- Funny. I was about to say the same to you.
TOMLIN	What the-- And in the instant Tomlin realizes he's been tricked, he

GREER (CONT'D)	This is about to be the most enjoyable part of an extremely shitty day. And just as he's about to pull the trigger --
JESSICA	Tell me why I shouldn't kill you. For the first time, Greer actually looks frightened. Ryan, weak and pale with blood loss, looks up at his guardian
