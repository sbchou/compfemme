ETHAN	You don't like me? You hate me? is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes.
	Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone.
	What do you feel about me?
SUPERGIRL	I...I don't know. This is all so sudden.
	There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

ETHAN	me kiss you.
	No.
ETHAN	You're not afraid are you?
SUPERGIRL	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

	That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
	cheap trick.
SUPERGIRL	but effective.
	
	Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope.
BIANCA	Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
SELENA	Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
	Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?
SELENA	don't feel like it right now.
BIANCA	She didn't take it from you, did she?
SELENA	That little girl? Ha. Now go on, get me some tools.
	There's no need. I learned the Craft from my grandmother.
	f'kah s'koo...
	Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of seven.

SELENA	There you are. Come to mama.
	I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
ETHAN	paradise . We could be very happy here.
	But I have to go back. I brought you here so be safe. From her.
ETHAN	can't just abandon me. Alone.
	stay for a while.
	Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
SUPERGIRL	I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
	Well, maybe a little longer than that.

ELDERLY MAN	of course not.
SELENA	Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.
IN UNISON	Circle is complete.
NIGEL	better have a pretty good explanation for Selena.

INDIAN WOMAN	Superman has been away.
SELENA	is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She we exist..
ELDERLY MAN	she must be destroyed.
NIGEL	did she find out about us?
ELDERLY MAN	is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will curious and learn more. When she learns plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet avenge the centuries of persecution---she will to stop us.
BIANCA	must destroy her first.
ERICA	how can we destroy her?
	By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must to take on the combined power of us all.
	You want to take our power for yourself! reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.
SELENA	Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.
SELENA	Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
NIGEL	You would! You revealed our existence so you could all of our power.
SELENA	you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself,
NIGEL	get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart.
SELENA	
	quibbling. Let us vote.
SELENA	I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree? speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence.
	have no choice.
SUPERGIRL	Ethan, what IS wrong?
ETHAN	She said it wouldn't last.
	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
ETHAN	I don't love you any more.
	like that?
ETHAN	turning off a light.
ETHAN	I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that talk.
	are you going?
	From you.
SUPERGIRL	why?
	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
SUPERGIRL	I sort of like what you said.
ETHAN	That makes it worse.
SUPERGIRL	But I don't understand. stops and stares at her for a moment.
ETHAN	Of course you don't. We're from two different remember?
	At last. Ultimate Power.
BIANCA	And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
SELENA	What do you mean we? turns on the kneeling six. They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.
	Hi.
SUPERGIRL	Hello. Are you still mad at me?
ETHAN	I'm not mad at you.
SUPERGIRL	It seemed that way to me.
ETHAN	I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
SUPERGIRL	what?
	What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I up and found part of me wasn't there any more: that made me feel really alive and aware of It was like, for the first time in my life, everything together perfectly---you and me and the world us--like we were a wonderful song...
	And now?
ETHAN	And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
SUPERGIRL	don It know much about these things, but maybe you had that feeling once...it can, come back.
ETHAN	think so?
SUPERGIRL	don't see why not.
ETHAN	what if---it wasn't real?
	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours
ETHAN	Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we get together every now and then and see each And maybe something might. happen again. do you think?
SUPERGIRL	you asking me for a "date"?
	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm---
SUPERGIRL	you forgetting about Selena?
ETHAN	forget about us eventually.
	something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
ETHAN	know what it is. She has this lead container shaped a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
SUPERGIRL	That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
ETHAN	this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better away from there.
SUPERGIRL	can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't the Power Source at the amusement park.
ETHAN	Wait. Don't leave me.

SUPERGIRL	
ETHAN	one kiss. For old times' sake.
SUPERGIRL	you can see how you feel about me, right?
ETHAN	
SUPERGIRL	Ethan!

	I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. warned us. Wouldn't listen to him.
SUPERGIRL	are you talking about? Where's Selena?
	No. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her. Hurt you.
	have to find her. Tell me.
	Supergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain. her before it's too late!
ETHAN	I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
SELENA	I could force you.
ETHAN	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, want me to drink it of my own free will. Well me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell I fall for that one again.
SELENA	on, talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
	You've been without water for a whole day. Let's how thirsty you get in a week.
ETHAN	vicious--
SELENA	don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry. glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away. the garden.
	I told you I'd win.
	Kiss me. grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape.
	Ethan!
	Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever.
	Ethan! Don't let her do this!
	No. It isn't true.
ALURA'S VOICE	where are you?
KARA	I can hardly hear you.
ALURA. S VOICE	You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared the scanners...
	I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. I'm weak.
ALURA'S VOICE	you must not give up. We must retrieve the Source. The City is dying.
KARA	Then send someone else. I failed.
ALURA'S VOICE	We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no have the power to push through.
	But Mother, I'm lost.
ALURA' S VOICE	must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . .
	tried. I really tried. sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone.
	Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!
	I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And bring you myself as her representative here Earth.
	From this moment forth, all science, religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I teach the One True Way of our ancient
President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to	Selena.
PRESIDENT	You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we it.
SELENA	it's about time too.
PRESIDENT	do not know who you are, or what evil force represent, but it will take more than a threats from you to make mankind turn back clock and abandon thousands of years of progress.
	Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. have something better.
	Zaltar.
	Kara? Is it you?
ZALTAR	is the Phantom Zone. But why did you here from Argo City?
SUPERGIRL	was on Earth...
ZALTAR	You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
SUPERGIRL	I went there to find the lost Power Source...
ZALTAR	done that.
SUPERGIRL	the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me the Phantom Zone.
ZALTAR	dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can all sorts of terrible forces---
SUPERGIRL	know.
ZALTAR	nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. can stay with me, until I build you your own I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- our type of people.
SUPERGIRL	Others?
ZALTAR	Criminals.
ZALTAR	A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid And you should too.
	pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
ZALTAR	Palace? Hardly.
SUPERGIRL	feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
	Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. try something new.
	lovely. . .
ZALTAR	no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything right. Nobody telling you to change this, that around. Please yourself. That's secret of happiness.
SUPERGIRL	you happy, Zaltar?
	What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do I want. All the time.
SUPERGIRL	what about other people? Don't you miss them?
ZALTAR	I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.
	You look at them? How?
ZALTAR	The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you the right tools.
	There you see? What could be more boring than that? waves his hand, and the image disappears.
	Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?
ZALTAR	It'll only make you sad.
ZALTAR	This goes closer. This moves it around. And begins.
SECRETARY	No more audiences today. Go home. All you.
	They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
ETHAN	Yeah.
	Coming?
SELENA	Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, Prince Ethan now.
	horrible woman!
ZALTAR	you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would you sad.
	No. I have to see this.
	I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers been arrested!
JIMMY	How do you know?
LUCY	I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
JIMMY	anybody notice you?
LUCY	can't help it if men notice me.
JIMMY	Be serious. We could be executed for treason!
	kidding. Nobody saw me.
	I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't any of this go on. Not for one minute.
LUCY	wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
	I heard stories. I don't think you wanna know.
	Ethan!
ETHAN	
	Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
ETHAN .	Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.
LUCY	Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here?
ETHAN	A little.
LUCY	Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We they were selling hamburgers in that place.
ETHAN	mention it upstairs.
JIMMY	The blonde girl who saved your life---where she now?
	She's gone. No one will ever see her again.
	please help me.
ZALTAR	course, my dear. What can I do?
SUPERGIRL	me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. need me. looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.
ZALTAR	There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. why they send the criminals here.
	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
ZALTAR	No, that's not true---there's well...no--
	is a way.
SUPERGIRL	knew it!
ZALTAR	it's impossible.
SUPERGIRL	
ZALTAR	it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it. heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.
ZALTAR	I could do it. is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.
	teach me how.
ZALTAR	it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a of this? It's delicious, I think. takes another sip of his drink.
	me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can. looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.
	Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a of life--can also take away life; works backwards Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's of the question.
SUPERGIRL	come with me.
ZALTAR	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
SUPERGIRL	You could do anything. You could sculpt ranges...draw with rainbows! have superpowers.
ZALTAR	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
SUPERGIRL	I have to get back to Earth. My friends are trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Argo City will die.
	all right. Stop crying. Let's go.
	You're going to take me back?
ZALTAR	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
	I heard my mother ask you once "how could a with such a selfish heart create beauty?" was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous
ZALTAR	doing this for you. Just sick of this place, all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling you. Boring!
	Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
	I did.
LUCY	Well thanks a pile, fella.
	going on?
	Go on.
	I don't know. You seem afraid.
SELENA	You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
ETHAN	Supergirl?
	Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes. eyes.
ETHAN	You're not going to hurt her, are you?
	You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
ETHAN	Well...I guess I can't.
SELENA	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
	Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the will drop them one by one.
	Why the empty cage?
	one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd to lose you, Ethan.
	What...?
SELENA	You don't get this far without paying...a price.
DANVERS	If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her.
. DANVERS	not afraid to die. I'm proud of you.
JIMMY	been in love with you for years. Remember you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? put your fingerprints on my lens.
	Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're

LUCY	bet your ass.
JIMMY	didn't you tell me?
LUCY	supposed to guess. reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers.
SUPERGIRL	Why are you stopping?
ZALTAR	Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you do.
	Oh dear!
	wand. Use it.
ZALTAR	Good girl! That's the way!
ZALTAR	You can use the wand.
SUPERGIRL	Better than when I was a child. hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.
	I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like mother.
	What's that? Never saw anything like that.
SUPERGIRL	Don't stop. Keep moving.
ZALTAR	mustn't stop.
SUPERGIRL	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
	Use the wand!
	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
	
SUPERGIRL	
	You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.
	Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart.
	Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.
	You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
ETHAN	has hostages.
SELENA	Danvers. And two of your little friends.
SUPERGIRL	just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
	Hey, what gives?
	All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till last card's dealt.
	You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
SELENA	Not yet.
	It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
	How do I fight it?
ETHAN	Turn it against her.
SELENA	Power of Shadow, kill her!!
SELENA	I am your mistress. Do not harm me.
SELENA	listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.
SECOND SELENA	are my shadow, you must obey me.
	I've got it! The Power Source!
SELENA	Stop! Please! hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.
ETHAN	It is you, then, really?
SELENA	Well?
	It's you all right.
SECOND SELENA	I'll make it easy for you.
ETHAN	I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.
SUPERGIRL	I never doubted you for a moment.
REAL SELENA	Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...
	I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
	For what? points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.
	Ever since I found that thing I've been like prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
	Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to City where it won't be misused. could come too. It might be safer for you.
	No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll for me. I figure I might get a million bucks my memoirs.
SUPERGIRL	I'll come back as soon as I can.
SELENA	What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around
	She's right. They'll string her up.
	Do you want to come to Argo City?
	What's it like?
	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
	Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the through inner space.
	is inner space?
	It's everywhere. But water is always door.
	Will they be angry with me for the Power Source?
SUPERGIRL	be grateful. If you hadn't found it would still be lost. Look, up ahead. Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
SUPERGIRL	That's home.
