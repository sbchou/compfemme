ALLNUT	Hello, Reverend.
BROTHER	Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Here's your mail. Sorry I'm late, but one thing and another kept me in Limbasi. You know how it is, Reverend. Or maybe you don't.
ALLNUT	They gave me a real going over when I got to the mine. They called me all the names they could think of -- in Belgian, but I don't mind so much bein' cursed in a foreign language, so I just took it with a smile. They wouldn't fire me, I was sure of that. There ain't nobody in Central Africa but yours truly knows how to get up a head of steam on The African Queen. It may sound like bragging, Reverend, but I'm mighty close to being in-di- spensable. Seein's how them Belgians is too damn cheap to buy 'er a new engine.
ROSE	Good morning, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Mornin', Miss.
BROTHER	Ah, splendid, At last they've come.
ALLNUT	Huh?
BROTHER	My marrow seed.
BROTHER	Yes. Yes?
OLD WOMAN	Oh Mistah Sayuh, I does like how you preach!
BROTHER	'k you?
OLD WOMAN	All dat hell-fish!
OLD WOMAN	De way yo' neck swell up.
BROTHER	Thank you, thank you. You'll stop for tea, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Don't care if I do.
ROSE	You take sugar, Mr. Allnutt, I seem to remember.
ALLNUT	That's right, Miss. Couple o'spoonfuls.
ROSE	And cream.
ALLNUT	Right.
ROSE	Bread and butter?
ALLNUT	'oh obliged.
BROTHER	'k you?
ALLNUT	Just listen to that stomick of mine.
ALLNUT	Way it sounds, you'd think I'd got an 'eye-ener inside me.
ROSE	Do have another cup of tea, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Thanks, Miss, don't mind if I do.
ALLNUT	Scuse me.
ALLNUT	Much obliged, Miss.
ALLNUT	Queer thing, ain't it. Wot I mean, wot d'you spose it is, makes a man's stomick carry on like that?
ROSE	Bread and butter, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	Thanks, Miss.
BROTHER	Herbie Morton's a bishop.
ALLNUT	Huh?
ROSE	Who's that, dear?
BROTHER	Surely you remember Herbie Morton. Blond, ruddy-complected chap, a bit younger than me. He sang a solo at the graduation exercises. "Holy, Holy", I believe.
ROSE	I think I remember. It was so long ago.
BROTHER	Well, he's a bishop now.
ROSE	Splendid.
BROTHER	I'd say Herbie was a bit younger than I -- four or five years. Surprising in a way. I mean -- well, there was nothing outstanding about him. He was no great shakes as a student and he didn't have any more than his share of the social graces. butter, but with No doubt one does get ahead quicker at home than in a foreign field... And then, of course, he did marry well.
ROSE	Oh!
BROTHER	That manufacturer's widow. What was his name? Briggs -- Griggs -- Briggs -- yes, Alfred Briggs. Soap flakes, I think. Yes, Mrs. Alfred Briggs. Not to take anything away from Herbie. I am delighted for him.
ROSE	Of course.
BROTHER	It was "Holy, Holy."
ROSE	Yes.
ALLNUT	There ain't a thing I can do about it.
ROSE	More tea, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	No, Miss, I reckon not. About time I shoved off, if I'm gonna get back to the mine by tomorra night.
ROSE	Don't hurry, Mr. Allnutt.
BROTHER	Stay for dinner.
ALLNUT	Thanks all the same.
BROTHER	Mr. Allnutt brought the marrow seed at last.
ROSE	Splendid.
BROTHER	I must say, though, they were forever getting here.
ALLNUT	Lucky they come through now, cause it don't look like they'll be no more mail for a while.
BROTHER	Why not?
ALLNUT	Reckon the Germans'll hold it up.
BROTHER	In heaven's name why?
ALLNUT	Cause it looks like there's a war on.
BROTHER	No. Really? Where, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	Europe.
BROTHER	Indeed! Between whom?
ALLNUT	Oh, Germany, England, the whole --
BROTHER AND ROSE	England!!
ALLNUT	Right.
BROTHER	You mm -- you really mean war?
ALLNUT	Wot they tell me. Germans claim the British started it. British claim it was the Germans. In any case, it's war.
ROSE	But what's happened! What do you know about it!
BROTHER	Rose! Exactly, Mr. Allnutt, what has happened?
ALLNUT	Well, now, that's about all I can remember. Oh yes -- France is in it, too. She's with us, I fink. A lot 'o them little countries are in it too -- Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium -- I forget 'oo's with 'oom.
BROTHER	And that is all you can tell us?
ALLNUT	All I know. -- I'll try to pick up some more, next trip to Limbasi.
BROTHER	I wonder to what extent we here shall be affected.
ALLNUT	None, I shouldn't think.
BROTHER	This is German territory.
ALLNUT	Why would they want to bother a poor devil of a missionary and his maiden sister? -- beggin' your pardons.
BROTHER	We are enemy aliens.
ALLNUT	Wot's the difference -- in this God- forsaken place?
ROSE	God has not forgotten this place, Mr. Allnutt -- as my brother's presence here bears witness.
ALLNUT	No offence, Miss.
BROTHER	Really war.
ALLNUT	Looks like it... Well, I better shove off now. Many thanks for the tea.
ALLNUT	Well, take care of yerselves. See ya next month.
BROTHER	Goodbye. And thank you.
ALLNUT	'Bye, Miss.
ROSE	Goodbye, Mr. Allnutt.
ROSE	Shouldn't we perhaps call him back? Get to Limbasi while we can?
BROTHER	The good shepherd does not forsake his flock when wolves prowl. Besides, I think Allnutt is very probably right... I can't imagine any reason why the Germans should trouble us.
ROSE	No, I suppose not.
BROTHER	War. England. Just think!
NATIVE	Mistah Sayuh! Mistah Sayuh!
NATIVE'S VOICE	Mistah! Oh Mistah Sayuh!
BROTHER'S VOICE	the Germans are up Rose -- go indoors and stay there.
BROTHER	What is the meaning of this outrage!
OFFICER	Speak German, please; I speak no English.
BROTHER	No!
ROSE	squatting beside him, turning his Judkins!
BROTHER	jaw not broken but No. No.
ROSE	Oh, Judkins. Brother dear. Come, dear. Come, Brother.
BROTHER	No! No, Lord! O no! O no! Lord! No! O no!
BROTHER	Why aren't you dressed, Rose? It's time for Service.
ROSE	You must wear your hat!
BROTHER	Time, this minute!
ROSE	You must lie down a bit. You're not at all well.
BROTHER	But it's time. It's time.
ROSE	You're not well enough. Lie down a bit, dear.
BROTHER	Perhaps I should. I feel rather odd.
ROSE	I'll help you off with your things.
BROTHER	Rose.
BROTHER	'k you?
ROSE	Brother! Brother dear!
BROTHER	Smite them, Lord! Smite the Amalekites, hip and thigh!
ROSE	Amen.
BROTHER	So cold and so foggy. My eyes are so tired. Where is Rose? Rose, are you down there in the shop? Rose, bring me a cup of hot tea.
ROSE	I'm here with you, Brother dear. Right here beside you.
BROTHER	I try to study -- so hard. I haven't had the start some have: 'Ebrew; Greek -- no -- facility. If only there were more time. Well, if I can't pass the examinations, I can volunteer. I can be a missionary. Rose, too. Not comely among maidens, but she can become a servant in the house of the Lord. Yes, even for such as she, God finds a goodly use.
BROTHER	I'm going to put my books away, Rose. I'm not going to study any more. If I don't pass, it only means that God has other work for me. Thy will be done. But, Lord, if it be Thy Will, O let me distinguish myself and give me a call here in England, right here at home, Lord. Mother will be so proud, Lord. Abash and put to shame all them that revile me and persecute me for Thy Name's sake. Lord, I have tried so hard.
ROSE	Come in, Mr. Allnutt.
ROSE	Thank God you've come.
ROSE	(o.S.) Sit down, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Don't mind if I do.
ALLNUT	So they got here afore I did, eh?
ROSE	Yes, they got here. Just after you left.
ALLNUT	No!
ALLNUT	Couldn't a been more wrong, could I? Bout the Germans.
ROSE	Burning villages.
ALLNUT	That's to keep the natives from runnin' away. No place to come back to. Been doin' it all over, they told me up at Limbasi. The Germans are gonna train 'em into an army and try to take over the whole of Africa.
ROSE	Poor helpless natives!
ALLNUT	It was the same up at the mine when I got back from Limbasi. A clean sweep of everything. Just plain luck I was on the river. They could certainly use my launch and what's in 'er, too. Blastin' gelatine, Miss. Eight boxes of it. An' a lot of canned grub. An' cylinders of oxygen an' hydrogen for that weldin' job on the crusher. Lots o' stuff.
ROSE	Oh, trust them.
ALLNUT	But as it 'appens, I got the stuff -- an' the launch. Only I've got no crew, an' she ain't an easy boat to run single-'anded. Cause them two boys o' mine just skipped in the night. Don't know if they were scared o' me or the Germans.
ROSE	They are fiends out of hell... His whole life's work smashed. Ruined. In a few minutes.
ALLNUT	The Reverend, eh? Where's 'e now, Miss?
ROSE	He's dead.
ALLNUT	I say, that's too bad! Pretty rough on you, Miss. What'd 'e die of, Miss?
ROSE	They killed him.
ALLNUT	Well, now that's just awful! If they'll up and shoot a Reverend, who couldn't do 'em a bit a 'arm, there ain't nobody safe.
ROSE	They didn't shoot him, Mr. Allnutt. But they are accountable to God just as surely as if they had.
ALLNUT	'Ow d'you mean, Miss?
ROSE	They broke his heart. He didn't take care of himself. He didn't want to live.
ALLNUT	Well, Miss that's cert'nly too bad, that's all I can say. he is uneasy in the silence. Making When'd 'e die, Miss?
ROSE	Early this morning. He's in there.
ALLNUT	Hey!
ROSE	I beg your pardon?
ALLNUT	'Scuse it, Miss. Wot I mean to say is -- the climate 'n all -- quicker you get 'im under ground the better, if you don't mind me sayin' so.
ALLNUT	Got a shovel?
ROSE	Behind the bungalow.
ALLNUT	Right. -- Tell ya wot. While I'm diggin' the grave, you get yer things together, Miss -- all the things ya want to take. Then we can clear out of 'ere.
ROSE	Clear out?
ALLNUT	Germans might come back any time.
ROSE	Why should they? They left nothing.
ALLNUT	Oh, they'll come back, all right. Lookin' for The African Queen. They'd dearly love to get their 'ooks on 'er. She's the only power boat on the river.
ROSE	Where will we go?
ALLNUT	I thought, Miss, 'ow we might find somewhere quiet behind an island. Then we could talk about what to do.
ROSE	I'll get my things ready.
ALLNUT	Fine, Miss, I'll be quick's I can.
ROSE	Thank you, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	You'd do the same for me, Miss.
ALLNUT	Well, Miss, let's get outa here while the gettin's good.
ROSE	It was very kind of you, Mr. Allnutt, to think of the cross.
ALLNUT	Shucks. Just seemed like he oughta have one, him a Reverend 'n all.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Careful now, Miss. Watch your step. That's right.
ROSE	a little as if he had passed her a Thank -- you? restrainedly, as if a little critical of a parlor somewhat
ALLNUT	'Scuse me, Miss.
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Yerss...?
ROSE	What are the chances of our getting out through Limbasi on the railway to the Coast?
ALLNUT	The railway was in German 'ands when I was in Limbasi -- and by this time Limbasi is too, I'll bet.
ROSE	Then how do we get out, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	You got me, Miss. We've got 'eaps of grub 'ere, Miss, so we're all right, far as that goes. Two thousand cigarettes, two cases of gin. We could find a good 'iding place an' stay there for months if we want to.
ALLNUT	I spose there's goin' to be a fight. If our troops come from the sea, they'll attack up the railway to Limbasi, I spose. In that case, the best thing we could do would be to wait round down 'ere an' just go up to Limbasi when the time came. -- On the other 'and, they might come down from British East, an' if they do that we'd 'ave the Germans between us and them all the time. Same if they came from Rhodesia or Portuguese East. We're in a bit of a fix, whichever way y'look at it, Miss. Mind takin' the tiller, Miss?
ALLNUT	Port a little, Miss.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Pull it over this side, I mean. -- That's it! Steady!
ALLNUT	So far so good. 'Ere we are safe an' sound, as you might say. Not too bad a spot, is it, Miss, to sit a war out in? All the comforts of 'ome, includin' runnin' water.
ROSE	I'm afraid, Mr. Allnutt, that what you suggest is quite impossible.
ALLNUT	'Ave you got any ideas? 'Ere's a map, Miss. Show me the way out an' I'll take it.
ALLNUT	One thing sure; our men won't come up from the Congo, not even if they want to. They'd 'ave to cross the lake, and nothin' won't cross the lake while The Louisa is there.
ROSE	The Louisa? What's that?
ALLNUT	It's an 'undred-ton German steamer, Miss, and she's the boss o' the lake 'cause she's got a six-pounder.
ROSE	What's that?
ALLNUT	A gun, Miss. The biggest gun in Central Africa.
ROSE	I see.
ALLNUT	If it wasn't for The Louisa, there wouldn't be nothin' to it. The Germans couldn't last a month if our men could get across the lake... But all this doesn't get us any nearer 'ome, does it, Miss? Believe me, if I could think wot we could do...
ROSE	This river, the Ulanga, runs into the lake, doesn't it?
ALLNUT	Well, Miss, it does; but if you was thinkin' of goin' to the lake in this launch -- well, you needn't think about it any more. We can't and that's certain.
ROSE	Why not?
ALLNUT	Rapids, Miss. Cataracts and gorges. There's an 'undred miles of rapids down there. Why, the river's even got a different nyme where it comes out on the lake to what it's called up 'ere. It's the Bora down there. No one knew they was the same river until that chap Spengler --
ROSE	He got down it. I remember.
ALLNUT	Yes, Miss, in a dugout canoe. 'E 'ad half a dozen Swahili paddlers. Map makin', 'e was. In fact, that's 'is map you're lookin' at. There's places where this ole river goes shootin' down there like out of a fire 'ose. We couldn't never get this ole launch through.
ROSE'S VOICE	Mr. Allnutt --
ALLNUT	Yes, Miss.
ROSE	What did you say is in these boxes with the red lines on them?
ALLNUT	That's blastin' gelatine, Miss.
ROSE	Isn't it dangerous?
ALLNUT	Bless you, no, Miss, that's safety stuff, that is. It can get wet and not do any 'arm. If you set fire to it, it just burns. You can 'it it wiv an 'ammer and it won't go off -- at least I don't fink it will. It takes a detonator to set it off. I'll put it over the side if it worries you though.
ROSE	No. We may need it.
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt --
ALLNUT	Yeah?
ROSE'S VOICE	And what are these queer long round things?
ALLNUT	Them's the oxygen and hydrogen cylinders, Miss. Ain't no good to us, though. Next time I shift cargo, I'll dump 'em.
ROSE	I wouldn't do that.
ROSE	They look like -- like torpedoes.
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt --
ALLNUT	I'm still right here, Miss, and on a thirty-foot boat there ain't much of any place else I could be.
ROSE	You're a machinist, aren't you? Wasn't that your position at the mine?
ALLNUT	Yeah, kind of fixer. Jack of all trades and master o' none, like they say.
ROSE	Could you make a torpedo?
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Come again, Miss?
ROSE	Could you make a torpedo.
ALLNUT	You don't really know what you're askin', Miss. It's this way, you see. A torpedo is a very complicated piece of machinery what with gyroscopes an' compressed air chambers an' vertical and horizontal rudders an' compensating weights. Why, a torpedo costs at least a thousand pounds to make.
ROSE	But all those things, those gyroscopes and things, they're only to make it go, aren't they?
ALLNUT	Uh-huh. Go -- and hit what it's goin' after.
ROSE	words triumphant and Well! We've got The African Queen.
ROSE	If we put this -- this blasting stuff -- in the front of the boat here -- and a -- what did you say -- deno -- detonator there, why that would be a torpedo, wouldn't it?
ROSE'S VOICE	Those cylinders. They could stick out over the end, with that gunpowder stuff in them and the detonator in the tips where the taps are.
ROSE	Then if we ran the boat against the side of a ship, they'd -- well, they'd go off, just like a torpedo. in a return to her Wouldn't they?
ALLNUT	That might work. Them cylinders'd do right enough. I could let the gas out of 'em and fill 'em up with the gelignite. I could fix up a detonator all right. Revolver cartridge'd do. Why, sure, we could cut 'oles in the bows of the launch, and 'ave the cylinders stickin' out through them, so's to get the explosion near the water. Might turn the trick. But what would 'appen to us? It would blow this ole launch and us and everything all to Kingdom come.
ROSE	I wasn't thinking that we should be in the launch. Couldn't we get everything ready and have a -- what do you call it -- a good head of steam up and point the launch toward the ship and then dive off before it hit? Wouldn't that do?
ALLNUT	Might work, Miss. But what are we talkin' about, anyway. There ain't nothin' to torpedo. 'Cause The African Queen's the only boat on the river.
ROSE	Oh, yes there is.
ALLNUT	Is what?
ROSE	Something to torpedo.
ALLNUT	An' what's that, Miss?
ROSE	The Louisa.
ALLNUT	silent stare of mock amazement. Then, Don't talk silly, Miss. You can't do that. Honest you can't. I told you before we can't get down the river.
ROSE	Spengler did.
ALLNUT	In a canoe, Miss!
ROSE	If a German did it, we can, too.
ALLNUT	Not in no launch. We wouldn't 'ave a prayer.
ROSE	How do you know? You've never tried.
ALLNUT	Never tried shootin' myself through the 'ead, neither. Trouble with you is, you just don't know nothin' about boats, or water.
ROSE	In other words, you are refusing to help your country in her hour of need, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	I didn't say that.
ROSE	Well then --!
ALLNUT	'Ave it your own way, Miss -- only don't blame me, that's all.
ROSE	Very well, let's get started.
ALLNUT	What! Now, Miss?
ROSE	Yes, now. Come along.
ALLNUT	There isn't two hours of daylight left, Miss.
ROSE	We can go a long way in two hours.
ALLNUT	A lot o' the time I'm going to 'ave more than enough to do, keepin' the ole engine goin.' So you might as well start learnin' to steer right now.
ALLNUT	She ain't no one-man boat, the Queen. Not in the shape she's in.
ALLNUT	Know port from starboard, Miss?
ROSE	I've heard of them.
ALLNUT	Well, that's port -- -- an' that's starboard.
ROSE	Isn't that a bit -- well, silly? Why not just say left and right?
ALLNUT	Well, spose yer facin' the other way in the boat an' I say "to the left." You might think I meant to your left, see, an' move to starboard. It's the boat ya gotta think of, see? So port's always that side -- -- an' starboard, that -- an' forrard's always up there an' aft is where we are right now -- no matter what way we're turned around or the boat is headed.
ROSE	Why yes, I see. It's really quite -- sensible, isn't it?
ALLNUT	Uh huh. Okay. Now go easy, Miss -- light on the tiller. Now steer her just a little to starboard.
ALLNUT	Okay, Miss, just straighten her out again. Now looky here. Here's yer tiller. Here's yer rudder. They're joined. Tiller sets the rudder, rudder steers the boat.
ROSE	Oh, I see!
ALLNUT	Tiller, Miss!
ROSE	Sorry.
ALLNUT	'S all right, just don't never do that, 's all.
ROSE	Why, the water -- well -- pushes against the rudder, where it turns, and -- sort of drags the boat that way. Turns it.
ALLNUT	You're catchin' on fine, Miss.
ALLNUT	Now a little to starboard, Miss. Easy now. Fine. Now a little to port.
ROSE	Is that all there is to it?
ALLNUT	Well, ya gotta know how to read the river.
ROSE	Read?
ALLNUT	Ya gotta know the water an' what's under it, that ya gotta steer clear of.
ROSE	Steer clear of. Why, that's where that expression comes from.
ALLNUT	Uh huh. Mostly ya can tell it by the surface o' the water. Now ya see that long thing out there like a "V" kinda?
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	That always means a snag. Limb stickin' up from a dead tree; likes o' that.
ALLNUT	Stay off them "Vs," they're murder.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Now all that little choppin', them's shallas, Miss.
ROSE	What's that queer flat place, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	That's a rock. An' it ain't only a few inches under water. The Queen's got a shalla draft, an' that's where we're lucky. 'Cause anythin' ya can't read on the surface, we're safe to go right over it.
ALLNUT	Only thing to worry us is much of a breeze. I reckon you know why.
ROSE	It makes us -- it -- pushes the boat around?
ALLNUT	Naw. It chops the water so --
ALLNUT	Chops it up so bad ya can't see no signs to warn ya.
ROSE	Oh. Of course.
ROSE	What was the matter, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	Feed pump choked. An' one o' my boys dropped sumpin in the safety valve; can't count on it, ya gotta hit it.
ROSE	What happens when the feed pump chokes?
ALLNUT	Whole boiler can blow up. Specially the shape she's in. This water's awful muddy. Rots the tubes, plugs 'em up with scale. 'Sides that, the pressure gauge is kinda on the blink. Can't count on it fer sure, but ya can't forget it, neither. Bring 'er higher'n fifteen pound, the whole engine starts fallin' apart. An' much less'n that, she quits. Oh, come to think of it. Know why I got to keep the engine goin'?
ROSE	Why, so we can go, of course.
ALLNUT	That ain't wot I mean.
ALLNUT	'Cause if the engine dies ya ain't got enough --
ROSE	Oh. The water doesn't push against the rudder hard enough to --
ALLNUT	That's right. No steerage-way. An' in bad water that's life or death.
ALLNUT	If you steer wrong we're goners; if I let the engine die, we're goners, too.
ALLNUT	Oh, she's fulla tricks, this ole engine. Even the fuelin'. Ya gotta fuel 'er light an' steady, keep the pressure right. An' that ain't so easy as it sounds, Miss. 'Cause wood makes an awful lotta ash an' chokes yer draft. Ya gotta plan it all very careful. Empty the ash pan, ya gotta figure 'ow it'll change yer draft. Ya got 'alf a dozen different kinds o' wood an' every one burns different. Got to figure on wot the heat o' the sun does to the boiler, different times o' day. An' that safety valve. An' the water pipes keep springin' leaks, an' the water gauge just works when she's a mind to. You got to know 'ow she's feelin', Miss -- keep a step ahead of 'er. Right now she's got 'er best foot forrard 'cause there's a stranger aboard. But don't be took in, Miss. Wait till you see 'er in a mean streak.
ALLNUT	It's 'ot work, ain't it, Miss? I could do with a drink.
ALLNUT	'Ave one, Miss?
ROSE	What is it?
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Gin, Miss. And there's only river water to drink it with.
ROSE	No!
ALLNUT	Somethin' the matter, Miss?
ROSE	No.
ALLNUT	Now, Miss, 'ow 'bout some tea?
ROSE	Ohhh! Yes!
ALLNUT	'Course it tastes a bit rusty, but you can't 'ave everything. Sugar, Miss?
ROSE	'k you?
ALLNUT	don't mention it.
ROSE	more relaxed and female than at any It's simply delicious!
ALLNUT	Not 'alf bad, is it!
ROSE	If you please?
ALLNUT	Right. 'Ow long you been out 'ere, Miss?
ROSE	Almost ten years.
ALLNUT	You're from the midlands, ain't you?
ROSE	Manchester.
ALLNUT	Ever get 'omesick?
ROSE	Every day of my life.
ALLNUT	I'd give my eye teeth to be back on a Saturday night, rubbin' elbows like they say -- all the jostlin' an' the noise an' the music -- ain't nothin' can touch it for cheering a chap up.
ROSE	It's always Sunday afternoons I think of -- the peace and quiet.
ALLNUT	I don't remember very much about the Sundays. I was always sleeping it off.
ALLNUT	Didn't see no crocodiles in this arm, Miss, did you?
ROSE	Crocodiles? No.
ALLNUT	No shallas for 'em here. An' current's too fast. I could do with a bath, 'fore supper.
ROSE	I'd like one too.
ALLNUT	I'll go up in the bows an' hang onto the anchor chain. You just stay back 'ere an' do what you like to, Miss. Then, if we don't look, it won't matter.
ROSE	Very well.
ALLNUT	Well...
ROSE	Very well, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Are you ready, Miss?
ROSE	Yes.
ALLNUT	You better sleep 'ere under the awnin', Miss, 'case it rains. 'Ere's a coupla rugs. There ain't no fleas in 'em.
ROSE	Where will you sleep?
ALLNUT	Forrard, Miss. I can fix up a sorta bed outa them cases.
ROSE	The -- explosives?
ALLNUT	Sure, Miss. Won't do 'em no 'arm.
ROSE	All right.
ALLNUT	Be sure you cover up good. Gets a bit chilly on the river, towards mornin'.
ROSE	All right.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	I'll turn out the light if you're ready, Miss.
ROSE	Quite ready.
ALLNUT	'Night Miss.
ROSE	Good night, Mr. Allnutt.
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt!
ALLNUT	Sorry I woke you, Miss.
ROSE	What are you doing here?
ALLNUT	Blimey, Miss!
ROSE	Get out -- this instant!
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt.
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt!
ROSE	You may come in out of the rain, Mr. Allnutt!
ALLNUT	Thanks, Miss.
ROSE	Certainly, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Miss...
ROSE	Yes, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	Sorry I give you such a turn.
ROSE	That's quite all right, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Thanks, Miss. Night.
ROSE	Goodnight, Mr. Allnutt.
ROSE	What a frightfully strong smell, isn't it! I suppose it's bound to be at its worst in the middle of the day.
ALLNUT	What smell?
ROSE	The river. I never realized before how very strongly it smells.
ALLNUT	Hmm. So it does, now I notice it. Guess I'm on the water so much, I forget all about it.
ROSE	It's like marigolds. Stale ones.
ALLNUT	Don't guess I ever smelt no marigolds.
ROSE	Well, they smell just like this.
ALLNUT	Do, huh? Not a very good smell for a flower.
ROSE	They're very pretty, though. Marigolds.
ALLNUT	Are, eh?
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Yes?
ROSE	What is that roaring sound?
ALLNUT	Oh, that? Rapids, Miss.
ROSE	Really? So soon?
ALLNUT	Just around the bend. Kind of dangerous. P'raps I better take over, Miss.
ROSE	You be ready to -- but I'd like to try it.
ALLNUT	Well -- maybe that's a good idear at that, Miss. Learn by doin', like they say.
ALLNUT	Well, Miss, had enough?
ROSE	Enough? Of what, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	White water. Rapids. Now ya got a taste of it, how d'ya like it? Huh?
ROSE	Very much indeed. I'd never dreamed that any -- any mere -- er -- physical experience could be so -- so stimulating.
ROSE	So -- exhilarating.
ROSE	I notice that near rocks, the water seems to push away from the rock. One must take that into account in steering, mustn't one?
ROSE	You know, I've only known such -- excitement a few times before.
ROSE	A few times, in my dear Brother's sermons, when the Spirit was really upon him.
ROSE	Tell me, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	Yes?
ROSE	I steered rather well for a beginner, didn't I?
ALLNUT	Not so bad, Miss, considerin'. But that wasn't such bad water -- nothin' compared to what's farther on.
ROSE	I can hardly wait! Now that I've had a taste of it I don't wonder you love boating!
ROSE	Is something the matter, Mr. Allnutt?
ROSE	Tell me.
ALLNUT	Nothin'.
ALLNUT	Nothin' you'd understand.
ROSE	I want to understand. I just can't imagine what's the matter. It's been such a pleasant day. What is it, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	All this fool talk about The Louisa. Goin' down the river...
ROSE	What do you mean?
ALLNUT	I mean we ain't goin' to do nothin' of the sort.
ROSE	Why, of course we're going! What an absurd idea!
ALLNUT	What an absurd idea! What an absurd idea! Lady, I may be a born fool, but you got ten absurd idears to my one, an' don't you forget it! Huh!
ROSE	Why don't you want to go, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	What do I want to blow up sumpin' for? You tell me. Yeah. You tell me. That's all!
ROSE	Why don't you want to go?
ALLNUT	Already come further'n I ever meant to. Don't hardly even know the river, this far down. Only come this far 'cause there you was all by your lonesome, lost your brother and all -- wot you get for feelin' sorry for people.
ROSE	Why, Mr. Allnutt?
ALLNUT	This river. That's why. An' Shona.
ROSE	Shona!
ALLNUT	Shona! If there's any place along the whole river the Germans'll keep a lookout, it'll be Shona. 'Cause that's where the old road ferries over from the South.
ROSE	But they can't do anything to us!
ALLNUT	Oh, they can't, eh? They got rifles, maybe machine guns, maybe even cannons, an' just one bullet in that blastin' gelatine an', Miss, what's left of us would be in bits and pieces.
ROSE	Then we'll go by at night.
ALLNUT	Oh no, we won't!
ROSE	Now why not?
ALLNUT	'Cause the rapids start just a little ways below Shona, an' they ain't nobody in his right mind 'ud tackle 'em even in daylight, let alone at night.
ROSE	Then we'll go in daylight. We'll go on the far side of the river from Shona, just as fast as ever we can.
ALLNUT	-- Say, who do you think you are, all this we'll do this an' we'll do that? 'Oose boat is this, any'ow? 'Oo asked you aboard? Huh? Huh? You crazy, psalm-singin', skinny old maid.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Gimmy regards ter Leicester Square Sweet Piccadilly an' Myefair, Remember me to the folks darn there They'll under-sta-and.
ALLNUT	Oh... Oh...!
ALLNUT	Oh...!
ALLNUT	Miss.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Miss?
ALLNUT	Have pity, Miss! Miss? Oh, Miss, you don't know what you're doin'... I'll perish without a hair o' the dog.
ALLNUT	Ain't your property, Miss.
ALLNUT	Oh...!
ALLNUT	Ow... cut myself.
ALLNUT	Huh!
ALLNUT	Well, Miss, 'ere we are, everything ship-shape, like they say.
ALLNUT	Great thing to 'ave a lyedy aboard, with clean 'abits. Sets me a good example. A man alone, 'e gets to livin' like a bloomin' 'og. Then, too, with me, it's always -- put things orf. Never do todye wot ya can put orf till tomorrer. But you: business afore pleasure, every time. Do yer pers'nal laundry, make yerself spic an' span, get all the mendin' out o' the way, an' then, an' hone-ly then, set down to a nice quiet hour with the Good-Book. I tell you, it's a model for me, like. An inspiration. I ain't got that ole engine so clean in years; inside an' out, Miss. Just look at 'er, Miss! She practically sparkles. Myself, too. Guess you ain't never 'ad a look at me without whiskers an' all cleaned up, 'ave you, Miss? Freshens you up, too; if I only 'ad clean clothes, like you. Now you: why you could be at 'igh tea. 'Ow 'bout some tea, Miss, come to think of it? Don't you stir; I'll get it ready.
ALLNUT	'Ow's the book, Miss? Not that I ain't read it, some -- that is to say, me ole lyedy read me stories out of it. 'Ow 'bout readin' it out loud, eh, Miss? I'd like to 'ave a little spiritual comfort m'self. An' you call yerself a Christian! You 'ear me, Miss. Don't yer? Don't yer? HUH??
ALLNUT	Heyy!!
ALLNUT	Feller takes a drop too much once in a while. T's only yoomin nyture.
ROSE	Nature, Mr. Allnutt, is what we are put into this world to rise above.
ALLNUT	Miss, I'm sorry. I 'pologize. There. What more can a man do than say he's sorry. Eh? You done paid me back, Miss. Didn't even leave me a drop. Come on, Miss. 'Ave a 'eart, can't ya? Fair's fair. Miss, I don't care wot ya say, long 's you say somepin. I'll be honest with ya, Miss: I just can't stand no more of it. I ain't used to it, that's all.
ROSE	So you think it was your nasty drunkenness I mind.
ALLNUT	Well -- wot else?
ROSE	You lied to me.
ALLNUT	Lied? Oh no, Miss. Lyin's one thing I don't never do. Not unless there's no way out.
ROSE	You promised we'd go down the river.
ALLNUT	Why, Miss! Is that wot it's all about?
ROSE	Of course.
ALLNUT	Now for the last time, Miss. Just try and listen, won't you? Try to understand. It's sure death a dozen times over down this river. I 'ate to disappoint you, Miss. But don't blyme me. Blyme the river.
ROSE	You promised.
ALLNUT	Well, I'm takin' my promise back!
ALLNUT	G'mornin', Miss.
ALLNUT	All right, Miss. You win.
ALLNUT	Down the river we go.
ROSE	Have some breakfast, Mr. Allnutt.
ROSE	Or, no. Get up steam. Breakfast can wait.
ROSE	Which bank is Shona on?
ALLNUT	'Ow's that?
ROSE	Which bank is Shona on?
ALLNUT	Left. On a hill.
ROSE	Good. The sun will be in their eyes.
ALLNUT	Huh?
ROSE	The sun. Will be in their eyes.
ROSE	Don't worry, Mr. Allnutt.
ALLNUT	If a bullet hits them boxes, there'll be no time to worry.
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt!
ALLNUT	Keep as low as ya can, Miss.
ALLNUT	Just turn 'er loose, Miss. Let 'er drift.
ALLNUT	Let 'er drift! All we can do!
ALLNUT	'Cross our bows, I reckon. Didn't 'it us any'ow.
1ST OFFICER	But why didn't they put in?
2ND OFFICER	Probably they're making for the lower landing.
1ST OFFICER	Fire twice more across their bows.
2ND OFFICER	She is adrift.
1ST OFFICER	Fire.
1ST OFFICER	Again.
1ST OFFICER	She's not turning.
2ND OFFICER	She can't. She is adrift.
1ST OFFICER	Order your men to fire.
CORPORAL	Fire!
CORPORAL	Fire!
ALLNUT	They got us!
ROSE	Finished?
ALLNUT	Yes -- if we can get up steam in time, an' the boiler'll stand that much cold water, an' the mend holds.
ALLNUT	mute during the If only we don't drift into the back eddy.
1ST OFFICER	Give it to me.
1ST OFFICER	Fire at random.
CORPORAL	Everybody shoot.
ALLNUT	Man the tiller now -- we'll try.
ALLNUT	Our Father Who art in Heaven...
ALLNUT	Need fuel! We got to get fuel!
ROSE	Stop the engine!
ALLNUT	Whew!!!
ROSE	How lovely!
ROSE	Lovely, isn't it.
ALLNUT	It is at that. We sure pulled it off, didn't we, Miss? Sucked the Germans in proper. They were so surprised to see the ole African Queen -- they didn't think of shootin' at us till we were almost past. They didn't believe anybody'd try to get down these gorges. Didn't believe nobody could. Well, we showed 'em, didn't we? Not that I'd like to do it every day of the week. We took on enough water to sink anything else that floats. He reaches for the pump and goes to work.
ROSE	Here -- let me do that.
ALLNUT	Oh, no, Miss.
ROSE	Please let me.
ALLNUT	All right -- but don't wear yourself out... I'll pick up some wood.
ROSE	I hardly know what happened after Shona. Everything's a jumble. I have no idea how far we've come or whether it's morning or afternoon or --
ALLNUT	I guess you were too busy, Miss, to pay attention to anything but what you were doing.
ROSE	Did I -- do all right?
ALLNUT	Better'n all right, Miss...
ALLNUT	Picked up a thorn on the bank, I guess. Went right through the rubber sole.
ROSE	Let me.
ROSE	No, there's nothing there now.
ALLNUT	Thank you, Miss.
ALLNUT	It is pretty at that.
ALLNUT	It reminds me -- that waterfall does -- of --
ROSE	Mr. Allnutt. I mean -- dear.
ALLNUT	Well now -- blimey! This is more like it.
ROSE	Two spoonfuls of sugar is right, isn't it?
ALLNUT	Fancy your building the fire and all -- while I slept.
ROSE	Dear -- there's something I simply must know.
ALLNUT	What's that?
ROSE	What's your first name?
ALLNUT	Charlie.
ROSE	Charlie... Charlie... Charlie...
ALLNUT	Give us another kiss.
ROSE	Charlie! Charlie dear...
ROSE	This must be one of the loveliest places in all Africa.
ALLNUT	I've been around a bit and I must say I never seen no place to compare with it in the whole world. Kinda hate to leave it. Not that I ain't all for goin' on, Y'unnerstand. Do you spose that last big cataract coulda been Ulanga Falls? As I remember the map, it was just a little way down from Shona. And if it was Ulanga, there ain't no more big cataracts between us an' the lake.
ROSE	How much farther is the lake, Charlie?
ALLNUT	Oh -- 'bout two 'undred miles.
ROSE	Well, I suppose it's time we were on our way.
ALLNUT	Give us another kiss, old girl.
ROSE	Stop, Charlie -- stop it!
ALLNUT	Rosie, listen... You 'ear wot I 'ear?
ALLNUT	I guess that wasn't Ulanga Falls, after all.
ROSE	I guess not.
ROSE	Goodbye, Charlie.
ROSE	Keep her going, Charlie!
ROSE	Charlie!
ALLNUT	We nearly done it that time, didn't we, Rosie.
ROSE	I wonder how much we've lost.
ALLNUT	Let's get this water out and see.
ALLNUT	It's better than we coulda hoped for. We 'aven't lost nothin', far as I can see. 'Aven't damaged 'er skin worth mentionin'. I shoulda thought there'd been an 'ole in 'er somewheres, after wot she's been through.
ROSE	What was all that clattering just before we stopped?
ALLNUT	We still got to find that out, old girl.
ROSE	How are we going to do that, dear?
ALLNUT	I'll 'ave to go underneath and 'ave a look.
ALLNUT	There ain't no other way. You stay 'andy with that rope -- case there's a fancy current down at the bottom... 'Ere goes!
ROSE	Could you see anything, dear?
ALLNUT	Yes.
ALLNUT	Shaft's bent to blazes like a corkscrew, and there's a blade gone off the prop.
ROSE	We'll have to mend it, then.
ALLNUT	Mend it! Not likely.
ROSE	Why is that, dear? What shall we have to do before we go on?
ALLNUT	I'll tell ya. I'll tell ya what we could do if we was sittin' in the landin' slip at Limbasi. We could pull this old tub out an' take the shaft down an' 'aul it over to the workshop where they'd forge it straight again. An' then we could write to the makers and get a new prop. They might 'ave one in stock 'cause this boat ain't over thirty years old. An' while we was waitin' we might clean 'er bottom an' paint 'er. Then we could put in the shaft an' the new prop an' launch 'er an' go on as if nothin' 'ad 'appened. -- But this ain't Limbasi, an' so we can't.
ROSE	Can't you get the shaft out without pulling the boat on shore?
ALLNUT	I dunno. I might. Means workin' underwater. Could do it perhaps.
ROSE	Well, if you were able to get the shaft up on shore, could you straighten it?
ALLNUT	Ain't got no hearth. Ain't got no anvil. Ain't got no coal. Ain't got nothin'. An' furthermore, I ain't no blacksmith.
ROSE	I saw a Masai native working once. Using charcoal... on a big hollow stone. He had a boy to fan the charcoal.
ALLNUT	Yes, I've seen that, too! But I'd use a bellows, myself -- make them easy enough.
ROSE	Well, if you think that would be better.
ALLNUT	There's 'eaps an' 'eaps of driftwood up on the bank.
ROSE	Why don't you try it?
ALLNUT	No. It ain't no use, Rosie, old girl. I was forgettin' that prop. There's a blade gone.
ROSE	Can't we go on the blades that are left?
ALLNUT	There's a torque. Prop wouldn't be balanced. Wouldn't take five minutes for the shaft to be like a corkscrew again.
ROSE	We'll have to make another blade. There's lots of iron and stuff you could use.
ALLNUT	And tie it on, I suppose.
ROSE	Yes, if you think that will do. But wouldn't it be better to -- weld it? That's the right word, isn't it? Weld it on?
ALLNUT	You're a one, Rosie. Really you are.
ROSE	Isn't weld the right word, dear? You know what I mean even if it isn't, don't you?
ALLNUT	Oh, it's the right word, all right.
ALLNUT	Swallered about half the river that time.
ROSE	You were down there an awfully long time. I got scared.
ALLNUT	Shaft is ready to come out now. It'll be too heavy for me to swim up with. I'll 'ave to walk with it in to shore... Well, 'ere goes -- for the last time, I 'ope.
ROSE	Charlie.
ALLNUT	Huh?
ROSE	Let me help you.
ALLNUT	'Ow do you mean?
ALLNUT	Wot d'you think you're goin' to do?
ROSE	Go down with you.
ALLNUT	An' get drownded? You don't know wot it's like, Rosie. Them currents is just fierce. Wot'll you be thinkin' of next! Well, 'ere goes.
ALLNUT	If my old dad 'ad put me to blacksmithin' when I was a kid, I don't think I should never 'ave come to Africa. I might've -- into his eyes; he is thinking about Charing Cross on a Saturday -- But then I shouldn't never 'ave met you, Rosie old girl. I wouldn't trade you for all the fried fish shops in the world.
ROSE	Oh, Charlie!
ALLNUT	Well, I guess it's just about as good as I can get it -- And it didn't take so long a time, neither.
ROSE	Only a week.
ALLNUT	The blade's a different proposition. I'll 'ave to make it.
ALLNUT	It turns right enough. But that don't prove nothin' much. Will it stand up under a full head of steam, that's the question. We'll get our answer out there -- and Lord 'elp us if it ain't the right one.
ROSE	Let's find out right now.
ALLNUT	Why not?
ALLNUT	Goodbye, darling.
ROSE	Goodbye, darling.
ALLNUT	Well, we done it, old girl. We got down the rapids all right. I didn't think it could be done. If it 'adn't been for you, sweetheart, we shouldn't be 'ere now. Don't you feel proud of yourself, dear?
ROSE	No, of course not. Look at the way you made the engine go. Look how you mended the propeller. It wasn't me at all. I don't think there's another man alive who could have done it.
ALLNUT	I don't think anyone's likely to try.
ALLNUT	Looks like this old river got tired of all that runnin' an' jumpin' she did an' decided to lay down an' rest for a while... 'Ow about our doin' the same, Rosie -- seein' as 'ow the sun's goin' down.
ALLNUT	It must be right 'bout 'ere the river changes her nyme from Ulanga to Bora. Not that it matters. Nobody lives between 'ere and the lake. Unless you call monkeys people.
ROSE	How much farther do you think it is to the lake?
ALLNUT	Oh -- not so many miles, but --
ROSE	But what, Charlie?
ALLNUT	I got a feelin' that before long we'll wish we was shootin' the rapids again... Ow!... Ow!
ROSE	Oh!
ALLNUT	This is awful!
ROSE	I'm going in! I'm going to get under the water!
ALLNUT	Yes! That's it!
ALLNUT	No!
ROSE	But I'm being eaten alive!
ALLNUT	Look.
ALLNUT	What'd you say 'bout bein' eaten alive?
ROSE	Get me out of here, Charlie! I'm going mad!
ALLNUT	Ain't no steam. Can't start engine.
ROSE	I can't stand it, Charlie!
ALLNUT	'Ere! Lay down! Get under the canvas there! I'll get us out into the channel.
ALLNUT	Right, Rosie. We got away from 'em. You can come out.
ROSE	I'm ashamed, Charlie, acting like that -- but I couldn't help it. I was going mad.
ALLNUT	Me, too.
ROSE	You're so bitten!
ALLNUT	The bites themselves ain't so bad; it's 'avin' them all round you. I've 'eard of them sendin' buffaloes an' native cattle stark starin' mad -- an' they run an' run till they fall dead.
ROSE	What are we going to do, Charlie?
ALLNUT	Now you're asking!
ROSE	Will they be like that wherever we tie up?
ALLNUT	Can't say.
ROSE	We can't just drift all night.
ALLNUT	If the river keeps straight an' deep an' slow, there ain't nothin' much can 'urt us -- I know! I'll let the anchor out a ways. She'll stop us before trouble gets too near.
ALLNUT	What a time, Rosie -- what a time! We'll never lack for stories to tell our grandchildren -- if we live to 'ave any.
ALLNUT	Look -- maybe that's a channel. No.
ROSE	What about there? That looks like a way through.
ALLNUT	Could be. I dunno. Once we get in, an' these 'ere reeds close up be'ind our stern -- we'd never get back, you know, Rosie.
ROSE	We can't stay going round and round out here.
ALLNUT	If anything goes wrong a few 'undred feet in there, we're 'eld in a trap, you know -- till we starve or go orf our 'eads. I dunno! All right. Put 'er over.
ALLNUT	It's the propeller, I think. It won't work in this mud.
ALLNUT	Where's the boat-'ook?
ALLNUT	Maybe we can pull 'er along.
ROSE	Here! Wait a minute!
ALLNUT	Come on -- again!
ALLNUT	We've come along under steam, and we paddled an' pushed 'an' pulled the ole boat along with the 'ook. Wot we ain't done yet is get out an' carry 'er. I spose that'll come next.
ROSE	Hard to breathe! -- the air is so wet and heavy.
ALLNUT	Can't 'ardly tell water from land -- or for that matter, day from night.
ROSE	The whole thing is like a fever dream, isn't it?
ALLNUT	All the channels we've lost -- an' the twistin' we've done -- we may come back out where we started -- if we come out at all.
ROSE	We've always followed the current, dear -- what little there is.
ALLNUT	That don't mean nothin' -- with this river. This river's crazy. Crazy as I am!
ROSE	Charlie. We must try to keep hold of ourselves.
ALLNUT	Sorry, old girl.
ALLNUT	Best thing to put the roses back in our cheeks is to get out o' these reeds.
ALLNUT	What I said a while back about 'avin' to carry the boat was meant for a joke -- but as it turns out, I wasn't jokin'.
ALLNUT	What's the matter?
ALLNUT	Augh, the little beggars -- Pull 'em off me, Rosie -- no, the heads stay -- poison yer blood.
ROSE	Salt!
ALLNUT	Anythin' I hate in this world it's leeches -- filthy devils.
ALLNUT	Back! 'Old 'er back --
ROSE	Mud?
ALLNUT	Yes.
ALLNUT	Let's try an' get 'er over it, then. Give 'er all you got, Rosie.
ALLNUT	Good girl -- we're still makin' 'eadway -- All you got now --
ROSE	There, there, dear. There, there. There, dear.
ALLNUT	Fine specimen of a man I am, ain't I!
ROSE	You're the bravest man that ever lived.
ROSE	Lie down, dear. Rest. Both of us.
ROSE	You just overdo, that's all. You must take care of yourself! You're not one bit well.
ALLNUT	Well! We're both of us half dead.
ROSE	Besides, it's high time we had our supper. It'll be dark before long.
ALLNUT	You 'ave some. I ain't up to it yet.
ROSE	Or a nice steaming cup of tea.
ALLNUT	You fix yourself some.
ROSE	Not just yet, thank you. Come now. Lie-down.
ROSE	There now. All comfy?
ALLNUT	You rest, too.
ROSE	Indeed I will. That's all we need, a good long rest, and we'll be on our way in a jiffy. You'll see.
ALLNUT	Sure.
ROSE	Try to sleep, dear.
ALLNUT	Sure. You too.
ROSE	Of course.
ALLNUT	Rosie.
ROSE	Yes, Charlie.
ALLNUT	You want to know the truth, don't you?
ROSE	I know it.
ROSE	We're finished.
ALLNUT	That's right.
ROSE	Even if we had all our strength we'd never be able to get her off this mud.
ALLNUT	Not a chance in this world.
ROSE	So useless!
ALLNUT	They don't come no better'n you.
ALLNUT	Rose. Rosie.
ALLNUT	Darling. Dear.
ALLNUT	Look at us, Rosie! My God just look! We're movin', dear! We're movin'!
ROSE	We did our best, dear.
ALLNUT	No, look, Rosie, just look at us! We're movin', don't you see? Movin', that's what!
ALLNUT	Easy, Rosie dear! You just rest, old girl. Easy now.
ROSE	It -- really is?
ALLNUT	Come on -- sit down, old girl. Yer tremblin' like a leaf.
ALLNUT	There, there, Rosie. There, old girl. We're all right now, dear. There, there.
ROSE	It's like Heaven.
ROSE	God let us live.
ALLNUT	Musta been 'Im, all right -- 'tweren't nothin' in our power.
ROSE	It wasn't for our sakes, either.
ALLNUT	'Ow you mean, Rosie?
ROSE	He brought us here to do His work.
ALLNUT	Rosie, this lake's an 'undred miles long; forty wide, at the biggest. It might be days afore she comes our way.
ROSE	Then start the fire. We'll go find her.
ALLNUT	No, Rosie, we won't 'ave to go out of our way. She'll come to us.
ROSE	Come to us?
ALLNUT	Patrolin' the lake. She's bound to come by, don't you never worry. An' when she does, we want to be well 'id.
ROSE	Hmmm. Perhaps you're right.
ALLNUT	Sure I am. So let's just cruise about a bit till we find a good 'idin' place, an' then we'll lay in wait fer 'er. Right?
ROSE	Right.
ALLNUT	Let's -- see. We might, uh --
His eyes sharpen into great intentness on something very	
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	That's The Louisa.
ALLNUT	Yes, that's The Louisa all right.
ROSE	Which way are they going?
ALLNUT	They're comin' this way.
ROSE	They mustn't see us here. Can we get far enough among the reeds for them not to see us?
ALLNUT	Got to work fast.
ROSE	We'll have to cut some down. How deep is the mud?
ROSE	There's still a bit of her sticking out.
ROSE	She's coming right toward us, Charlie!
ROSE	They're going a different way now.
ALLNUT	I thought they'd seen us.
ALLNUT	They're makin' for them islands to anchor for the night. They'll go on in the mornin'. But don't you worry. They'll come 'ere again. You just see if they don't. You know 'ow Germans are; they lays down systems an' they sticks to 'em. Mondays they're at one place. Tuesdays somewheres else. Wednesdays p'raps they're 'ere. Same ole round, week after week. You know.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Look! Wot did I tell ya! She's droppin' 'er anchor.
ROSE	How long will it take to get the torpedoes ready?
ALLNUT	I can get the stuff into the tubes in no time, as you might say. Don't know 'bout the detonators. Gotta make them up, you see -- devise something. Then we got to cut 'oles in the bows. Might 'ave it all done in three days. Depends on them detonators.
ALLNUT	Rosie, old girl -- Rosie --
ROSE	Yes, dear.
ALLNUT	I know wot you're thinkin' 'bout doin'. You're thinkin' 'bout takin' The African Queen out at night next time The Louisa comes 'ere, ain't you, old girl? We ought to manage it.
ALLNUTT'S VOICE	Ought to work all right.
ALLNUT	Can't put them into the cylinders yet. They're a bit tricky. We can put 'em in when we're all ready to start.
ROSE	It will be dark then, of course. Will you be able to do it in the dark?
ALLNUT	Case of have to... Better get the cylinders into place now.
ALLNUT	Well, old girl -- I done it all now. Everything. We're all ready.
ALLNUT	You know I been thinkin'. There ain't no need for us both to -- to do it. Now I've 'ad time to study it, I can plainly see it's a one-man job.
ROSE	You couldn't be more right, Charlie dear.
ALLNUT	Glad you agree, Rosie. When the time comes I'll put you ashore on the south side of the lake and you wait for me while I attend to The Louisa...
ROSE	Certainly not! You're the one to be put ashore.
ALLNUT	Me...?
ROSE	Of course, you. This whole thing was my idea, wasn't it?... I'm the logical one to carry it out.
ALLNUT	Why, Rose! I'm surprised! You're a very sensible woman as a rule. Now we won't 'ave no more talk along those lines.
ROSE	I can manage this launch every bit as well as you, Charlie Allnutt, and you know it!
ALLNUT	Rosie, you're cracked!
ROSE	Didn't I steer going down the rapids?
ALLNUT	Oh, you steered well enough. But you don't know nothin' about the engine. Spose she broke down on you out there in the middle of the lake? Where would you be? But me, I'd leave the tiller and go and do a thing or two to the engine -- you know, spit on 'er or kick 'er in the belly -- an' she'd go right to work again. She knows 'oo 'er boss is, you bet, that ole engine does.
ROSE	All right, Charlie. I guess you have to be there.
ALLNUT	Well, now, that's more like it. I'll dive off a second or two before the crash and swim over to where you'll be waitin' on the north shore.
ROSE	Charlie...
ALLNUT	Yes.
ROSE	No need of our pretending.
ALLNUT	I don't know wot you're talkin' about.
ROSE	Oh, yes you do. There's got to be a hand on that tiller right up to the last.
ROSE	Don't you understand, dear? I wouldn't care about going on to Nairobi -- without you.
ROSE	We'll do it together. It will be you at the engine and me at the tiller, as it has been from the start.
ALLNUT	Right.
ROSE	When you come to think of it, we're a very lucky couple, really.
ALLNUT	Aren't we just.
ROSE	Charlie.
ALLNUT	Yes, dear.
ROSE	Let's make The African Queen as clean as we can. Let's scrub her decks and polish her brass.
ALLNUT	I've got a can o' paint for 'er mast. She ought to look 'er best. 'Er very best. Representin' as she does the Royal Navy.
ALLNUT	I wish I 'ad somethin' clean to put on. It don't seem right for the ship's captain to be without pants.
ROSE	Charlie...
ALLNUT	Yes, dear.
ROSE	I have a pair you can wear.
ALLNUT	You mean a pair o' yours?
ROSE	What's the difference?
ALLNUT	Well, you're the one'll have to look at me.
ROSE	Here. Put this on, too.
ALLNUT	Ain't that goin' a bit too far?
ROSE	Don't be silly!
ALLNUT	Blowing up a bit. We better get started. All right?
ROSE	All right.
ROSE	Is something the matter, dear?
ALLNUT	'Er bows are ridin' awful low for this kind o' water. Them 'eavy cylinders are what's doin' it.
ALLNUT	Got to get 'er nose way up 'igh or we'll be in trouble.
ROSE	We've been through worse.
ALLNUT	Rivers is one thing -- open water another. She ain't built for it. Not when it's rough.
ALLNUT	Rosie.
ROSE	Yes, Charlie.
ALLNUT	This 'ere storm is messing things up a bit. 'Er bows 'ave got to ride 'igh or we'll be swamped before we get 'alf way to The Louisa. On the other 'and, they've got to be low when we 'it 'er, so' the explosion will be down at 'er waterline.
ROSE	Can anything be done?
ALLNUT	Just before we 'it, I'll bring the ballast back forrard.
ROSE	Goodbye, darling.
ALLNUT	Goodbye, sweetheart darling...
ALLNUT	Blimey!
1ST OFFICER	What is your nationality?
1ST OFFICER	French?... Belgian?... English?
ALLNUT	English.
1ST OFFICER	Your name?
ALLNUT	Charles Allnutt.
1ST OFFICER	What were you doing on the island?
ALLNUT	All right. 'Ang me. 'Oo cares?
1ST OFFICER	What were you doing on the island?
ALLNUT	Nothing.
1ST OFFICER	How did you get there?
ALLNUT	Swam.
1ST OFFICER	Do you know that you are in an area prohibited to all but members of the forces of His Imperial Majesty, Kaiser Wilhelm II?
ALLNUT	'Oo cares?
1ST OFFICER	What is your rank.
ALLNUT	'Ow's that?
1ST OFFICER	You are a soldier, are you not?
ALLNUT	Naaa!
1ST OFFICER	What are you then?
ALLNUT	I ain't nothin'.
1ST OFFICER	The prisoner is obviously here to spy on the movements of the Königin Luise.
2ND OFFICER	No proof of criminal intent --
CAPTAIN	What were you doing here, if you were not spying? The Court sentences you to death by hanging. Not from the yard arm, but when we reach port.
PETTY OFFICER	We are about to pick up another one. A woman.
CAPTAIN' VOICE	She looks like she's white.
CAPTAIN	Was there a woman with you?
ALLNUT	Rosie! Rosie!
ROSE	Charlie!
CAPTAIN	Who is that woman?
ALLNUT	I don't know.
CAPTAIN	But you just called her by name.
ALLNUT	I thought it was somebody else.
CAPTAIN	Maybe I'll change my mind and hang you from the yard arm after all.
ROSE	Charlie dear!
ALLNUT	'Ello, Rosie.
CAPTAIN	Aha! You do know her!
ALLNUT	I calls all the girls Rosie.
WHITE OFFICER	She had this with her.
CAPTAIN	Who are you?
ROSE	Miss Rose Sayer.
CAPTAIN	English?
ROSE	Of course.
CAPTAIN	What are you doing on the lake?
ALLNUT	I ain't told 'im nothin', Rosie.
1ST OFFICER	Silence!
CAPTAIN	Answer the question!
ROSE	We were boating.
CAPTAIN	Last night? In such weather?
ROSE	We were not responsible for the weather.
CAPTAIN	And why were you boating?
ROSE	That is our affair.
1ST OFFICER	As your fellow-prisoner has already learned, the penalty for not answering the court is death.
ROSE	You mean he --
ROSE	Charlie! Are they telling me...
CAPTAIN	Order!
ROSE	Stop that!
ROSE	Are they, Charlie? The truth?
CAPTAIN	Fraulein Sayer, you will come to order and answer the questions of this court.
ROSE	Ask your questions.
CAPTAIN	What were you doing on the lake?
ROSE	We came here to sink this ship, and --
ALLNUT	Rosie!
ROSE	-- and we would have, too, except for --
ALLNUT	Rosie!
ROSE	Let's at least have the fun of telling them about it, Charlie.
ALLNUT	Don't you believe her, yer Honor. She's touched with the fever.
ROSE	Oh stop it, Charlie, we've been through all this. I'm not going to outlive you and that's all there is to it.
CAPTAIN	Just how, Fraulein, did you propose to sink -- the Königin Luise?
ROSE	We were going to ram you.
CAPTAIN	With how large a vessel?
ROSE	With torpedoes.
CAPTAIN AND 1ST OFFICER	Torpedoes!
2ND OFFICER	Torpedoes?
CAPTAIN AND 1ST OFFICER	Torpedoes.
2ND OFFICER	Nein! believe Rose and
1ST OFFICER	I think it is safe to assume, Miss Sayer, that the British Admiralty did not entrust you and this -- gentleman -- with the torpedoes. Will you be so good as to tell us precisely where and how you acquired them?
ROSE	Acquired? Mr. Allnutt made them.
1ST OFFICER	How very interesting.
ROSE	I don't think you even believe me. Tell him how you did it, Charlie. the officers exchange glances which mean:
ALLNUT	Well -- wot I did was take the 'eads off two cylinders of oxygen an' fill 'em up with 'igh explosive -- 'bout two 'undred weight. That was easy enough -- it was the detonators took some hingenooity. Know wot I used? Cartridges, an' nails, in blocks o' soft wood. A pretty job. Then I mounted the cylinders so they stuck through the bows of The African Queen, near the water line, so when we rammed you --
CAPTAIN	Where is The African Queen?
ROSE	She sank in the storm.
CAPTAIN	How did you get onto the lake?
ROSE	We came down the Ulanga -- the Bora, you call it down here.
CAPTAIN	
1ST OFFICER	
2ND OFFICER	But that is impossible!
ROSE	Nevertheless!
CAPTAIN	Everybody knows the river is unnavigable.
ROSE	We came down it, though -- didn't we, Charlie? -- on The African Queen.
1ST OFFICER	The man first.
ROSE	Please -- hang us together.
CAPTAIN	Very well.
ALLNUT	Rosie, I ain't gonna say goodbye again. It's gettin' to be an old story.
ROSE	Darling!
ALLNUT	Wot 'appened?
ROSE	We did it, Charlie, we did it!
ALLNUT	But 'ow?
ALLNUT	Well I'll be... Are you all right, Rosie?
ROSE	Never better. And you, dear?
ALLNUT	Bit of all right.
ROSE	I'm all turned round, Charlie. Which way is the south shore?
ALLNUT	The one we're swimming towards, old girl.
