Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever con- ducted. Your daughters - they will be spectacular! Yes, and especially my little Ariel. Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . . [sotto] If only daughters: Ah, we are the daughters of Triton. Great father who loves us and named us well: Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana.

Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life? Wow, cool! But, err, what is it? I don't know. But I bet Scuttle will. What was that? Did you hear something? (Distracted by pipe.) Hmm, I wonder what this one is? Ariel . . Flounder, will you relax. Nothing is going to happen. (Laughing.) Flounder, you really are a guppy. I am not.
Scuttle!	(Looking through the telescope the wrong way, shouting.) Whoa! Scuttle - look what we found. Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy. What? What is it? It's a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies . . . to of hair that humans go nuts over! A dinglehopper! What about that one? (Holding pipe) Ah - this I haven't seen in years.

Maybe you could make a little planter Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. (Waves.) Anytime sweetie, anytime.

They think they know everything. You give Do you, er, think I - I was too hard on her? Definitely not. Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was You're absolutely right, Sebastian. Of course. Ariel needs constant supervision. Constant. Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble. All the time - And YOU are just the crab to do it. Ariel, are you okay? If only I could make him understand. I just don't see things the way he bad.
