	least your name isn't Michael Bolton.
	there's nothing wrong with that name.

	Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you

	a really good idea. (sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you
	tell you what I'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time.
	it? If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two at the same time?

	don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my
	payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll,
	you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points
	that the guy?
	
	Well, uh, I'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team. Uh,
	I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told

	I didn't feel like it.
	what is wrong with you?! First, you sit there while Dr. Swanson
	MACHINE) LISTEN, ASSHOLE. NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME. WE'RE
	now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job
	Peter? How come he didn't show up this weekend?
	I don't know.
	would really, really help us out.
	WHO'S THAT GUY?
	uh, any questions?
	I'm Peter.
	How can I help you?

	our specials are barbecued chicken - it's actually right over
	Look who's back! Table for three, to -
	was asking what you were doing for lunch. Would you like to have with me?
	are you serious? Yeah, I don't , I don't think I'm supposed to do
	I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go next door and get a
	when you say "next door", do you mean Chili's or Flingers?
	
	
SLYDELL	what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and
	that's right.
PORTER	then I gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the
	uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with
SLYDELL	physically take the specs from the customer?
	no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax.
SLYDELL	
PORTER	you must physically bring them to the software people.
	Yeah, I mean, sometimes.
SLYDELL	what would you say you do here?

SLYDELL	see. You're Michael...Bolton?

SLYDELL	GOD DAMN right he is.
PORTER	tell me. What's your favorite song of his?
	I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all.
SLYDELL	HA! I feel the exact same way, but it must be hard for you, I mean,
	you know, you can just call me Mike.
	
	
	wonder if they will let me wear this in here.
	think it would be ok. Would you like to sit down?
	(does so) Wow. This place is really nice.

	I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could

	I'll set the building on fire.
	
	
	the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here
	just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a
	Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on What were you doing?
	I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything
	I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know, supposed to be having your interview right now with the

	Bob. Bob.
PORTER	don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute?
SLYDELL	what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel
	
SLYDELL	
	I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side
PORTER	out?
	I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that
SLYDELL	Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a
	me tell you something about TPS reports...'
	thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't
PORTER	don't care? a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and
SLYDELL	beg your pardon?
	bosses.
SLYDELL	
	bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different
SLYDELL	with me for a minute.
	
SLYDELL	me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some
	don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice
SLYDELL	It's all on this side of the table, trust me.
	luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.
SLYDELL	
	Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -
	Would you come here for a moment, please?
	sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.
	need to talk about your flair.
	I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him

	it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare
	Ok, you want me to wear more?

	So, more then?
	we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare
	Yeah.
	Great. That's all I ask.
	
SLYDELL	So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom
	useless.
SLYDELL	
	good to me.
SLYDELL	a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.
	he?
	know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.
	
SLYDELL	can't find a record of him being a current employee here.
PORTER	looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed
	
	um, Milton has been let go.
SLYDELL	a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he
PORTER	always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is
SLYDELL	we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this
	uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with
PORTER	handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.
SLYDELL	
PORTER	that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really
SLYDELL	it is.
	I'm not sure about that now.
PORTER	right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you
	
	Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!
	Peter.
	Dom!
	Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have
	right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to
	I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.
	they called me at home.
	sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all
	
	Milton. What's going on?
	I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.
	you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.
	I did and they, and they said -
	we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.
	
	we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can
	I, I -
	if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care
	can't...Excuse me. I believe you have my stapler?
PORTER	looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.
	wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.
SLYDELL	terrific, Peter. I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some
	Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.
PORTER	these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...
SLYDELL	
PORTER	here anyway!
SLYDELL	Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.
	gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?
PORTER	gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in
SLYDELL	it's standard operating procedure.
	they know about this yet?
SLYDELL	No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we
PORTER	is a big promotion, Pete.
SLYDELL	
	you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?
SLYDELL	
	
	Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me. on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-
	Well, what are you doing tonight?
	comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is
	no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're
	I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one
	What about it?
	how does it work?
	pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in
	sounds familiar.
	They did this in Superman III.
	What a good movie.
	bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.
	so they check for this now?
	you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're
	right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all
	numbers up their asses.
	Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?
	not worth the risk. I got a good job.
	if you didn't have a good job?
	Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you,
	I'm being promoted.
	
	I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something
	told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.
	is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass
	course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work,
	But Samir does.
	that's not much money, I -
	the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent.
	like Superman III.
	III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to
	your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for
	right! If I'm lucky.
	I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed Aren't you?
	Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.
	Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't
	
	
	I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.
	what do you think?
	thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.
	came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock
	have a question.
	
	in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?
	You sure can.
	I'm gonna do it.
	what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!!
	Let's discuss the plan, all right?
	right.
	right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to
	you guys give me that disk and I'll take it from there. Oh, but
	course.
	
	worry man! I won't tell anybody about this either!
	the fuck is that?!
	don't worry about him. He's cool. All right. Now here's how I see
SLYDELL	congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.
PORTER	we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away.
	that was easy.
	I guess it was.
	did you do with the -
	guys.
	hey Drew.
	you guys hear about Tom Smykowski?
	guy who got laid off?
	man, check this out.
	
	IS HE DEAD?!
	BUT THAT WIFE OF HIS COMES HOME EARLY FROM WORK EARLY AND FOUND
	I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE SHIFTER HERE. IT'S JAMMED. I,
SMYKOWSKI	you ok, Tom?
	
	AND THEN, AS HE'S LOOKING AT HER, HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO LIVE.
	ok.
SMYKOWSKI	
	seems to be working now. See ya later, honey. Love ya.
	BUT THEN AS HE BACKS OUT INTO HIS DRIVEWAY, HE'S SLAMMED BIG TIME
	is he ok?
	of. He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his
	our last day at Initech.
	can't believe they had security escort us out. Not like we're gonna
	stole something.
	yeah. I guess we all did.
	I stole something else.
	did you steal?
	call it a going away present.
	is going to be ok. Ok?
	one I see is -
	can see this working. I gotta go. I gotta go. Joanna's coming over.
	BACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION...
	what were you guys celebrating last night?
	I'm not really at liberty to talk about it. I really can't.
	when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these
	you're stealing.
	no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh,
	So you're gonna make a lot of money, right?
	
	That's not yours?
	it, it becomes ours.
	that not stealing?
	don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this
	the crippled children?!
	that's the tray. I'm talking about the tray. The penny's for
	for everybody. Ok.
	well, those are whole pennies.
	
	I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it
	seems wrong.
	not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all
	but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the
	know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear
	
	we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go
	
	Samir! How are you doing?
	Tom.
	Tom.
	I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands)
	Michael.

	How are ya? I'm glad you could make it.
	Hi! This is someone I'd like you to meet. This is Joanna.
	
	Forgive me for not getting up. (He starts laughing and everyone
	what do you think? It's a prototype.
	that's exactly as you described it. Uh, listen, I, I heard about
	thanks, Peter. y'know, I'm glad you're here because I wanted to to you. I know how you get depressed about your job and all, and I
	
	Oh maybe I didn't whine as much, but I hated my job as much as
	
	remember
	Tom.
	sure.
	visits? Not that I know of. Now, a minimum security prison is
	no, we were just seeing -

	what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I just don't know if this is
	YEAH? WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SLEEP
	What are you - Oh! All right, Lumbergh...

	That's it. I'm done. I want to get out of the car. Stop. I wanna
