CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
KALE (V.O.)	Do you think he sees us?
JEFF (V.O.)	No, he can't see us. But he feels us watching.
KALE	Whoa, did you see that thing?
JEFF	Settle down, slow it down...
JEFF	You don't want to scare him off. You've got his attention, now just play with him. Tease him a little.
KALE	Holy shit!
JEFF	It's all you, Kale, keep cranking!
KALE	I need reinforcements!
JEFF	Heave, laddie!
JEFF (CONT'D)	Give it all ya got, mate, or you're gonna lose him!
KALE	Dad, your pirate -- impersonation -- sucks!!
JEFF	How would ya know, have ya ever met one? I doubt it --
KALE	He's freakin' pulling us in!
JEFF	Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a fight -- to a fish!
JEFF (CONT'D)	Throw me a --
JEFF (CONT'D)	Hey, at least the weather's great... we're spending quality time together.
KALE	That fish is going down.
JEFF	Let's nab the bastard. Hey mom, it's us. Listen, fire up the grill 'cause the Bassmasters are headed home!
JULIE	You're kidding. So I can actually put the burgers away this time?
KALE	Yes, be gone with the red meat!
JEFF	We're having fish for a week.
JEFF (CONT'D)	I'd say an hour. Love you, too.
KALE	DAD --
JEFF	Kale? -- Kale, are you okay?
KALE	I think so.
KALE	Oh my God, dad --
JEFF	I'm fine. But you're gonna have to climb out, Kale. Can you do that?
KALE	I can't -- It won't give --
JEFF	That's okay, I've got it -- grab the door, I don't need your ass falling on my face --
KALE	Dad, here -- Dad, please, you can do it --
JEFF	Kale, you have to climb up --
KALE	No -- I'm not leaving --
JEFF	Kale --
KALE	NO -- Dad, please, I've got you --
JEFF	I know --

SENOR GUTIERREZ	Senor Brecht...
RONNIE	Dude --
SENOR GUTIERREZ	So Kale, think you can stay conscious long enough to tell us your plans for the three wondrous summer months ahead?
KALE	Este invierno --
SENOR GUTIERREZ	Verano...
KALE	Este verano -- voy a --
SENOR GUTIERREZ	¿Qué?
SR GUTIERREZ SR GUTIERREZ (CONT'D)	¿Qué usted va a hacer? (subtitled) What are you going to do?
KALE	I don't know, alright? I haven't gotten that far.
SENOR GUTIERREZ	Did you do the homework or not?
KALE	Guess not.
SENOR GUTIERREZ	You "guess" not. I don't know who you think you are or who you think you're dealing with. You can't give me a straight answer, fine, give me one good reason why I shouldn't fail you right now?
JUDGE	Okay, Mr. Brecht...
JUDGE (CONT'D)	You're six months shy of eighteen, that means the assault-two charge you've pled guilty to carries a max of one year in juvey. With these priors, you're up to three.
JUDGE (CONT'D)	But losing a parent isn't easy. Which is why I'm sentencing you to three months house arrest.
JUDGE (CONT'D)	You can thank your counselors and lawyer later. Mr. Brecht, I just cut you a break. Don't test me.
PARKER	Okay, you... are all set... to go nowhere. Now, green means you're good, you're in the safe zone which covers about
PARKER (CONT'D)	a sixty-foot radius from this guy here.
PARKER (CONT'D)	He's like a modem. He gets a constant signal from Mr. Bracelet that he sends through your phone line to the monitoring station downtown. So they know where you are, where you've been and what you're thinkin' 25/7.
JULIE	What if he accidentally goes beyond --
PARKER	Red light flashes. Means you've got about ten seconds to get your butt back to green, or else --
KALE	The execution squad shows up?
PARKER	And they don't bring blindfolds. It's also tamper proof and waterproof. So don't try sticking your foot in a bucket of water and hopping across the line. It won't work, and you'll look stupid. Now, I'll be checking up on you a lot. Here's my card -- You're set up to pay his incarceration fee, Ms. Brecht?
JULIE	Automatic withdrawal. Twelve bucks every day.
PARKER	Everything else is in the manual. Oh, except this -- House arrest might sound like a breeze, but trust me, I've seen all kinds of folks get a bit loopy before too long, some after just a day or two. So make sure you find lots of constructive things to keep yourself busy.
KALE	Hobby, you read me? I said come around my left flank and draw his fire -- damn straight I'm trying to get you smoked, you've been hiding behind my ass the whole game --
KALE (CONT'D)	Hobby, Jet, you guys still there?
JULIE	Dinner's on the table. I'm closing at the restaurant the next few nights. Could be some late ones, but hey... the extra tips couldn't hurt.
JULIE (CONT'D)	Where's my apron... apron...
JULIE (CONT'D)	You wanna talk about anything?
KALE	I got nothin'.
JULIE	Y'know, when we're finally free of all this legal stuff with the accident, the other families' lawyers... there might be a little insurance money left... maybe you should go back and see Dr. Phillips?
KALE	What, so he can tell me I'm ADD, have PTSD, and severe IAD?
JULIE	IAD?
KALE	Freakin' irritated ankle disorder.
JULIE	Well, that one could've been avoided.
JULIE (CONT'D)	Do the dishes. Please?
KALE	C'mon, bid a dollar, one dollar --
CONTESTANT (ON TV)	I'll bid one dollar, Bob. it again. Same thing. Then -- like we all do to be sure,
JULIE	More trash TV?
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)	...Thirty-three year old Patricia Walsh was last seen three nights ago...
KALE	News.
JULIE	The lawyer's sending some papers over.
KALE	And your point is?
JULIE	I've got two open houses, you've gotta sign for them. That's the point.
KALE	You canceled my Xbox subscription. I-tunes, too. You know what else I'm canceling?
JULIE (CONT'D)	Maid service. Sorry, you're a felon. And we're broke. I can't do it all, anymore, Kale. This isn't gonna be vacation as usual. I want these washed and the kitchen cleaned by the time I get home.
KALE	That might be difficult.
JULIE	Well let me make it easier.
KALE	That's a little dramatic, isn't it? I'm just gonna plug it back --
KALE (CONT'D)	What are you, mental?
JULIE	One more look at that kitchen and I will be. You heard what I said about the lawyer?
KALE	Yes!
KALE	Dammit, Ronnie, I'm losing my mind.
KALE (CONT'D)	Give me some details, what's happening out there? Dude, the chicks here in Oahu rock the houusse! Oh my god, this one is totally showing me her kite board. Belay that, she wasn't pointing at me. Look, Kale, I've gotta hop --
KALE	Wait, Ronnie -- Hello?
KALE	GODDAMMIT!
KALE	I'm coming!!
KALE	Oh shit! Shit water shit!
BRAT #1	What a retard!
KALE	You think that's funny?
BRAT #2	What are you gonna do, kill us like your teacher?
KALE	Not before I shove this shit up your ass! Dude, you said he couldn't leave his house!!
KALE	Shit!
KALE (CONT'D)	Turn green turn green turn green...
KALE (CONT'D)	No, c'mon, I'm way inside, turn green --
KALE (CONT'D)	Yes! That's what I'm talking about!
KALE (CONT'D)	It's cool, I'm all green.
PARKER (V.O.)	Kale, calm down, the officers were probably in the neighborhood already.
KALE	Okay, fine, but if I'd known --
PARKER (V.O.)	Kale, first times happen. The officers knew that. But next time they will take you to jail.
COURIER	Hi, I'm from McNeill-Stewart law firm, dropping off for Ms. Julie --
KALE	Hey doggie, come here...
KALE (CONT'D)	Hey, you and me both.
RONNIE	Aloooha Senor Ka-- Dude, you look like hell.
RONNIE	Seriously man, you need some sun. Hey, I've gotta show you this. Maui chicks rule.
KALE	I've got something to show you, too. I mean... there's such structure to it, so many layers, but it's invisible if you're not looking close enough...
RONNIE	What are you talking about?
KALE	The world right outside the window.
RONNIE	-- Fascinating.
KALE	Just wait... and... Three... two... one... dog...
KALE (CONT'D)	...Mrs. Pilch... saying goodbye to Lonnie...
RONNIE	Husband?
KALE	Maid.
KALE (CONT'D)	Four o'clock every Thursday, she goes to the country club to play tennis with Betty Big-Bangs there.
KALE (CONT'D)	And... ladies disappear... cue white Mercedes... Mr. Pilch... arriving from the office...
RONNIE	Great, that still doesn't explain why you're in a bathrobe at four in the afternoon.
KALE	Will you just look --
RONNIE	Dude, he's gonna see --
KALE	He can't. We don't have any lights on. Plus the angle's sharper from ground level, it only seems like he could see us. I did the math.
RONNIE	Oh, you did the math.
KALE	Optical illusion, line-of-sight doesn't apply to the subject.
RONNIE	Kale --
KALE	Now tilt your gaze up...
RONNIE	DAMN!!
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Seal this area off, Kale.
KALE	C'mon, there's more.
RONNIE	What, I go to Maui, you become a stalker?
KALE	No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations... natural side effects of chronic boredom.
RONNIE	Find your passion, Kale.
KALE	So... Robert Giles...
KALE (CONT'D)	He's lived there a couple of years, but I've never noticed he mows his lawn every two days.
RONNIE	Huh, I guess he likes his grass short.
KALE	Next to him is Judy Thorp. Dude, she freakin' sneaks over to her neighbors' every morning, steals their newspaper, I guess reads it or swipes the coupons, then puts it back before they even wake up.
RONNIE	No shit? People. You never can tell these days.
RONNIE	What was that?
KALE	Last stop on the tour.
RONNIE	Oh-- my-- God. Who be she?
KALE	Don't know.
RONNIE	What's stopping you?!
ASHLEY	Can I help you?
KALE	Nope, no I'm fine.
ASHLEY	Too late.
KALE	Thanks, that was really humiliating.
ASHLEY	Please. I think any pride you had left was gone a while ago.
KALE	Oh, you mean that thing with the cops? They had the wrong guy, total foul up. I'm Kale by the way.
KALE (CONT'D)	Hey, so -- how'd the move go?
ASHLEY	Still going.
KALE	I'd help, but... I'm a little spatially challenged at the moment.
ASHLEY	Yeah, you've kinda got the whole Martha Stewart thing going on --
KALE	But minus the 48-hour allowance for office visits. And no lame "Apprentice" spin-off. So where'd you move from?
ASHLEY	I'm a city girl. Born, raised, and now... Forcefully relocated.
KALE	That doesn't sound good.
ASHLEY	I'm telling you, if I have another clueless jock hit on me or one more soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize SUV, I'm gonna go postal.
KALE	Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if you wanted to hop in my Hummer and cruise to a kegger. Nice talking to you.
ASHLEY	Wait, I -- Ashley? Can you come in here, please?
ASHLEY	My mom -- she's very polite, always says "please" but she's got that tone, did you notice?
KALE	I know the tone.
ASHLEY	Oh, I'm Ashley --
KALE	Noticed that, too.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)	...attended a friend's birthday party at a local nightclub before she was last seen alone at a diner outside Madison, 50 miles east of here. A waitress said Ms. Walsh was picked up around 10:30 P.M. by an unidentified person driving a black 1960's era Mustang that was dented on the left side and may have --
KALE	You started without me? What are you stopping for?
KALE (CONT'D)	No --
KALE (CONT'D)	Whoa.
KALE	-- Mustang -- Holy shit. A dent --
KALE (CONT'D) JULIE	Jesus, mom! Christ, Kale!
JULIE (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I thought you heard me...
KALE	What? No, I --
JULIE	What's going on?
KALE	Nothing, just watching the wind blow.
JULIE	Anything else?
KALE	No, see for yourself.
JULIE	That's okay, I just... wanted to say good night. So you don't know what year the Mustang is?
KALE	'65 or '66, couldn't tell.
RONNIE	Check this out. The feds think your missing girl might be related to three murders in Austin. All redheads.
KALE	Movement.
KALE (CONT'D)	Better late than never.
RONNIE	Dude...
RONNIE (CONT'D)	DUDE!!
KALE	That's definitely new.
RONNIE	Oh, it's so warm, baby...
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Cleansing breath...
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Concentrate now. This is for the gold.
KALE	Jackass!
RONNIE	Dude, there's no way she heard that.
KALE	Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard that.
RONNIE	She's got great lung capacity.
KALE	I think she saw me --
RONNIE	There's no way --
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Okay, maybe she did.
KALE	Seriously?
RONNIE	Her swims always that short?
KALE	No, she usually takes her time --
RONNIE	Now where is she?
KALE RONNIE	No. No.
RONNIE	Don't, it could be her!
KALE	It's not gonna be her.
RONNIE	Then stop! Just -- let 'em go away.
KALE	I have to.
RONNIE	What?! What?! Speak.
KALE	It's her.
RONNIE	You're full of --
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Shit shit!! Oh my shit!
KALE	She totally saw us --
RONNIE	We are so busted. Don't answer it!
KALE	Dude, she knows I'm here.
ASHLEY	What took you so long? The house isn't that big.
KALE	Yeah, no, we were playing upstairs --
RONNIE	Video games...?
KALE	So... what brings you here.
ASHLEY	Oh. -- Locked out.
KALE	Do you need to call anyone?
ASHLEY	Thanks, but I'd rather stay stranded if you don't mind. May I?
KALE	Uh, sure, come on in --
KALE (CONT'D)	That's Ronnie.
ASHLEY	Nice to meet you. Video games, huh? I like to play.
KALE	Excuse me...
KALE	It's a little messy.
ASHLEY	A little?
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Anything interesting out there?
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale?
RONNIE	Actually, he is.
RONNIE (CONT'D)	See, he has this neighbor -- who I guess by definition would also be your neighbor -- who may, in point of fact, be a cold-blooded killer.
ASHLEY	Is that so.
RONNIE	Exhibit A, Robert Giles.
ASHLEY	Yeah, I've seen him. So?
KALE	So you hear about that missing girl from Madison?
ASHLEY	What, you think he --
KALE	He drives a car like the one she was seen in.
RONNIE	Black Mustang.
KALE	60's era Mustang.
ASHLEY	Gee, that really narrows it down.
KALE	They said it was dented. His has a bashed-in fender.
ASHLEY	So this is why -- you're --
RONNIE	What?
KALE	Hey --
ASHLEY	So that's the infamous black mustang, huh?
KALE	Yeah --
ASHLEY	The one with no dent?
KALE	What?
KALE (CONT'D)	How'd he fix it so fast --
ASHLEY	Because it was never there in the first place?
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Sorry guys, no bashed-in fender, just a Longhorns bumper sticker.
KALE	You serious? She's right.
KALE (CONT'D)	They think it might be linked to some murders in Texas two years ago.
RONNIE	Austin, Texas. Texas Longhorns.
ASHLEY	Okay, fine, stakeout. Who's on my shift?
RONNIE	This is all the stuff I could find --
ASHLEY	Do you know how long Giles has lived there?
KALE	About two or three years.
ASHLEY	So he could've lived in Texas... Hey, check this out.
RONNIE	"Murderer: Tell Tale Signs of a Serial Killer." Qualifies for free shipping if you pair it with "The Shrine of Jeffrey Dahmer."
ASHLEY	The summary lists four main criteria. Our guy meets at least three. White male between the age of twenty-five and fifty. He doesn't have any pets, right?
KALE	Not that I've seen --
ASHLEY	You said he lives alone --
RONNIE	What's the fourth?
ASHLEY	Sexual dysfunction.
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	I'm hungry, let's order pizza.
KALE	He's been gone awhile.
ASHLEY	Here.
KALE	How'd you get my phone?
ASHLEY	I'm crafty like that.
KALE	What'd you do?
ASHLEY	Every time he calls, that's what you'll hear.
KALE	What the hell?
KALE (CONT'D)	Where's --
ASHLEY	Three to one he doesn't pick it up.
KALE	So that's why the grass is greener...
ASHLEY	Only in disturbia...
KALE	So why the move?
ASHLEY	What do you mean? The greener grass, the safer pastures...
KALE	No, seriously.
ASHLEY	Well, I guess my mom thought it'd help keep dad on a shorter leash. City life... had its temptations... But my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care -- more than ever.
KALE	What did they think, an extra bathroom and two-car garage would actually change things... somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape?
ASHLEY	Something like that. So... what're your issues, Kale?
KALE	That's him.
ASHLEY	Another car --
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	You seen her before?
KALE	No.
ASHLEY	Cute for a killer.
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Who said chivalry's dead?
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	There's a club girl for you.
KALE	How do you know?
ASHLEY	Bright green bracelet's "The Pyramids," purple's "Club 360," the big black stamp's from "Flavor."
KALE	Missing girl was seen at a club. Didn't say which one though... Your I.D. must be pretty good.
ASHLEY	I don't need one.
KALE	He's going in.
ASHLEY	Denied...
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Oh no, he put on music...
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Oh, c'mon, Giles, all she wants to do is dance.
KALE	What do you think they're listening to?
ASHLEY	Could be radio. See if you can find the station.
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	No... no...
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Stop.
RONNIE	Hmmm...
ASHLEY	Now's the time to bust your move.
RONNIE	Who's that?
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Ookay, just fill me in later. A pleasure. Duude! Later.
ASHLEY	It's my mom. Hi. No, I'm fine. I'm at Barnes and Noble. Okay, I'm leaving. No, I'll walk.
KALE	And she's down for the count.
ASHLEY	Looks like this is as far as you go.
KALE	Looks like.
ASHLEY	Y'know, I have to admit, you're different than I expected.
KALE	What were you expecting?
ASHLEY	I thought you'd be more messed up.
KALE	Does that disappoint you? 'Cause I can be more messed up if you want me to.
ASHLEY	No, you're fine.
KALE	"Fine?"
ASHLEY	Yeah.
KALE	"Fine" like your first cousin "fine" or "fine" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way?
GILES	Just come back in the house, you shouldn't drive -- He wants her to come back in --
KALE	I can't hear --
ASHLEY	Let's get closer --
KALE	I can't --
GILES	You really should stay.
WOMAN	I just don't think it's a good idea -- Where the hell are they?
WOMAN (CONT'D)	Here --
GILES	You're in no condition --
WOMAN	Give me my keys.
GILES	Sorry.
GILES (CONT'D)	C'mon...
KALE	Ashley, come on...
ASHLEY	That was intense.
KALE	Are you nuts?!
KALE	Mom?
KALE	Dammit.
KALE (CONT'D)	Shit! Dumbass dumbass -- Okay, so where is she -- Oh shit oh shit...
KALE (CONT'D)	Ronnie -- Dude, Ashley is ho-ho-hotttt --
KALE	Giles totally busted me. What do you mean, are you sure?
KALE	They were arguing -- Who?
KALE	Giles and the girl he brought home. They had an argument, he grabbed her --
RONNIE (V.O.)	And then what?
KALE	And then -- nothing.
RONNIE (V.O.)	Uh-huh.
KALE	Dude, something is going on over there. What if he killed her, too?
RONNIE (V.O.)	Then call your friends at the police department.
KALE	Wait -- What?
KALE	A door just slammed. That's right, Kale, and now I'm coming up to slash your guts out, you little bastard!
KALE	Asshole, I'm serious.
RONNIE (V.O.)	I'm not and I'm hanging up.
KALE	Just -- wait -- wait till I check the hall -- BOO!
KALE	Goddamn you!!
JULIE	Kale, Kale, it's me!!
KALE	No, don't!
JULIE	What's going on, who were you talking to?!
KALE	Ronnie -- just Ronnie.
KALE (CONT'D)	I heard the door --
JULIE	I'm sorry, the wind caught it --
KALE	Fine. Good. Okay --
JULIE	Okay then, so... You want anything from the grocery? I'm going in the morning.
KALE	Anything caffeinated.
GILES	Whoa, whoa, settle down, slow down. Robert Giles, your neighbor -- Behind you?
KALE	I know, how did you --
GILES	Think I startled him.
JULIE	Oh. Kale, I ran into Mr. Giles at --
GILES	Robert...
JULIE	...At the grocery. I had a flat tire when I came out. We tried to change it, but --
KALE	Dad put those security bolts on --
JULIE	And that adapter thingy that unscrews it ended up stripping it instead --
GILES	My fault.
JULIE	No, it wasn't. You saved my life. We had it towed to Frank's.
KALE	Gee, really lucky you were there.
GILES	Just glad I could help. Must be a little difficult when the man of the house is stuck in the house.
JULIE	Oh... no, it's okay, we're managing.
GILES	I've always been curious about those things, do you mind?
KALE	Yeah, I do.
JULIE	Oh c'mon, Kale. I'm sorry.
GILES	No, no. It's none of my business.
KALE	That's right.
GILES	Whoa, hey, dude... you seem like a straight hitter. You ask me, whoever they are deserved it.
JULIE	Okay... I don't think that's the case, and --
KALE	I think I'd like to hear his opinion.
GILES	And I think I opened my big mouth again. You're absolutely right. I should go.
JULIE	Wait, what about your coffee?
KALE	I popped my Spanish teacher.
GILES	In that case, cafe con leche, por favor?
JULIE	Shoot, milk's... still in the car.
KALE	I like your shirt, by the way. I mean, the color.
GILES	Which one?
KALE	Oh, the... that dark orange. Always reminds me of Texas.
GILES	Yeah? You a Longhorns fan, too?
KALE	Sure, absolutely. Even though I've never stepped foot in Texas --
GILES	Me neither. Had a lot of friends who went there. I stayed in Minnesota till I moved here.
KALE	Huh.
GILES	So when you say you "popped" your teacher --
KALE	Just a black eye.
GILES	Phew, just making sure I wasn't living next to some psycho killer. Listen, I get it though. I had plenty of teachers I wanted to just... kill.
GILES (CONT'D)	But no matter how hard it is to hold back, the high road's always the better choice.
JULIE	Kale, could you grab the sugar? Sugar?
GILES	Why not.
GILES (CONT'D)	Thanks, man.
GILES (CONT'D)	Oh, hey, Kale... Nice to finally meet you. Oooh. That's creepy.
KALE	I know, he's a total freak, right?
ASHLEY	And very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a "sinister message?"
KALE	Are you messing with me?
ASHLEY	Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair?
KALE	So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car --
ASHLEY	With the non dent dent --
KALE	The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen --
ASHLEY	Why, because he slashed your mom's tire?
KALE	Maybe. Her car hasn't moved.
ASHLEY	It's called "the day after," Kale. Nobody moves after a night like that.
KALE	Well what if she's really "not moving?" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death --
ASHLEY	Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me.
KALE	You're leaving?
ASHLEY	Have to. Party.
KALE	Whose?
ASHLEY	Uh, mine?
KALE	How is that possible?
ASHLEY	Excuse me?
KALE	Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody --
ASHLEY	I don't, I didn't -- I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?
KALE	Oh my god, "Skinny Psycho?!" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish --
ASHLEY	I told her my parents were outta town --
KALE	And now the whole neighborhood's coming.
ASHLEY	Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it.
KALE	Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain.
ASHLEY	Kale, you're welcome to come, but --
KALE	Well, I appreciate the thought. Really.
ASHLEY	Glad to hear it.
KALE	It's funny, though.
ASHLEY	What?
KALE	I didn't peg you as a conformist.
ASHLEY	Try to keep these in your drawers tonight, will ya?
RONNIE	This is Ronnie, leave a message.
KALE	Yeah, I'm calling about the Jeep Cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug -- it's ready? Listen, did they have to replace the whole tire -- they patched it? Is there any way to tell if it was slashed or -- But a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile, doesn't it? I mean it's a really slow leak, it can't flatten a tire in twenty minutes. -- Yeah, I guess anything's possible. Wait, what was that? You think I'm watching? Well, I'm not... Nope, I am minding my own business...
KALE (CONT'D)	You think I'm buying that? I'm not biting --
KALE (CONT'D)	That's it.
KALE	Hey!
ASHLEY	Oh my God --
ASHLEY	Back off or I'll throw it where you can't follow.
KALE	Take it easy, that's sixty gigs of my life.
ASHLEY	Even better.
KALE	Okay -- okay --
ASHLEY	What are you doing?
KALE	What are you doing?
ASHLEY	I'm trying to enjoy my party. Wait, that's wrong. According to you, I'm trying to conform --
KALE	Coulda fooled me.
ASHLEY	What does that mean?
KALE	Forget --
ASHLEY	No, I'm not gonna forget it.
KALE	You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me.
ASHLEY	So you were watching me. Question is for how long? Just tonight? Or maybe a week? Two weeks? Since I moved in? And the whole "my-neighbor's-the- killer" thing. Great cover --
KALE	It's not a cover --
ASHLEY	So what is it, Kale? Huh? What else have you seen?
KALE	What else have I seen?
ASHLEY	Yeah. What else?
KALE	Okay -- I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this... when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just... when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so you know -- I get it.
KALE (CONT'D)	But I've also seen those designer window shades of yours, and guess what? They always go up the next day -- no matter what. And even if no one else has, I've noticed that. And I ain't sorry. The only thing I'll even consider apologizing for is... not dropping the binoculars and telling you this a lot sooner.
ASHLEY	That was either the creepiest... or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
KALE	Hey.
ASHLEY	Hey... where have you been?
KALE	If would have gone to the flower shop, but --
ASHLEY	I know.
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	So how much longer?
KALE	Oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen hours give or take. You know the other night... when you said you thought I'd be more messed up...
ASHLEY	...For a guy who killed his teacher.
KALE	I didn't kill my --
ASHLEY	Shhh. I know. -- I know.
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	Oh my God, what time is it?
KALE	Three-thirty.
ASHLEY	I've gotta go.
KALE	You better see this.
KALE (CONT'D)	Look, quick --
ASHLEY	What?
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	That's normal.
KALE	Her car... still hasn't moved...
ASHLEY	So what do you wanna do?
RONNIE	You want me to do what?
KALE	Phase one, steal his code from his opener.
RONNIE	There's more than one phase?
KALE	There's only two. Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. "On" or "off."
RONNIE	For the later purpose of doing what? Breaking in to his house?
KALE	No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag --
RONNIE	All this sounds reasonable to you?
ASHLEY	I don't know about that, but --
KALE	This is good up to thirteen digits --
RONNIE	How long have you been planning this?
KALE	Look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. He takes twenty-one minutes average to mow his front yard... you'll be hearing him the whole time...
ASHLEY	I'll do it.
RONNIE	No. It isn't safe. Let's do it.
KALE	Yo, you set? I can't believe I'm doing this.
KALE	Let me conference Ashley in. Ashley, you there? Ten-four.
KALE	Nice.
KALE (CONT'D)	Okay, Ron -- Green light. You're all good.
RONNIE (V.O.)	Oww, shit --
KALE	You okay -- What do you think?
KALE	Dude, glove compartment, other side.
RONNIE (V.O.)	Excuse me if I'm used to my mom's import. Can I just try this one while I'm here?
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Shit.
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Shit. They're all gonna be locked --
KALE	Well, while you're there, will you just check?
RONNIE (V.O.)	I'm in.
KALE	You see the package? Oh my God -- What's wrong?
RONNIE (V.O.)	There's like a month-old order of Nachos Bell Grande under the seat. Okay, I found it.
KALE	Whenever you're ready.
RONNIE (V.O.)	Looks like "on, on, on, off, off, on..." No wait, that one was "off."
KALE	Just start over. "On, on, on, off, off, off, on -- "
KALE	No, no --
RONNIE (V.O.)	I'll get it right this time.
KALE	Ronnie, he's coming around.
RONNIE (V.O.)	Dude, stop dicking with me, I still hear his --
KALE	Ronnie, I am not dicking with you. The neighbor is also mowing her lawn and he's going to see you --
RONNIE (V.O.)	Kale, what do I do?! Where --
KALE	GET IN THE CAR!!
KALE (CONT'D)	Put the remote back -- I did, I did --
KALE	Easy on the door. Don't panic, he's coming straight for you -- What?! Kale, you've gotta get me --
KALE	Back seat, NOW!
KALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Ashley -- I'm on it.
RONNIE	Kale, tell my mom --
KALE	Shut up, stay down and don't move. Ronnie, you're good -- Ronnie?
KALE (CONT'D)	Ronnie, was that the whole code? Ronnie?
KALE (CONT'D)	Okay, Ashley, you're good, come on...
KALE (CONT'D)	Was that the whole code?
RONNIE	Excuse me?
KALE	The code, did you get it?
RONNIE	You've gotta be kidding.
KALE	No way.
RONNIE	Great, Kale. She lives. What are you doing?
KALE	Getting her license number --
RONNIE	Why?
ASHLEY	Okay, case closed.
RONNIE	Try telling Inspector Clouseau that. Now he thinks he needs her license number.
ASHLEY	Why, Kale? It's over.
KALE	"Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me." That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty people --
ASHLEY	Okay, I think we all just need to take a breath.
KALE	Fine, but what about the bumper sticker, there's still a girl missing, just... what's in the bag? Can anyone tell me that?
ASHLEY	Kale, why are you so --
KALE	Ronnie, you've seen this satellite website, right? You can find any location on earth and take a picture --
RONNIE	Yeah, for a small fee --
ASHLEY	Kale, what are you doing?
KALE	Trying to get to the bottom of this.
ASHLEY	Kale, right now, it doesn't look that way.
KALE	What's it look like?
ASHLEY	Like you're determined to turn Giles in to who you think he is.
KALE	Not who I think.
ASHLEY	I just didn't realize -- you were this --
KALE	What, crazy? Maybe I am. But maybe I'm right.
ASHLEY	It's not about that, it's about -- -- What I see. What Ronnie and I are seeing right now. I see a guy who looks like he hasn't slept in days. I'm seeing you sitting at your dad's desk -- -- Because you lost him before maybe... you ever really knew him. Before the world according to Kale took a hit from that same stuff you were telling me about, remember? All those curveballs? But it's like -- it's like you're still trying to dodge them by forcing pieces together that are never gonna fit... by getting all wrapped up in... This. Obsessing's not gonna "protect you," Kale. It's not gonna make the hurt go away.
KALE	Are you two gonna help me or not?
ASHLEY	I want to.
KALE	Then start looking through these --
ASHLEY	That's not what I meant.
KALE	Well, this is all I need, so -- I guess I'll see you later. So what's your deal? You hanging out or not?
RONNIE	I would, dude, but -- I've gotta pull it together and -- change my underwear. Catch you later?
KALE	Sure.
KALE	Get off me, man.
RONNIE	Dude -- my cell phone's -- still in his car.
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Kale, did you hear me?
KALE	Ronnie, I know you think I'm losing my mind, but... listen, I'll help you get it, I just need you to do one thing.
RONNIE	Phase two. I knew it.
KALE	You read?
RONNIE (V.O.)	Yeah, you got a signal?
KALE	Got video, no audio.
RONNIE (V.O.)	Yeah, mic's on the fritz. How am I looking?
KALE	Light on, far end. I guess it's now or never. Moving out.
KALE	No movement.
RONNIE (V.O.)	First hurdle --
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Twenty feet. Ten feet -- Garage --
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Bingo. I'm not seeing it --
KALE	Stay calm, it's there.
RONNIE (V.O.)	I've got it.
KALE	You're still clear, check the bag.
RONNIE (V.O.)	Hang on --
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	I'm setting the camera on the trunk.
KALE	Try to get the plate number of the Mustang and check for dents --
RONNIE (V.O.)	I'm checking the bag first. It does look like blood -- and hair --
KALE	The camera's sliding --
RONNIE (V.O.)	That was close.
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Oh shit --
KALE	Ronnie?
RONNIE	-- make it -- interference -- somebody's here --
KALE	Ronnie?! He's in the house -- Ronnie?
KALE (CONT'D)	What the hell --
KALE (CONT'D)	RONNIE! Shit --
KALE	Ronnie?!
KALE (CONT'D)	Ronnie, can you hear me?! Giles, open the door!!
KALE	Hey!
UNIFORM #1	Freeze. Hands above your head, now!!
KALE	Please, my friend's been kidnapped, he's in this house -- he's inside, I think the owner's trying to kill him --
UNIFORM #1	Stay right there.
UNIFORM #2	I've got it --
UNIFORM #1	Dispatch, 13A74, we're 10-26 with the kid, he's claiming a 10-31 at... 4710 Fairway Court. House behind his residence, request 10-78. 13A74, ten-four, units already in the area, will advise --
UNIFORM #2	It's open.
KALE	It was already open.
GILES	Uh, yes, can I help you, officer?
UNIFORM #2	Sorry to wake you, sir, we have a young man here claiming a friend of his is in your house. Would you know anything about that?
GILES	No, I certainly wouldn't.
KALE	You're a lying son of a bitch!
UNIFORM #1	Take it easy --
KALE	He's in there, goddammit! He's inside! He's lying!
UNIFORM #1	Sir, calm down --
KALE	Okay, but he's lying -- he has my friend, and he kidnapped that girl last week, he killed maybe three others, all redheads, they could be in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag -- in his garage -- my friend knew this -- That's why he's covering -- he didn't just wake up five minutes ago --
UNIFORM #1	Can you --
UNIFORM #2	Sir, do you mind if we take a look inside?
GILES	Absolutely, be my guest.
GILES	I hit it the other night. Thought I'd save a few steps and get it off the road myself. I was gonna bury it sooner, but it's been a helluva week --
KALE	So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood --
GILES	Because it's a classic, I got it out of storage for the auto show, I needed it in pristine condition. It's one of the biggest in the world. The auto show.
UNIFORM #1	I think we're done here. Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
GILES	Please, I understand.
KALE	So where's my friend, then? Can anyone tell me that? Does anyone believe me?!
JULIE	Kale, come on --
JULIE	I'm sorry, Kale.
JULIE (CONT'D)	I really am. You know, one thing I always told myself was that no matter what, I would always know what was going on with my kid --
KALE	Mom --
JULIE	Let me finish -- because I have to tell you something... I feel like I let you down. I was too caught up in my own grief to see straight. I thought time would heal this and taking a second job was... the answer to keeping a roof over our heads --
KALE	It was --
JULIE	That's just wood. Do you hear me? We're still not through this -- obviously -- it's gonna take more time -- maybe a lot more time -- and that's just gotta be okay, because I know -- it'll get better. I want us to be us again. I want us to be honest with each other like we used to be. Is that possible?
KALE	Yeah. I just -- didn't think you'd believe me --
JULIE	Listen to me. I am always on your side. No matter what. It may not look like it sometimes, but it's the truth. And we'll get through this. Okay?
KALE	OH MY GOD -- Shit --
KALE (CONT'D)	Ronnie --
RONNIE	BOO!
RONNIE (CONT'D)	Dude, don't kill me, don't kill me -- I can explain --
KALE	How -- How long have you been here?
RONNIE	You should have seen your face -- I got out his front door. I got lucky. I heard you yelling, but dude, cops were everywhere --
KALE	Still, you could have --
RONNIE	What, popped out and said, "oh yeah, officers, my friend's right, I was just in that house, I'd gone to get my cell phone out of the guy's car I broke into earlier..." Are you kidding me?
KALE	I get it.
RONNIE	Dude, I am sorry. Can we just... hug it out?
KALE	Why didn't Giles tell the cops someone broke in? I mean, he did see you, right?
RONNIE	You know, let's be positive for a change. I thought he did, but maybe he didn't. Or maybe he's a nice guy afterall, and he didn't wanna make a big deal of it, you know? I mean, he's a guy, he was a kid once...
KALE	What if he wasn't always a guy?
RONNIE	But I do have to ask... what was in the bag?
KALE	Dead deer.
RONNIE	Naturally... Hey, you want more evidence, detective?
KALE	I was watching, remember?
RONNIE	No, no, this is comedy, it deserves big screen treatment.
RONNIE	Hey, I caught that.
KALE	So that's when the garage door started closing.
RONNIE	Yeah, he must have heard me. He came through the inside door -- This is where I ducked low and started...
RONNIE (CONT'D)	...hauling aaaass...
KALE	That's great.
RONNIE	Dropped it.
KALE	Yeah, I lost signal --
RONNIE	But I never leave evidence behind. And that's about when you started yelling bloody murder and the shit hit the fan.
RONNIE (CONT'D)	I'm starving. All that running around...
KALE	I'm gonna burn this.
KALE (CONT'D)	You're not fooling me, Giles...
KALE	Ronnie, get your ass up here!
KALE	Ronnie?!
KALE	Ronnie -- MOM!!
GILES	You finally wanna be an orphan?
GILES	If you don't stop fighting me, I will gut her like a fish.
GILES	So where's the tape?
GILES (CONT'D)	You're right, I'll find it later.
GILES (CONT'D)	It's funny, I hear a lot of authors say their first books were easy, it's the second one that's really hard. Wonder if your dad thought that. See with me, it's the opposite. The very first one was... ...Very difficult... she was very beautiful... fragile... a lot of promise... the others in Texas were flings, low class... Patty Walsh had potential, but so did Amy. You saw her, right? When you were watching me? You should feel good, Kale, you guys saved her life. I was headed in to kill her when your girlfriend showed up. So, you're a hero, Kale. Savor the moment. You have Microsoft Word? Turn it on.
GILES (CONT'D)	I can type, you know. "Dear Ashley... I killed Ronnie and my mom because... What's wrong? Hey, you're the one who couldn't leave me alone. Truthfully, I'm sick of covering my tracks. You think I like spending my spare time looking over my shoulder for people like you? Word of advice, if you ever need to hurt someone, think everything through. Because you do get a taste for it, don't you?
GILES (CONT'D)	But damned if people aren't just waiting to stand in your way... cops, reporters, determined relatives, nosy fucking neighbors... next thing you know, you're on tilt, you can't think straight, you're clocking your teacher in front of the whole class, me... I'm hitting a damned deer... Man, that was some shitty luck. Anyway, it's pretty clear how we've gotta clean this up. The irony is, you've done all the hard stuff. Whaddaya think: "Troubled youth finally snapped." Maybe because he was jealous of his girlfriend, or maybe he just couldn't deal with the guilt from not saving daddy. Hey, you Googled me.
ASHLEY	KALE --
KALE	It's dead.
ASHLEY	Let me try -- Where's your mom --
KALE	Living room -- tied up -- he got Ronnie -- in the kitchen -- GODDAMN YOU!!
ASHLEY	Okay, just -- I'll get your mom, you figure out a way to call the cops --
KALE	No, I've gotta get her --
ASHLEY	Kale, you've gotta get outside, get over the boundary -- do you hear me?
KALE	Okay, but -- just follow my lead -- we're gonna need stuff --
KALE (CONT'D)	Once I have his attention, you go get her.
KALE	We're out here, asshole!
ASHLEY	Kale!
ASHLEY (CONT'D)	NO! You son of a --
KALE	Ashley! Are you okay?
ASHLEY	I wanna kill him --
KALE	Stick to the plan --
KALE	That was a warning!
ASHLEY	Hi, Mrs. Brecht, I'm Ashley -- It's gonna hurt.
JULIE	Where's Kale?
KALE	Where's my mom?
ASHLEY	She went upstairs for you -- where's Giles?
KALE	I don't know -- the cops should be here any sec --
ASHLEY	What's wrong?
KALE	No flashing lights -- stay here --
PARKER	Kale, what's going on now?
KALE	Parker, where's the cavalry?!
PARKER	I told 'em don't bother, you were my responsibility -- right now -- Giles is -- Evening.
KALE	
REPORTER	...the body of Partricia Walsh, missing since last week, has been recovered along with the remains of at least three other women. Authorities say Giles meticulously maintained his yard, mowing the lawn routinely in order to avoid the formation of sinkholes which could have exposed his terrible secret...
KALE	He was my best friend. We always talked about what guys talk about... sports, women... food... We were talking about the freakin' fish -- this huge, amazing black bass we'd just caught -- and how we'd be eating it for a week... the next thing I know -- I can't hold on... and he's letting go... I was so pissed at
KALE (CONT'D)	him, I was so -- he's the one who left, he's the one who gave up, you know? -- But that's b.s. See, the truth is, my dad -- He saved me.
JULIE	You ready?
KALE	Movement.
ASHLEY	Why's your mom doing this again?
KALE	She's whacked. Plain and simple. I think she thought it'd be some sick challenge or something -- hey, commission's the same I guess...
KALE (CONT'D)	No way. She can't be serious.
ASHLEY	Hey, if anyone can spin a psycho house into the opportunity of a lifetime, I'd bet on your mom any day of the week.
KALE	Fine, but we still have to seriously question the yayhoos buying the place.
ASHLEY	Whaddaya think, another stakeout?
KALE	Screw that. My mom has another half hour over there at least.
RONNIE	I'm not even here.
SMASH TO BLACK.
