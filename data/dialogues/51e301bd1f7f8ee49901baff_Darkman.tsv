MAN	They're drivin' up. Black nods.
BLACK	Get their pieces. We got a surprise for those fuckers. We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln Continentals. The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out, eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.

The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there

DURANT	...Two: I don't always succeed. SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger:
DURANT	...Three: I've got seven more points. Looking down on the lonely waterfront building, we hear Black's screams. Making jerky little movements this way and that.
EYE'S POV: AN ENORMOUS NOSE	We pull focus through the nose, then back to sharp focus again. The nose fills the screen, every pore a cavern, every blemish a mountain.
EYE	Blinking.
NOSE	The nostrils flare slightly.
EYE	Looking.
NOSE	Still. Suddenly it is hit by a flash of light as -- B- DEEEE -- we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its B-DEEEEE! B-DEEEE! We get rapid-fire left and right nose profiles.

YAKITITO	fumbles for the stopwatch that hangs around his neck.
YAKITITO	Ninety-eight minute and change.
PEYTON	Let's check in our friends.
PEYTON	moves to a microscope.

PEYTON	Fragmentation. Time? Yakitito checks his stopwatch.
YAKITITO	Ninety-nine minute. Again.
32 CONTINUED	He stares dumbly at the stopwatch, frozen. He repeats,
YAKITITO	..Ninety-nine minute. Cells always break up at a ninety-nine minute. He punches away at a keyboard and takes the readout.
PEYTON	Electrolytes, temp and glucose concentration. all normal.
YAKITITO	But still this ninety nine minute. Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet.
PEYTON	Pacing, thinking;
PEYTON	Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment.
YAKITITO	posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets.
YAKITITO	We already try ten. He pokes at a section of lab sheets.
YAKITITO	And twenty. And twenty-two... We try all phase of alkalinity. He punches the wall. CONTINUED
YAKITITO	But still a ninety-nine minute! Three month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago... ninety nine minute... BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs.
PEYTON	A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object ---
BAM!	He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech.
YAKITITO	Maybe I am lousy scientist.
MAYBEOI	listen to father, get in Anaheim! Get drunk on Sake nightly, forget I am failure!
PEYTON	Quick, Yakitito. A basketball appears in Peyton's hands. He tosses it to

YAKITITO	Throws the ball away.
KE	No, always you ask me question to ma me calm down! I no want to calm down!
PEYTON	catches the ball, dribbles and throws it back to Yakitito.
PEYTON	The answer, Yakitito.
YAXITITO	snags the ball angrily from the air. It is most strongly depending on temperature! He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the ball.
PEYTON	Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches.
YAKITITO	This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks.
YAKITITO	Amazing. It work every time. of aides. JULIE HASTINGS, a young attractive woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair and crosses the lobby to greet them. She is dressed in a

JULIE	Then I guess we're only missing one element here.
KATZ	What's that?
JULIE	An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. Wine is poured around.
JULIE	.Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED
34 CONTINUED	Katz leans forward, listening.
JULIE	...Location. Location. And... location. Frankly, you have none of the above. Your fair price is fair for midtown commercial, not for riverfront.
KATZ	It's worth more to your client, given his plans for the area.
JULIE	if my client can spin straw into gold, he'll still pay market price for straw. As a matter of fact--

JULIE	No. You have served us a 1981 or 1982. California Beaujolais.

YAKITITO	This is unbelievable! You been saying tonight for weeks and still you don't ask her! Maybe I ask to marry you.

JULIE	Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then:
JULIE	Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back.
JULIE	.They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she

CERTAIN PAYMENTS--	Strack has gotten up to pace.
STRACK	Yes yes, I know the memo. Julie continues, hesitantly:
JULIE	...It seems like the payments... were-
STRACK	They were pay-offs. To the zoning commission. Bribes, to call a spade a spade. He gives her an appraising look.
STRACK	.Does that shock you? No. In fact I'd surmised as much.
STRACK	But it disappoints you.
JULIE	
STRACK	That's right, it's not your place. Yet I value your good opinion.
JULIE	Surely you don't expect me to endorse it.
STRACK	Course not. I'm sure my father never intended for you to know about it. I'm sorry if He's compromised you in any way. But I am asking you to understand. I'm not going to bore you with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond. But you know as well as I that
STRACK (CONT'D)	not so much as one mini-mall ever went up in this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown. You're not naive; you know it's a cost of doing business. Ordinarily you don't have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and I'm tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development.
STRACK	Take a look at that model, Julie. That was my father's dream. Now it's my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well... .the point is my father is well beyond the reach of the law, but that memo could embarrass Strack enterprises.
JULIE	All right, you're point is well taken. But the fact remains that I'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of your buildings.
STRACK	Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for a few minutes, go to the ladies' room, leaving your briefcase here. What happens to the memorandum while it's in my custody is my responsibility. CONTINUED
67 CONTINUED(3)	Julie smiles.
JULIE	I wish it were that simple. First of all, I don't have the memo with me. Even if I did--
STRACK	It isn't safe to have that document.
JULIE	Are you threatening me?
STRACK	moves closer, touching her arm.
STRACK	I'm trying to protect you. Does. his lips, wondering if he can tru Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to you?
JULIE	He's an underworld figure-- racketeering, drugs. And real-estate. Robert Durant is competitor for the river-front and knows about that document. He is a criminal, Julie. And he will freelyat resort to criminal methods to get he wants. There's a pause.
AND	Well, you're very eloquent, frankly I'm not certain what I should do. You'll have to trust me for a day or so to figure this out.

RESIDENT	Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon. And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain-- giving him the strength of dozen men. Hence the leather restraints. The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns But as it rotates into frame and clangs to a halt.

JULIE	Peyton... It's okay...
ATTENDANT	Get lost, buddy. People screaming on the Tilt-A-Whirl. Merry-Go-Round horses bobbing up and down. Calliope music gets louder and louder. Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath:

PEYTON	Forgive me! He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped, forgotten, beneath one arm. 357 Julie runs after him.
JULIE	Peyton!

362 DARKMAN'S EYES 362	roll toward the noise. He steps back into the shadows. padding, and wigs. The place looks like the wardrobe room of a major studio.
JULIE	Peyton?! 364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364 upon something that makes her gasp. ripped to shreds, it's white stuffing all over the place. 366 He moves forward towards a darkened corner of 366 the lab. Peyton?! I need to talk to you. She halts at a site in front of her.

Accomparaed by the sound of BUZZING FLIES and SIZZLING Skin blisters boil furiously. She drops it There are tears in her eyes. Trembling, she turns to Presses bimself into the shadows.
JULIE	Peyton. .? turns his head sharply. Only the upper right corner of his face falls into the light. The handsome, undamaged portion.
JULIE	Why didn't you tell me? If you loved me, why didn't you tell me? shamed, to be both coward and monster, clutches his bony hand to his skull.
JULIE	You had no right-- 377 Tears stream down Julie's face but she is too upset
JULIE	coward! 378 She angrily shoves the computer off the table. It crashes to the ground, sparking.
JULIE	Do you think it was the face I cared about?! Is that how little you think of me?! Why didn't you come to me? He is shaken by a silent sob. More of his face falls hideous bone. 380 Julie looks about the dark and desolate warehouse. charred Peyton/Julie photograph. Her face softens. She feels the Darkman's pain.
JULIE	I would have helped you. She stares into the shadows a long time without speaking.
JULIE	Don't you know I love you, Peyton? And no matter what--no matter what you've become I'll always love you?
381 CLOSE ON DARKMAN	his eyes expressing a ray of hope he didn't think possible until now. O.S. We hear the sound of
DAR KHAN	Julie... Julie. 382 But Juba is gone.
Strackâ naked except for a monogrammed bath towel	the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment. A Mahler symphony plays in the background. He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the strain of the load, he staggers back across the room to the king-sized bed. With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands. They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over the sides and clatter to the floor. Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty, then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the floor. Like a swan he dives. He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips. Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then slough off, leaving their imprint. Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving himself with the golden coins-- A knock at the door. Strack freezes.
STRACK	Huhh??:!
VOICE	Julie Hasting's to see you, Mr. Strack.
383 CONTINU	Strack43 eyes dart nervously to the door. lb... Very well... He stands. A coin or two falls from his dimpled ass as he reaches down for his pants.
STRACK	Julie, how sweet of you to come before our appointed hour... but I expected-- you in something a little more formal. Didn't Ruth inform you that we have tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?
JULIE	I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.
STRACK	Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?
JULIE	Thank you, no.
STRACK	I'll have one;_ As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink.
STRACK	...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and it's quite good--
JULIE	Louis, I can't see you anymore.
STRACK	Darling, settle down. Don't be rash. As you say, let's talk.
JULIE	You know about Peyton, the man I was
JULIE	Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was burned, horribly, horribly burned--I don't understand what happened but I know he needs my help. Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy down.
STRACK	.Your news has a bittersweet flavor... Of course I'm very happy for you. If there's anything I can do-- the finest medical care can be at your disposal--burn therapy, recon- structive surgery. How badly was he... mutilated? Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's sofa, her body wracked with sobs.
STRACK	... Where is he, Julie?
JULIE	He's living in an abandoned warehouse. He's alone... he needs me. The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks it up.
STRACK	Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll take it in the other room. He looks up at Julie.
STRACK	I won't be a moment. He walks into an adjoining room. He picks up the phone.
STRACK	Yes, Franz... And the closing price?...
JULIE	She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is.
HER POV	Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk.
JULIE	Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer.
STRACK (OS)	I feel sufficiently diversified... Franz, it is immaterial to me what the market is doing. I want you to buy...
JULIE'S POV	A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the briefcase.
CLOSE ON THE PAPERS	A dark coffee stain.
BACK TO JULIE	As she pulls the papers from the briefcase. Yes, you did hear me correctly. I want you to buy. Ten thousand Krugerands. Fresh ones!
STRACK'S VOICE	Yes. The Belasarious memorandum.
JULIE	whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her
STRACK	.I'm sorry you had to find that, dear. Our relationship didn't need this further strain.
JULIE	The fire... it wasn't an accident, it was you.
STRACK	Not me personally. I have an employee who does certain things for me, unofficially, off the books. Robert doesn't like to pay taxes. And now you'll kill me. Strack_ spreads his arms.
STRACK	Hardly. You have nothing on me, my dear, and you'd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic. Julie. Consider the big picture.
STRACK	I suppose this is goodbye then. Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries out the door. 388 Strack moves quickly to the briefcase. He taps his fingers idly on the coffee-stained document. Then he hits a button on his desk-top intercom.
STRACK	Send Robert in. Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at
ROBERT G. DURANT	enters the room.
I STRACK	Robert! I have good news and bad.
DURANT	Custom dictates that you render the bad news first.
STRACK	You recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it. We have a similar situation with Miss Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us.
DURANT	No problem at all. And the good news?
STRACK	Your wife died. I'm joking, of course. No, the good news is that I know who's behind our little troubles of late. When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good doctor.
DURANT	Westlake? He's dead. I saw to it myself.
STRACK	He's alive. I don't like loose ends, Robert. Finish it.
DURANT	Okay. Where is he? Strack smiles.
STRACK	I believe we have a guide.
TRACKING WITH JULIE	as she crosses the street. The street is silent, desolate... Suddenly from out of nowhere, races toward her, about to run her over-- SCREECHES to a stop, only inches from her.
JULIE	turns to run.
ANOTHER LINCOLN CONTINENTAL	SCREECHES to a halt behind her, sandwiching her in.

A DOOR	is kicked open as Smiley and Guzman enter, guns ps blazing, shooting the lab to hell. The gunfire sto and the lab is quiet. Guzman speaks quietly into a walkee-talkee.
GUZMAN	we're in.
DURANT' S ., VOICE	He just went down from the roof.
GUZMAN	Glances above to the darkened rafters ofathence one to warehouse. Then, signals for Smiley way. He will go another. They split up. The place is eerily still; we hear only an occasional computer beep.
GUZMAN	...Holy San Juan de fuckeen Capistrano!

DURANT	Guzman, come in! Smiley! Guzman! What the fuck is going on down there?! A burst of STATIC. Then:
DARKMAN' S VOICE	I am. Durant drops the walkee-talkee as if it were something hot. Take her down!
CONTINUED	The pilot lowers the throttle stick and 412A the chopper swoops down. as the helicopter descends on the roof of the warehouse.
DURANT	I want that son of a bitch eliminated! And I don't want his fingers, I want his fucking head!
SKIP AND CORKY	run out onto the roof, assault rifles in hand. They advance slowly across the room... not a sound in the darkness except their footsteps and the occasional beep of a computer... the air is tense with danger. Skip and Corky whirl around as iron shutters slam down over the windows and doors, sealing the lab into an
OPEN GAS VALVES	HISS, filling the room with the explosive mix of oxygen and acetylene. You're next.
DURANT	Where are you?! Pilot.and Durant look toward the entrance of the warehouse. The door is closed. Suddenly...
TO	WHOMPI--a bandaged hand slams into Durant's chest grab bim and start hauling him towards the door. The Darkman is dragging him out towards the roof. Durant mashes the Darkman's arm with the door: 416 The helicopter starts rising.
DARKMAN	is yanked from his feet.
THE HELICOPTER	climbs, lifting the Darkman clear of the rooftop. it bobs up. and down. The same toy that destroyed Peyton's lab. Durant's lighter lies on a platform just under the beak of the drinking bird. It bobs closer and closer to the switch on the lighter, about to make contact.

Closer... closer... gropes desperately at the floor of the helicopter for a handhold. His fingertips barely touch a rope ladder.

THE DEAN	is hurled through the window of an office on the 70th floor of a skyscraper.
A BOARD MEETING	The executives stare in shock at the Darkman standing on their table.
DARKMAN'S POV	The faces of the executives whirling in a circle like numbers on a roulette wheel. 431 Suddenly, the faces start to recede... SMASH!... The remaining glass. pedestrians scurry from the rain of falling glass. Camera swishes up to reveal... as it roars away from the skyscraper at an insane angle,

He is grazed by the car's hood. His body bounces off the windshield. is lifted straight into the path of a fast-moving truck. run 80 miles an hour along the roof of the truck. Darkman manages to loop the bottom rung of the rope ladder to a steel hook on the truck's cab. Looking forward over Durant's and pilot's shoulders. The:pa3at has the stick.

STRACK	We've consolidated the waterfront, Governor ...Yes, I'm aware there's been some unpleasantness but that's over now. Yes, I'm sure. You sound a little nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch a cop show. The door opens. A security officer appears.
SECURITY OFFICER	Robert Durant, sir. Send him in. Goodbye, Governor. Everything's taken care of. He hangs up. We hear the door open and close. Strack's
ROBERT DURANT	enters. He looks awful--face scorched and bruised, severe limp.
STRACK	You look like hell, Robert.
DURANT	The son of a bitch malfunctioned my helicopter.
STRACK	And Westlake?
DURANT	'f ie man's a cockroach. You think you ;tall him, and he pops up someplace , Ise. A beat.
STRACK	g expect he'll pop up here soon. if Westlake calls, kindly refer him to Strack Towers. Come, Robert, let us kill the girl.
P44	P446 stars all around us.
STRACK	I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd hate to see your kids deprived of a role-model.
DURANT	They do look up to me. The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.
STRACK	Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a young man my father made me work high steel. That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me...
P446 CONTIKUED	Strack gestures broadly with one arm.
STRACK	...It was just me and the Indians, no one else crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an hour. Sure I resented it, but now-- call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it sharpens your wits. Life on the edge. Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty feet down. High steel... He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.
STRACK	You don't have any kids, Robert.
DURANT	What are you talking about?
STRACK	Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?
DUR ANT	I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!
STRACK	Then I'm going to make a mistake. There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil. Where's the girl? Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles back over his shoulder.
STRACK	You want to see the girl? Follow me, I'll take you to her... Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative steps.
STRACK	...I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries. That's okay. I'm a good sport... He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind.
STRACK	...And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet... .as for my father, well, he was old, I spared him a few miserable years... Yes, we all have dreams, Dr. Westlake, but we don't all have what it takes to realize those dreams.
DURANT/DARKMAN	All I have are nightmares. A beat.
STRACK	Then share my dream. After all, you and I are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like you. Go to hell.
STRACK	Eventually, eventually... He proceeds nimbly along the beam.
STRACK	I guess you just don't have what it takes. I gather you run around wearing other people's faces now, since yours is so... loathsome. He shrugs.
STRACK	.See I could never do that. The world has to take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you've been up to. Silly. Living in the past. ; only destroy to build something better, whereas You..â¢ ah, here we are. whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically to an upright.
DURANT/DARKMAN	Julie! Strack laughs.
STRACK	Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!! 448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat--
449 JULIE	gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time, overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses like csa y.. Strack"s tone is almost admiring:
STR.ACK	You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.
BLAM!	Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing with rage.
THE WORLD	Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss--
GIRDER	As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing.
ON THE UPPER GIRDER	Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV-- Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.
JULIE	recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her hair. First my wife, then my father, and now He places his hands on her shoulders, preparing to push -It is the tragedy of my life that I always have to kill the ones I love. As he's about to push her:
A VOICE BEHIND HIM	IDuis ! Strack turns around. 4 5 0 STRACK St. stands behind him, glaring angrily.
STRACK JR.	Father? I should've snuffed you out at birth! With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for his gun. Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his

BAM! BAM! BAM!	Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto crawls toward them. 451 CONTI1rn D 451
A RIVET GUN	only a few inches from his grasp.
DARIOM	swoops onto Strack, pummelling him.
STRACR'S HAND	inching painfully toward the rivet gun.
DARKMAN	pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He steps back to give a final blow... .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.
STRACK	lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar. 452 The rivet gun shoots a bolt through Darkman's wrist, then the other wrist--pinning him to the I-beam... Strack takes a step backward, exhausted.
STRACK	Now you get to watch your girl-friend die. He moves toward a terrified Julie.
DARXMAN	SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the
454 CRACK!	Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin into Darkman's eyeball to find-- Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the 456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456 lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a shower of gold Krugerands. 457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457 Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears a funny little hat. 458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458 459 A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice.

462 STRACK 462	with his back to him, doesn't have a chance to turn as:
DARKMAN	pounces. He lifts him full into the air. Strack's legs and arms Darkman hurls him up, up into the air. 463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463 464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464 her.
JULIE	Peyton, I can help.
DARKMAN	No one can help.
JULIE	I don't care how you look, Peyton! I. love you. The burns don't matter. There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.
DARKMAN	Take my hand. Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She
DARKMAN	It disgusts you.
JULIE	No. Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.
DARKMAN	This hand... it used to caress you. Now it can only tear, rip away at things. But you'll perfect the skin. You'll get rid of the scars.
DARKMAN	It's not just the scars. I've changed- He grips his skull.
DARKMAN	--inside. He pulls the elevator open. I can live with it now, but I don't think anyone else can.
JULIE	I want it back. The two of us--the way it was... Darkman's voice breaks: What we had--our life together--it belonged in the light of day. He disappears into the darkness.
JULIE	Peyton! Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:
DARKMAN	Peyton is gone... 466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466 side. Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic. The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she staring at their faces... It begins to snow.
JULIE	Peyton! She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into
AS WE ROLL END CREDITS	The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians, any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,
467 A MUSCULAR HAND 467	snaps open a switch-blade. A second set of arms grabs the street person and spins him around, revealing--
THE CHARRED SKULL OF DARKMAN	Wild, half-mad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets.
