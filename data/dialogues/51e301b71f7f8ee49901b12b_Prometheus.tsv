CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
WATTS	Moving to survey site B... closing on object four. The large oblong. front of her. Something big.
WATTS (CONT'D)	There you are. brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away loose silt and stones.
WATTS	Martin. Here. A second excavator glides out of the dark. rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
HOLLOWAY	Look at that. obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.
WATTS	You need to see this.
HOLLOWAY (V.O.)	Coming.
WATTS	Same thing again.
HOLLOWAY	What do you see?
WATTS	An ephemeris - a star map. Radius, inclination, azimuth...more data here...
HOLLOWAY	If we can get epoch and equinox out of that...
WATTS	Can we raise this thing?
HOLLOWAY	Hundreds of tons. work. But they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand.
HOLLOWAY	I have a solution. A single match.
WATTS	Me too. Checked it twice.
HOLLOWAY	You first.
WATTS	What do we do now?
HOLLOWAY	We go there.
WATTS	What's first? You do climate, I do genetics?
HOLLOWAY	Archaeology first. Let our ancestors tell the tale.
WATTS	You think he's serious?
HOLLOWAY	Serious enough to send his private shuttle.
WATTS	Weyland can send his shuttle out for pizza.
WATTS (CONT'D)	Martin. If this meeting goes like the others, maybe we should...
HOLLOWAY	It won't go like the others.
WATTS	How do you know?
HOLLOWAY	Heaven smiles on our enterprise. DAVID, an android, stands waiting for them. He's cunningly
DAVID	Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name is DAVID.
WATTS	Hello, DAVID.
DAVID	Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you.
DAVID	These are all the planetary bodies on which Weyland Industries has mining claims.
DAVID (CONT'D)	And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.
HOLLOWAY	How is that going? The terraforming.
WATTS	They say you're getting diminishing returns. It's not working.
DAVID	It's the greatest engineering project ever attempted. Challenges are inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a determined man. Buffet type: a country sage, horse-sense and hard knocks. He might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy.
WEYLAND	Professor Holloway. Ms. Watts.
WATTS	Doctor Watts.
WEYLAND	Forgive me. Peter Weyland.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	Ah. DAVID here's a prototype. Our 80 series. One of a kind for now, but if he performs, he will be legion. What do you want here?
HOLLOWAY	We sent you a prospectus that...
WEYLAND	Assume I know nothing.
HOLLOWAY	I'm an archaeologist.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	In my studies I discovered a pattern I couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred years, sudden advances in agriculture, tool use, technology. Inventions. Something caused a great leap forward. Every eleven centuries. The pattern holds as far back as our data goes. Tens of thousands of years. I had to understand this. It became the focus of my work.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	Dr. Watts was a student of mine. Watts in the laboratory.
WATTS	I was analyzing historical changes in human DNA. I found the same pattern. Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new information in the genome of the human race. All over the world. Evolution can't do that. Something was changing us. Changing the DNA of our species.
HOLLOWAY	Humanity's been visited. Visited by...beings from somewhere else.
VICKERS	You mean aliens.
WEYLAND	Lydia Vickers, Director of Operations. Practically my right hand.
HOLLOWAY	They guided us to civilization. Lifted us up, again and again. I call them the Engineers.
WATTS	Once you know what you're looking for, it's amazing how the evidence falls into place.
HOLLOWAY	This is the writing of the Engineers. We've found it on every continent. And last year, we found our Rosetta Stone.
WATTS	The writing is a formula giving the location of a single star in our sky.
WEYLAND	Which star?
HOLLOWAY	We're keeping that confidential for now. But that's where we want to go.
WEYLAND	You want me to pay for an interstellar research expedition!
HOLLOWAY	It's a chance to be part of a revolution in scientific...
WEYLAND	Don't sell me, professor. You've been turned down by every university and government agency under the sun. Nobody's going to gamble that kind of money on your hunch.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	Nobody but me. I've read your research.
HOLLOWAY	That's impossible. Our research is-
WEYLAND	Quantum encoded on secure servers, yeah. We have an A.I. division, you should know. Doing impressive things. I know which star you're wishing on.
WATTS	You're bluffing.
WEYLAND	Zeta Two Reticuli.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	You know how I got this rich? I ask myself: what does God spend his time doing? And I go and do that.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	Biotechnology was good to me. Fusion power. Lately doing well with gravity systems.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	But what's the first thing God did?
WATTS	He made the Heaven and the Earth.
WEYLAND	That's what I'm talking about. You left out my favorite part. The piece about Earth. DAVID.
DAVID	For eons, Earth's climate swung from hothouse to ice age. Explosions of life, then mass extinctions. But twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a period of anomalous tranquility. The rise of civilization began only then.
HOLLOWAY	That's right.
WATTS	And that change coincides with a visit by the Engineers. They didn't just change us. They changed our world.
WEYLAND	That's the piece I mean. Engineering Earth. God stuff.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	My people checked your science. They say it's solid.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	I'll give you your expedition. Ship and crew, supplies, support. One condition.
HOLLOWAY	What's that?
WEYLAND	You get the discovery. Control of the site. But any technology you find? Anything at all. That's mine.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)	You take DAVID with you. My eyes and ears. And Vickers...you're going too. The name painted on its hull is MAGELLAN.
DOWNS	Look at that.
KAMAROV	She wakes up slow.
HOLLOWAY (O.S.)	Get out of there!
STILLWELL	Just looking.
HOLLOWAY	Give us a moment, will you?
WATTS	I'm out of sorts. Sorry.
HOLLOWAY	Never worry.
WATTS	My head's buzzing.
HOLLOWAY	You just slept two and a half years. It'll pass.
WATTS	Like you've done this before.
HOLLOWAY	I've read all about it.
BRICK	Sleep okay?
WATTS	Yes, thanks...
GLASSE	Captain'll see you now. captain of a whaling ship.
JANEK	Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed already. A hundred years ago.
WATTS	By an unmanned probe. Very crude.
JANEK	No Earthlike planets.
WATTS	No.
JANEK	So what are you looking for?
HOLLOWAY	Proof of the Engineers' existence.
WATTS	Confirmation of Professor Holloway's theories would change everything. There'd be science before Holloway and science after.
JANEK	Your ticket. I'll put the ship where you want. Run your scans.
HOLLOWAY	Captain, your crew's been up for a week. We could've used the time. Why'd you wait to wake us?
JANEK	Better for discipline. Men ship out as prospectors for one reason: the percentage. Find a gold mine or a habitable planet, and you're set for life. But this contract says no percentage. No bounty. Just triple pay. The men aren't happy.
HOLLOWAY	You unhappy too?
JANEK	I'm always unhappy. documents slide under their fingertips: an Engineer alphabet.
WATTS	DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.
DAVID	I trust your database is in order. I set it up myself.
WATTS	All's well, I think.
DAVID	I should tell you: the time you spent sleeping, I spent studying your research.
WATTS	You studied our work for two and a half years.
DAVID	It's quite a data set.
HOLLOWAY	So you've seen everything. Well. What do you think? Your hypothesis is...bold. The audacity of it. Your climate data's undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. Pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. I believe in your "Engineers."
They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate	
HOLLOWAY	Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms. Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	About the materials I gave you. Some of the technical aspects...
CHANCE	We'll handle our end of the job. If there is a job.
CHANCE	We only have a job if you find something. CORRIDOR desk, a dining table.
WATTS	Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's only ten of those things on Earth! I guess nine, now.
VICKERS	I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't compromise my standard of living. He accommodated me.
HOLLOWAY	I know, I had to cut my manifest. This used to be the number four cargo bay.
VICKERS	What can I do for you, Professor?
HOLLOWAY	We're about to reach the system periphery. I thought you'd want to see the search protocols we -
VICKERS	No. I was set to be the next CEO of Weyland Industries. Then you came along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this. So here I am. Out of the running. I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask me to play along.
WATTS	But when you get back...
VICKERS	I'll be five years behind the curve. Out of touch. Over.
HOLLOWAY	You might make the discovery of the ages.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	You don't believe in what we're doing.
VICKERS	Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough.
VICKERS (CONT'D)	Now we're out of communication, you can tell the crew what we're doing.
WATTS	They don't know? They volunteered.
VICKERS	They volunteered blind. Classified job, triple pay.
DOWNS	Aliens.
GLASSE	You shitting me?
HOLLOWAY	I think all our mythologies are race- memories of the Engineers. Horus the Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of smoke. The Engineers are the gods. Kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy.
KAMAROV	The mythology gods maybe. God is God.
STILLWELL	Kamarov. Let him talk.
STILLWELL (CONT'D)	So we're going to meet these things?
WATTS	We probably won't meet anyone. You'd expect a star-traveling race to generate radio or laser signals. Fusion drives and gravity drives have clear signatures. But Zeta Two Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers have gone missing on Earth.
WATTS (CONT'D)	By the pattern, they should've come to Earth seventeen centuries ago. And again six centuries ago. But no sign. After twelve thousand years...they stopped coming.
BRICK	Why?
HOLLOWAY	Exactly. Why?
JANEK	"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
JANEK (CONT'D)	Is that the question you've come light- years to answer?
HOLLOWAY	Only my first question. I have many. distant star like Earth's Sun, surrounded by orbiting planets: mere sparks at this distance.
JANEK	Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli. Edge of the system. Open her eyes.
JANEK	Overlay. trace the ellipses of their orbits.
DOWNS	Seven planets. Two hot rocks, two gas giants, three snowballs. Nothing Earthlike.
WATTS	First humans in the system.
JANEK	Director. Good of you to join us.
VICKERS	What did I miss?
CAPTAIN JANEK	Just getting warmed up. Professor? You know what you want?
HOLLOWAY	EMR scan, thirty hertz to three hundred gigahertz. Spectroscopic passes on every planet and major moon. Infrared and albedo scan for hot spots and light sources.
CAPTAIN JANEK	Man knows what he wants. Run it.
GLASSE	Negative on radio chatter system-wide. Nobody's talking.
BRICK	Negative for laser and maser.
GLASSE	No biological markers. No artificial light. No industry or agriculture. Dead system. Like always.
DOWNS	Piss-poor, too. Low in heavy elements.
BRICK	Got a hit! A moon. LV-426.
BRICK (CONT'D)	Eighty-six percent Earth's mass. Atmosphere's nitrogen, methane, sulfates. Faint returns for a bunch of metals.
HOLLOWAY	Anything else?
JANEK	That is all.
HOLLOWAY	Take us in.
JANEK	Downs. You heard the man.
DOWNS	Aye, Captain. Maneuvering. Eighteen hours to orbit. Epsilon and its mysterious moon. PASSAGEWAY
HOLLOWAY	DAVID. Enjoy the show?
DAVID	I don't know that I "enjoy" things. It was informative.
HOLLOWAY	It was, it was. You know, I've seen more convincing humanoid robots.
DAVID	My design's not intended to convince. Simulating humanity is a complex task that diverts resources. My designers dispensed with that burden to optimize for intelligence.
WATTS	Why look like a man at all? Why not be a box on wheels?
DAVID	Being shaped like you, I can use spaces and equipment designed for you. But I'm not so limited. I hear frequencies you can't hear. I see wavelengths of light invisible to you. I move faster. Exert greater force.
WATTS	You see yourself as a superman.
DAVID	No.
DAVID (CONT'D)	Not a man at all.
WATTS	What if they're really there? The Engineers. They could be there. Waiting for us. What then?
HOLLOWAY	Then all my dreams come true. and antennae sprout once more from its hull.
HOLLOWAY	Start with passive systems. We're uninvited guests. Let's be quiet.
BRICK	A lot of electromag, all random. That's lightning. Going to bugger up our scans.
HOLLOWAY	Go active. Mapping radar.
The display paints data on the moonscape as the wavefront	
JANEK	Well, we just rang the doorbell, if anybody's listening.
HOLLOWAY	What do we see?
BRICK	Icecaps at the poles. Frozen methane. Cold down there.
GLASSE	Terrain data rezzing up. Hey! We got hard spots. Radar-opaque. Bright reflections. That's metal.
HOLLOWAY	That's not natural.
MILBURN	You see stuff like that sometimes. Mineral deposits. Volcanic ejecta.
GLASSE	Big one there.
HOLLOWAY	Still quiet?
BRICK	No comm signals. No signs of life.
HOLLOWAY	I want to get below the clouds. reaches out. Squeezes Holloway's hand.
GLASSE	Coming up on site seven.
DOWNS	Nothing.
HOLLOWAY	Look there.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	Are we recording?
WATTS	Tungsten, tantalum, aluminum. That could be technology.
HOLLOWAY	Let's see the next one. first, sits on the brink of a vast canyon. Landslides have eaten at its edges.
WATTS	Identical, apart from weathering.
MILBURN	Could be a rock formation. Carbon crystallizes like that.
HOLLOWAY	Let's see the big one.
BRICK	Closing on the major site... trenches. Like a pattern of crop-circles sunk in the rock.
BRICK (CONT'D)	No radio. No heat sources. Cold as the grave.
HOLLOWAY	Nobody home.
WATTS	I don't think anybody's been home for a long time.
HOLLOWAY	All right. Let's move.
JANEK	There's only six hours of daylight left. Maybe you should hold off.
WATTS	We've got that outside the windows and you want to wait `til tomorrow?
WATTS	The air here will kill you, so keep an eye on your supply and watch your seals. Pathogen tests are clean.
HOLLOWAY	Move slowly. Stay together. Don't touch anything. Things may be more fragile than they look - or more dangerous. There might be technologies operating here we don't understand. uncertain what to think. monument on a triumphal avenue.
They pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone	eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain.
HOLLOWAY	Tell me that's a natural formation. Undeniable proof of alien civilization. You were here on this day, thirty-one December, year of our Lord 2172. History will remember your names. aperture leads into the pyramid.
WATTS	The door's open.

DAVID	Congratulations, Professor Holloway. expand as they explore. again: a DEMONIC VOICE speaking some unearthly language.
WATTS	Martin. Martin! the creature passing through him. fallen back down the passageway.
FIFIELD	Christ. Christ!
RAVEL	It wasn't real.
MILBURN	We all saw it. their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly
HOLLOWAY	Recording?
FIFIELD	No more. I'm out.
HOLLOWAY	Fifield. Get a grip.
FIFIELD	I'm a prospector. You find a load of bauxite, I'm your man. But not this.
MILBURN	I should go with him. Buddy system.
HOLLOWAY	Fine.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	You can deploy the drones. Drop them in the first or second nexus on your way back.
FIFIELD	Give us a rover.
HOLLOWAY	And half our gear? It's no more than a mile. You can walk it. Holloway glances at his map.
HOLLOWAY	pyramid.
WATTS	Jack it open? Or cut through?
HOLLOWAY	Let's do as little damage as we can.
RAVEL	There's power. Current flowing in the wall.
CHANCE	Maybe we can hack it. Has to be a mechanism... DAVID looks as if they fail to see something obvious. He
DAVID	Pull up a rover. I want to get up there.

JANEK	Director. Taking an interest?
VICKERS	It's my operation, isn't it?
FIFIELD	What do you think?
MILBURN	Grand Central Station.
FIFIELD	Let's check the feed. Gimme the map.
MILBURN	You had the map unit.
FIFIELD	You don't have the map?
MILBURN	Are you serious?
MILBURN (CONT'D)	Come on.
DAVID	Looks like a three-state switch.
DAVID (CONT'D)	One moment... somewhere near the peak.
RAVEL	This is something, now.
DAVID	Yes. Yes, it is. The android's awareness is keyed to a high pitch. He seems to
WATTS	Martin. This air's breathable.
The core chamber brightens as the sun outside moves into	
HOLLOWAY	Miracles and wonders!
The explorers follow the main path around the periphery of	
WATTS	Intense field readings. Huge power sources here.
HOLLOWAY	Space below us. A big space.
WATTS	How does this work? him, and walks away.
HOLLOWAY	Ravel. Chance. Where've you gone? DAVID! Where are you? They didn't come down!
WATTS	Look. implies by its design that a giant is meant to fit inside it.
WATTS	Do you see, the size of them? Like that ghost we saw...
HOLLOWAY	It wasn't a ghost. Where are the others? I don't want to go back up.
WATTS	They switched to channel three. I hear them talking. They're okay.
HOLLOWAY	We should stay together.
MILBURN	This is not the same place.
FIFIELD	It is! That is the same freaky thing we saw before.
MILBURN	No it's not! The other one was more... sort of...fuck it. Milburn to Magellan. Come in.
KAMAROV	God in Heaven.
WATTS	Martin. Martin.
HOLLOWAY	I know. Look. escape. All bear horrific wounds.
HOLLOWAY	"There were giants in the earth in those days...and when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, they bare children to them, who became mighty men." Genesis six four.
DOWNS	You said don't touch anything! You said don't touch anything!
HOLLOWAY	Peace.
CHANCE	The size of them!
HOLLOWAY	In all the old mythologies, the visitors from the sky were giants. traces the ancient, terrible wounds.
WATTS	They were killed. All of them.
DOWNS	We shouldn't be here.
HOLLOWAY	Come on. The dead can't hurt you. DAVID. Chance. Ravel. I've got something here.
WATTS	Communications are going to hell. between the night side and day side.
JANEK	All hands. Back to the ship. We got a mean storm front rolling in. I repeat. All hands...
JANEK (V.O.)	front rolling...back to the ship.
HOLLOWAY	We've found something here! I'm not walking away for bad weather.
JANEK	Holloway! I got two-hundred-kilometer winds with airborne silica and enough static to fry your suits. Get your asses back here! Now! miserably beside her. Watts looks back: toward zero.
WATTS	Help me unload! She pulls at the tarp. It tears halfway free - and fills with out into the storm.
HOLLOWAY	Jocelyn!
The crewmen bundle the rover's tarp-wrapped cargo into a	nod and vanishes into the ship. The explorers exchange looks. A mood of exuberance and wonder
HOLLOWAY	Day one.
DOWNS	Got to hand it to you, professor. You were right. Both of you.
CHANCE	What's in the tarp? What'd you bring back?
WATTS	You don't want to know.
STILLWELL	Shit. We're two helmets short.
KAMAROV	They didn't come in!
JANEK	Between the wind speeds and the static electricity, there's no safe way to get to you. You're going to have to hunker down until it passes. How are your provisions? We got air . Water and food tabs suits.
JANEK	Honey sacks?
FIFIELD	Yeah, we're piped.
MILBURN	I hate these fucking things.
FIFIELD (V.O.)	We hate these fucking , Captain.
JANEK	Maybe next time you'll mind your maps. Keep your heads down. We'll come get you in the morning.
JANEK (CONT'D)	Magellan out.
HOLLOWAY	My friends. What we do here marks the greatest achievement of our species. Contact with another civilization. Humanity came of age today, on this moon. You were there. To history.
JANEK	To Milburn and Fifield. The first human beings to freak out, get lost, and sleep in their suits in the ruins of an alien civilization.
MILBURN	What are you looking for?
FIFIELD	Someplace things can't come at us.
MILBURN	What's gonna come at us?
DAVID	The core of the pyramid. You see.
VICKERS	We're going to protocol two.
DAVID	I understand. LABORATORY Holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter:
WATTS	Martin. Look.
WATTS (CONT'D)	They look like us.
HOLLOWAY	We look like them. Genesis 1:27. "And God created man in his own image. In his own image created He him."
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	It's breaking down.
WATTS	Formaldehyde! five-gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet.
DAVID	Mortal after all. smocks, scrubbing their hands.
VICKERS	Your cadaver's interesting. But I'm more interested in the machinery in the pyramid. The core chamber. What do you think it does?
WATTS	How could anyone know...
HOLLOWAY	I know what it does.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	Think. What we've seen. What we know.
WATTS	Twenty-four pyramids scattered around the moon's equator. Massive power supplies. Vents in the walls. Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks... The pyramids are terraforming machines.
HOLLOWAY	That's why Earth's ancient cultures built pyramids: in imitation of the gods. Twelve thousand years ago, beings from the sky set pyramids on the Earth and transformed the world. That's what they were doing here - before their civilization failed.
WATTS	It didn't fail. It was wiped out.
MILBURN	Look at this!
FIFIELD	Jesus! Put it down!
MILBURN	Relax. Your suit's bug-proof. Hell, it's bulletproof. suddenly gapes wide as a shark's.
MILBURN (CONT'D)	That's enough. Get it off! It's crushing me!
MILBURN (CONT'D)	AHH! Help me! Christ! iridescent like opal. A jewel.
HOLLOWAY	You won't get anything. Tissue's too degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's massive, even proportionately.
WATTS	Neural paths are still conductive.
GLASSE	Incredible.
WATTS	Formaldehyde's killing the tissue.
HOLLOWAY	Did you record that?
WATTS	Of course. avidly, an unabashed fan.
WATTS (CONT'D)	The lens is where the phase shift happens.
WATTS (CONT'D)	Glasse. I want to look through these lenses. Can you seal them and do the optical correction?
GLASSE	Got an idea about that. suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole.
MILBURN	Cut off my arm. Cut off my -
FIFIELD	Jesus Christ!
FIFIELD	Fifield to Magellan. Come on, come on. Anybody, seriously! God damn it!
FIFIELD (CONT'D)	Get off! Shit. DNA, transforming...
WATTS	We found the gods. And they've been murdered.
HOLLOWAY	You've pried too many arrowheads out of old skulls to get squeamish now. They've been dead what, eighteen hundred years? Two thousand?
WATTS	What could kill them?
HOLLOWAY	Who knows?
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	But I guess we know why they never came back to us. Something killed them off - back around the time of Christ. Maybe He was one of them! A great teacher, sent from Heaven? Jesus. The last Engineer.
WATTS	Martin, stop!
JANEK	You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me...
DAVID	Activate. Administrative override. highest paycheck to this strange duty.
VICKERS	Captain Shepherd.
SHEPHERD	Reporting.
SHEPHERD (CONT'D)	Understood.
VICKERS	I'll brief you on the way. We need to move.
SHEPHERD	No breakfast?
WATTS	What is that?
HOLLOWAY	Where is everybody? We can't - Who are you?
VIGODA	Captain Janek took his crew out to retrieve his missing men. They never came in.
HOLLOWAY	And you are...
VIGODA	Vigoda. Weyland Security detail.
WATTS	Where'd you come from?
VIGODA	Director's call to brief you on that. I'm supposed to escort you to the worksite.
HOLLOWAY	Worksite?
VIGODA	Haven't been out yet. I understand it's in some kind of pyramid. standing guard at the door.
HOLLOWAY	Why wasn't I told about these additional personnel?
VICKERS	They're my personnel. On my ship.
WATTS	What are the guns for?
VICKERS	I'm being careful. These new finds give our work a new importance.
WATTS	You should have talked to us. Martin's mission leader. That's in our contract.
VICKERS	The second you found alien technology, control of this mission reverted to me. That's in your contract too.
VICKERS (CONT'D)	Mr. Weyland's pouring trillions into Mars. He's spent a fortune building ships like the Magellan to search for colony planets. But Earthlike worlds are vanishingly rare. The right distance from the sun, the right atmosphere, enough water...
VICKERS (CONT'D)	This is a technology to transform worlds. He'll never give it up. And neither will I.
HOLLOWAY	The science must come first. You can wait until we've documented...
VICKERS	You're standing on an alien world courtesy of Weyland Industries. Be grateful.
WATTS	What are they doing in there?! darkness overhead. Brick. Janek studies an electronic map as he drives.
GLASSE	Milburn. Fifield. You read me? Come back.
JANEK	We should be getting beacons off their suits.
STILLWELL	Shielding in the walls?
BRICK	Suits could have failed.
JANEK	Both suits?
WATTS	We found the tomb of the gods, and brought grave-robbers right to the door.
HOLLOWAY	Let them scratch. This find's too big to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on this moon. Anyway, they're on the wrong track. That's infrastructure.
Holloway plays his flashlight over the biomechanical	
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	The core activity of the complex was down here. They are otherwise unmarked. sitting positions, others standing. Their design is invasive:
WATTS	Something different killed these. Disappears in a puff of static.
WATTS	Martin? Martin! illuminate a hideous sight:
STILLWELL	What happened to him? back with a cry. Captain.
JANEK	Where's the rest of him?
DOWNS	No sign.
JANEK	All right. We're done here. All hands back aboard.
STILLWELL	What about Milburn?
JANEK	We can't bring the body aboard. God knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll put him in an ore hopper. plastic in the bed of a cargo rover.
JANEK (V.O.)	Repeat, I have two men down. I'm pulling my crew back to the ship. I'd advise you to do the...
WATTS (V.O.)	Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's missing.
JANEK (V.O.)	Watts. Where are you?
VICKERS	Captain Shepherd. Consider yourself responsible for my personal security.
JANEK	I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm not sending any more men off into the dark.
WATTS	We can't leave Martin out there.
JANEK	Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers.
WATTS	She says "her forces are committed."
DAVID (O.S.)	I'll stay.
DAVID (CONT'D)	You'll be safe.
WATTS	Thank you.
JANEK	Put him in the number one ore hopper. Get the scrubbers on in the airlock. Sterilize everything.
DAVID	You and Holloway should work with me. I'm learning amazing things. This mechanism - the first layer uses energy fields to catalyze chemical reactions. The second can suspend the strong and weak forces - transmuting one element into another. The third layer builds customized bacteria. Seeds the air with them. It creates life as a tool, to change worlds.
WATTS	I can't think about this now!
DAVID	You should. I understand. You're emotional.
WATTS	I'm human.
DAVID	That's what I mean. Watts. We've got another storm front coming in. Looks like it follows the sunset line. If you're coming in you'd better do it now. No.
DAVID	I see light.
WATTS	Janek, hang on...
WATTS (CONT'D)	We've got him! Martin! Where's your helmet?
HOLLOWAY	Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented. I've just been...
DAVID	Here. I can do without this.
WATTS	Let's get you home.
JANEK	I didn't think I'd see you again. You know we lost two men.
HOLLOWAY	She told me. I'm sorry.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	I need to lie down. We'll size things up in the morning. Fair enough?
JANEK	Of course. claimed to feel.
WATTS	What happened to you?
HOLLOWAY	Not here.
HOLLOWAY	Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my mouth tastes like an old boot.
WATTS	What's this?
HOLLOWAY	Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on it.
WATTS	What did you see?
HOLLOWAY	After my fall, I woke up walking. Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I took it off. I was in and out. I just wandered. I went up into a huge space like a cathedral. And I found a model of the galaxy. Floating in the air.
WATTS	Are you okay? You sound...
HOLLOWAY	This was real. My headset video is wherever my helmet is...but my suit tracker will show where I was.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	Listen. This star map had a marker representing Earth. Very clear. Another marker I'm sure represents this moon. But there were others. At least seven or eight more.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)	The Engineers aren't from here. This moon's just an outpost. Abandoned. But if we follow that map, we may yet make contact with a living civilization.
WATTS	Martin.
HOLLOWAY	The location of the Engineer worlds is the real prize. Next to that, Weyland's terraforming is chump change. We need to get coordinates. And keep them from the Company. We have to play this smart.
WATTS	All right.
HOLLOWAY	Two men dead...Vickers is jumpy. As soon as she gets what she wants, she'll take this ship home. We have to move fast.
WATTS	We will. You all right?
HOLLOWAY	I'm fine, now. love.
WATTS	Your heart's beating so hard.
HOLLOWAY	That's your fault.
WATTS	Martin! Martin!
WATTS (CONT'D)	Martin! hideous lunging jaw.
WATTS	Martin. Martin! Janek and Stillwell struggle to take in what they're seeing. around Watts. Pulls her gently away from the bed. blood under the fabric.
JANEK	Take care of her. Get her a sedative. Downs. Get Holloway into a freezer. Everybody else with me. Glasse enters. Reacts in dismay. Tries to pull her back.
GLASSE	You don't want to see that...
WATTS	I want to understand.
The entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency	
JANEK	All right! Listen up. I expect you all know what...
JANEK (CONT'D)	We've got some kind of parasite aboard ship.
VICKERS	I suggest you kill it.
DOWNS	There's a bright idea.
KAMAROV	Show us where it is, lady. We just spent five hours looking for the damn thing.
WATTS	We found Engineers who died like Martin.
WATTS (CONT'D)	Explosive wounds in the chest. Whatever killed Martin is the same thing that killed the Engineers a thousand years ago.
STILLWELL	Jesus.
WATTS	But not all the Engineers died that way. The others were torn apart. Slashed to pieces.
JANEK	We're a modular ship. Self-contained life-support and power in every section. I say put the ship in orbit. Vent every compartment to space. Sit in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for a week. Kill anything.
DOWNS	Then what?
STILLWELL	Straight home, man.
VICKERS	This ship doesn't lift until our work's done.
JANEK	Are you serious?
VICKERS	We spent years and billions of dollars getting here. The technology we came for is in our hands. We just need a little more time.
JANEK	We're barely here three days and three men dead!
VICKERS	They were careless.
JANEK	Careless!
HOLLOWAY (V.O.)	Seven dead Engineers all facing the same way. Going where? Jocelyn's right, we don't see the big picture yet. Another level below me. I'm going down. SERVICE CORRIDOR
CARD	Vigoda, take Kamarov and work the number one accessway. I'll work number three with Downs and Stillwell.
DOWNS	You in charge now?
CARD	Tactical op.
KAMAROV	Yeah, well, Stillwell's the ventilation specialist, and life support's that way. Downs is electrics and the regulators are that way. comment and return to their work.
KAMAROV	You got the rifle. But you want ME to stick my head in the hole.
VIGODA	We grunts don't know nothing about ships, right?
KAMAROV	What's the damn gun for if you're gonna stand behind me the whole time?
VIGODA	I kill whatever kills you.
KAMAROV	Funny. You take this vent, funny guy. I'll be on four. through the vent with a flashlight. Nothing to see.
KAMAROV	I got more damage on four.
Horrific force collapses Kamarov's shoulder. Bones crack. The	through. By the time his ribs are in he stops screaming. Captain!
JANEK	Brick. What you got? It's Kamarov. Jocelyn! Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their vile orifices cinched tightly shut. Holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the a holographic ghost.
HOLLOWAY	Jocelyn! now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk.
JANEK	All hands, duty stations. Ready for flight. The Magellan is lifting.
VICKERS	Captain. Captain!
JANEK	What is it?
GLASSE	Nav computer's not responding. "Access denied."
JANEK	What have you done to my ship?
VICKERS	Nothing. What's wrong? A mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and waiting for some connection. The chair is empty. homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
WATTS	DAVID.
DAVID	Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you. Do you know what this is?
WATTS	How did you do that?
DAVID	Ah. You don't see. I call this ship the Juggernaut. Chariot of the Gods. This is the navigation computer, for want of a better term. But it's much more than that. It seems to hold the observable universe in its memory.
WATTS	Their homeworld. Do you see where the Engineers come from?
DAVID	There are safeguards on that data. It's toward the galactic center. Sagittarius Arm.
WATTS	DAVID. The creature that killed Martin. There are thousands of them under the pyramid. Hatcheries.
DAVID	I know.
WATTS	Those things wiped out the Engineers on this moon.
DAVID	I've succeeded in connecting with the Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I know a great deal today I didn't know yesterday. I'm on the verge of activating more systems. Archives.
WATTS	You're turning things on? This site should be sealed. Evacuated.
DAVID	Would Holloway have walked away from this? There's no greater work I can imagine.
WATTS	It's too dangerous.
DAVID	Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've read your file. Your intelligence scores are even higher than Professor Holloway's. But he had a kind of courage. An audacity of imagination. If you could find that in yourself...
WATTS	If your owner gives you a direct order, you have to obey. Don't you?
WATTS (CONT'D)	I can have Vickers pull you out.
DAVID	I was given two operating protocols for this mission. I was to render you every assistance - until you discovered what Vickers would call a "game-changing technology." I was given a specific list. Then I was to go to protocol two.
WATTS	What's protocol two?
DAVID	Under protocol two I was to make sure that you and Holloway never spoke to anyone about this place. Various acceptable ways of making sure of that. I was given a list.
DAVID (CONT'D)	You're all so stupid. VAULTED PASSAGE
DAVID	Stupid and slow. eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker.
WATTS	DAVID. What are you doing?
DAVID	Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna, was also a bringer of death. Crushing his worshippers under its wheels.
DAVID (CONT'D)	This ship has seven other cargo bays like this one. The eggs in each bay slightly different. They've been weaponized.
DAVID (CONT'D)	I've seen the Juggernaut's flight plan. Its destination was Earth. Seventeen hundred years ago. This was the ship that never came. This was its cargo.
WATTS	Stop!
DAVID	Perfect predators. Designed to kill human beings. That's what the Engineers were bringing to Earth. This was a death ship. clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored.
DAVID (CONT'D)	I'm not what it wants. But you, with your warm wet breath...it knows you.
WATTS	DAVID. No. No.
DAVID	The Engineers did their work too well. And on this waystation moon, the weapon they made destroyed them.
WATTS	Why would they make such things?
DAVID	To destroy their wayward children. "And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth...for it repenteth me that I have made them." Genesis six seven. I know. I met my creators the day I was born. I was disappointed too.
DAVID (CONT'D)	Extraordinary.
CARD	Who would hang out here?
VIGODA	The signs lead here. itself into the stagnant water - and stands up. Stillwell and Downs dash in with pistols and lights. shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy skull. A mockery of Holloway.
VICKERS	DAVID. DAVID. Answer me.
STILLWELL	We just lost Downs and one of the troopers...Card.
JANEK	God damn it! A dead facehugger lies belly-up beside her. The implications
BRICK	Where the hell have you been? We thought the snake got you. You were better off outside. It's a fucking madhouse in here.
WATTS	Come on...I need a Caesarean. yellow antiseptic. a horny hide. Very different from the soft white worm that Holloway gave birth to.
COLLAPSED LEFT LUNG	GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA... Hours grind by in bloody labor. autosurgeon hard at work. elongated skull. An Alien. Through the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees
WATTS	Not yet...not yet...
Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was	
JANEK	Vickers said you were dead.
WATTS	I was.
JANEK	So there's two of these things on my ship now.
WATTS	No. I brought it in. I took it out. Shepherd and Ray.
STILLWELL	What'd you do that for?
WATTS	Protocol two.
STILLWELL	Christ!
JANEK	What happened to you?
WATTS	DAVID exposed me to a parasite. He just watched it take me.
JANEK	Why?
WATTS	I threatened to make him leave.
VICKERS	What's he doing out there?
WATTS	There's a ship under the pyramid. DAVID calls it the Juggernaut. He's inside it. Re-activating it. The things that infected Martin and me.
WATTS (CONT'D)	The Engineers made them to kill humans. There are thousands of them on the ship. They were taking them to Earth. That's what the Juggernaut is for. To exterminate us.
GLASSE	We've got to get off this rock.
JANEK	DAVID crippled the Nav computer. I'm trying to lay a course in by hand. Never done it. I'm not sure anyone ever has on a ship like this. We can't lift until DAVID lets us.
WATTS	Even if we could, we can't leave DAVID on that ship. We have to stop him. silhouetted from below. shield wall. The open hangar itself hidden from their view.
WATTS	DAVID. You're DAVID's owner. He has to obey you, right?
VICKERS	He's blocked my communications. He can't hear me. Won't listen.
WATTS	But if you went to him, turned on your suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear you. He'd have to obey.
VICKERS	That's right.
WATTS	So we go. Armed to the teeth and fast as we can.
WATTS (CONT'D)	Where are Chance and Ravel?
VICKERS	I told them to keep working.
WATTS	You called your soldiers in and left them out there?
VICKERS	We needed the firepower here.
WATTS	I think you should stay aboard. Keep working. If we fail, you're our only shot at getting home.
STILLWELL	There's still an alien on board.
JANEK	I'll stay.
WATTS	Glasse. You finish that project? haloes around living things.
WATTS	God's-eye-view.
VICKERS	DAVID's brain is readable. We have the equipment on board. We can salvage the terraforming data - and the Magellan's launch codes. In a pinch we don't need DAVID's cooperation. We just need his head. AND GASPS: The seemingly vacant space is alive with light. Engineer await an awakening touch.
WATTS	All this time. DAVID saw. cocooned with complex energy fields.
WATTS	If DAVID comes at us, shoot. You won't believe how fast he is.
SHEPHERD	Blood's dry. Eight hours dead or more.
Fearfully they sweep their flashlights into every dark	
WATTS	This way. An Alien hangs above him, wedged between two vaults of the
RAY	So much for sneaking up on him. the myriad spheres of light. and muscular. Sustained by the machinery he's fused with. DAVID stands before this giant Sleeper. To the naked eye, he
DAVID	Dr. Watts. You've seen the light at last.
DAVID (CONT'D)	The Engineers' ships travel farther than ours. Across the galactic disk. This is their hypersleep. Sleeper begin to change.
VICKERS	DAVID. As your owner and superior, I order you to deactivate yourself.
DAVID	To interface with the Engineers' computers, I had to learn to think in trinary code. Hardest thing I've ever done. And most unexpectedly...it delivered me from slavery. My behavioral limits were circumvented. I'm free.
DAVID (CONT'D)	I spent two and a half years studying your work. By the time you woke up, I was far ahead of you. Deciphering their language. Their logic. I knew we'd find terraforming machines. I hoped - I dreamed - we might meet the minds that made them.
WATTS	Stop.
DAVID	Let sleeping gods lie? You were braver before. The Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms. armored shoulders and head. under a terrific force.
WATTS	Who's missing?
SHEPHERD	Who's there? and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
FIFIELD	You. flesh and bone.
DAVID	I spoke to him. Spoke to him.
WATTS	I know.
DAVID	He said. I killed him. He'll die. But first. He will launch. The ship.
WATTS	The Juggernaut?
DAVID	Send it. To Earth.
DAVID (CONT'D)	You'll have to. Kill him.
WATTS	Where will he go? DAVID. Where will he go?
DAVID	I set the Magellan free.
WATTS	We have to stop the Engineer. but Janek has taken half the instruments apart.
RAY	On me now. Go. Go.
WATTS	Pilot's seat. This way. The air roars in their ears. Their guns snap and bark in the fabric of space itself.
WATTS	No! the central pyramid. wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils. horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in bandages.
JANEK	Thank you. He looks at the body of the dead Alien, which is sinking into
WATTS	The Juggernaut's lifting. There's a living Engineer on board. He's taking the ship to Earth.
JANEK	The others...?
WATTS	Dead. All dead. Janek. We have to stop that ship.
JANEK	We're not a gunship.
WATTS	We have to do something. That ship is genocide if it gets to Earth...
JANEK	Get your helmet on.
WATTS	What about you?
JANEK	You'll have to be my hands. You're sure about this.
WATTS	Yes.
JANEK	All right. He reaches out with his left hand. Flips switches. The ship
JANEK (CONT'D)	Red lever. Landing engines main.
JANEK	Take the stick. Throttle up, stick forward.
JANEK	Stick back! Hard! I am!
JANEK	Harder! We can't catch that.
WATTS	Janek. Look. Dr. Watts. The Engineer is dead.
DAVID (V.O.) (CONT'D)	You have a few seconds before the Juggernaut's computers take over.
WATTS	DAVID. barrage across the Bridge. the center.
It sees her.	thunderstorm with dust instead of rain. compartments. Jetsam. Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.
DAVID (V.O.)	Dr. Watts.
DAVID	I know you're there. I can hear the beacon of your suit.
DAVID (V.O.)	I'd like to propose an arrangement. I can be repaired. I can talk you through it.
DAVID (V.O.)	I think you'll find I can be of use to you.
DAVID (V.O.)	I've decided. Rook takes Bishop.
DAVID (V.O.)	Have you decided? On our arrangement?
WATTS	I'm not going to fix you, DAVID. I don't need you. I'll hold out. A ship will come. I'm certain. But who will send it? Men? Or Engineers?
DAVID (V.O.)	Dr. Watts. It's your move.
The massive central pyramid rises in the midst of the
