What is she doing with a guy that age? feel Dave was walking out on her. on me? Why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guy's the one who wanted out?

Mme. Barry, que je puis vous obtenir	aujourd'hui? Girl stands BEHIND THE CHEESE COUNTER in:
Bonjour je veux une partie de votre	pate merveilleux et de votre meilleur fromage absolu de chevre. and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of
She started French lessons after she and	my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy, Don't Look Back" program. She's practically fluent now. Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou devrions jefaire quelgue chose? Laissons quelque chose d'achat. Et ce grand gateau de chocolat? Yeah...well. ..I am fluent. Be right back. crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
Merci madame.	heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to Woops. Sorry. so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica company among other things... "Drive By" Records??? Is that a joke? What is that? Okay. That's... "interesting"... headed here. . . rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention just a tad misogynistic. poetry. can you rhyme with 'Bitch'? places her groceries on the check out counter. How we doin? HARRY me. happy with it? places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet. and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica. is a bit of a problem, but so far it's about a divorced woman, a writer, she's this high strung, over-amped, controlling, know it all neurotic. . . Who's incredibly cute and lovable. It's a comedy. the big buyer of the night. conducting the auction and apparently every time I did that she misunderstood and I ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine. and Marin laugh. so far... leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica bachelor? in New York Magazine. that I've escaped the noose for so long. "The Escape Artist"? You were once engaged to somebody big. Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait. ..Carly Simon? Not Martha Stewart.... MARIN not here.
Harry was once engaged to Diane	Sawyer. Okay? I'm impressed.
Yeah, women your age love that	about me. pauses on that one. You know what I mean. your age'. So when was this engagement? adorable lanky girl from Kentucky with the greatest pair of legs I'd ever seen... Never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed them. ERICA she goes into caves in with a shmahtah on her Who cares about her legs? of... You know what? I to eat and run but... dynamic - what's going at this table... . . women. Look at what we have with you and Erica. Harry, been around the block a few right? You're what? Around never been married, which, we know, if you were a woman, be a curse, you'd be an old a spinster, blah, blah, Okay, so instead of pitying they write articles about you, your never marrying, it you illusive and ungettable. a real catch. Then, take my sister here... look at her, she's so the most successful playwright since who? Lillian She's over fifty, and still sits in night night because the available her age want --forgive me honey for saying this, but they want girls that look like Marin so the whole over fifty dating scene is geared completely towards men leaving older women out and as a result that makes the older women more and more productive and more and more interesting, which, in turn, makes them even less desirable because as we all know -- men, especially older men, are threatened and deathly afraid of interesting and accomplished women. It's just so clear. Single older women, as a demographic, are as fucked a group as can ever exist. and Harry's EYES CONNECT for a millisecond. HEAR THE is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to you say those things? injustice of it. Thank God men die younger than us. It's the only break we get. on it, don't announce to the world that I stay in night after night after night and by the way, one night after night would have been enough.
