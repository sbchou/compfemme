TITTERTON	Put him on a plane. Fuck him.
JORDAN	He's half dead and he's in chemo.
BUTLER	We took him in. He's ours now.
TITTERTON	So we'll take in any prick as long as he's got cancer?
JORDAN	No. Just the pricks on our side. So all our other pricks on their prick thrones know, when they get run out on a rail, they won't be getting their spleens out by a camel vet in the Sinai.

JORDAN	We've got 60 in the embassy with guns to their heads right now --
TITTERTON	The eyes of the world are on the embassy. That makes them safer than the six on the street.

O'DONNELL	Traffic calls them The Houseguests. Haven't left the Canadian ambassador's house since it happened.
MENDEZ	Compromised?
O'DONNELL	Just a matter of time. We've got Revolutionary Guards going door-to- door like Jehovah's Witnesses, looking for escapees. They're out for blood, Tony. Half of them think Khomeini's been too lenient with the ones in the embassy. Walking out of his office, Mendez following.
MENDEZ	White House?
O'DONNELL	Carter's shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids. He wants the six of them out.
MENDEZ	Who else knows?
O'DONNELL	Just the families. Meanwhile, some genius in the embassy was keeping a mug book of everybody who worked there.
MENDEZ	Jesus Christ.
O'DONNELL	We think it got shredded before they got in, but the fuckers have sweat-shop kids in there re- assembling the shreds.
O'DONNELL	They're gonna make an example of the ones who escaped. Standing- room-only for beheadings in the square.
MENDEZ	Who's handling? They walk through a door and out of the Pit.
O'DONNELL	State's coordinating in-house.
MENDEZ	They don't do exfils.
O'DONNELL	They do now. They want to run it by us, strictly as consultants. Off his look.
O'DONNELL	Engell's saying it's lose-lose. These people die, they die badly. Publicly. 혱State wants the blame, he'll give it to them.
MENDEZ	Then why's he want me?
O'DONNELL	So he can tell State he ran it by his best exfil guy. They stop in front of a conference room. Jack looks at
O'DONNELL	Tony. This isn't the kind of meeting where you talk. Other CIA Operations OFFICERS and ANALYSTS sit in
ENGELL	Okay. This is Bob Pender from State O.S. He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff. GENCO, a State Department Assistant, removes a drape from

PENDER	Bob Anders. Senior consular officer, oldest of the group. Most likely to be group leader. So.
PENDER (CONT'D)	What we like for this are bicycles. We've identified backroads from the Shemiran district -- a couple of rat lines through the mountains to the crossing at Tabriz. Cars are off the table because of the roadblocks. Pender nods to Bates, who gs to a map, indicating the
BATES	We wait till the weather clears up then we deliver six bikes and provide maps to the Turkish border.
PENDER	We have intelligence they can ride bicycles. Or we're prepared to send in somebody to teach them. The professional spies shifting at the stupidity of it.
MENDEZ	You can send in training wheels and wait at the border with Gatorade. Attention turns to Mendez. O'Donnell shifts. Engell,
MENDEZ	It's 300 miles to the Turkish crossings. They'd need a support crew behind them with a tire pump.
ENGELL PENDER	We've only been asked to sharpshoot this, State's handling the op.
O'DONNELL	Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot of the shah's people out after the fall. If these people can read OR add, any minute they're gonna figure out they're six short of a full deck.

PENDER	Snow.
MENDEZ	So what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under Frosty? Pender shifts.
MENDEZ	Exfils are like abortions. You don't wanna need one, but when you do, you don't do it yourself. The meeting is breaking up. Pender, followed by Bates, You have a better plan? Mendez dsn't respond.

MENDEZ	Six got away. They're hiding in the city. I'm going over to get them.
CHAMBERS	What am I making?
MENDEZ	I need you to help me make a fake movie.
CHAMBERS	You've come to the right place.
MENDEZ	I need to set up a production company and build a cover around making a movie.
CHAMBERS	That we're not going to make.
MENDEZ	No.
CHAMBERS	You want to go around Hollywood acting like you're an important person in the movie business.
MENDEZ	That's right.
CHAMBERS	But you don't want to actually do anything.
MENDEZ	No.
CHAMBERS	You'll fit right in. ARGO - Final 36.
CHAMBERS	This one's got an M.A. in English. She should be your screenwriter. Sometimes they go on scouts 혱cause they want the free meals. This guy's the director.
MENDEZ	Can you teach a guy how to be a director in a day?
CHAMBERS	You can teach a rhesus monkey to be a director in a day. Look, if you're gonna do it, you've got to do it. The Khomaniacs are fruit loops, but they have cousins selling eight tracks and prayer rugs on La Brea. You can't build cover stories around a movie that dsn't exist. You need a script. You need a producer.

SIEGEL	Nobody makes Westerns anymore.
CHAMBERS	It's ancient Troy.
SIEGEL	If it's got horses in the title, it's a Western.
CHAMBERS	Yeah, Kenny, please. It's John Chambers, about the office space. It dsn't matter. It's a fake movie.
SIEGEL	If I'm doing a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit. Is A006 still open on the lot?

MENDEZ	Why do we need the option?
SIEGEL	You're worried about the Ayatollah? Try the WGA.
SIEGEL	He's only a prick if you catch him on the wrong day.
MENDEZ	Is it the wrong day?
SIEGEL	It's always the wrong day. They've arrived at a door with a sign: MAX KLEIN
KLEIN	You're gonna get this into production in one month?
MENDEZ	One month.
KLEIN	Who are you again?
MENDEZ	Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.
SIEGEL	He's the money.
KLEIN	I thought you were retired, Lester.
SIEGEL	-- Till I read the Argo. Look, how 혱bout we say fifteen thou and close on this?
KLEIN	You want me to be honest with you, Les?
SIEGEL	Naah, bullshit me, Max.
KLEIN	Okay. Because I enjoyed your films, the early ones. I took this meeting out of respect because I wanted to tell you 혱no' to your face.
SIEGEL	Thank you. Very respectful.
KLEIN	You're done, Lester. You've gotta get your cataracts fixed and read the trades. MGM just capitalized for six new films and they're desperate for Sci-Fi. They've already offered me four times what you are. What can I say? Congratulations. He's got me. A beat. Mendez ready to go --
SIEGEL	But see -- it worries me, what you said, and I'll tell you why. A couple weeks back I was sitting in Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai when my pal Warren Beatty came to wish me well and we had a little chat. Seems he was attached to star in Zulu Empire -- which was gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but Warren confided in me that the picture's gone over-budget 혱cause the Zulu extras wanna unionize.
SIEGEL (CONT'D)	They may be cannibals swallowing each other up but they want health and dental, so the movie's kaput -- which means that MGM deal ain't gonna happen and your script ain't worth the buffalo-shit on a nickel. So. Lester takes some documents out of a folder.
SIEGEL	through the cataracts, I grant you -- is that you can either sign here and take ten thousand for your toilet-paper script -- or you can go fuck yourself. Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts
MENDEZ	You know Warren Beatty?
SIEGEL	I took a leak next to him at the Golden Globes. Taco?
MENDEZ	You got kids, Lester?
SIEGEL	Two daughters.
MENDEZ	You see them much?
SIEGEL	I talk to them once a year, maybe.
MENDEZ	Why's that?
SIEGEL	I was a terrible father. The bullshit business is like coal mining. You can't wash it off before you kiss your wife and kids... You?
MENDEZ	A son. Lives with his mother in Virginia.
SIEGEL	You're divorced?
MENDEZ	Taking time off. He's gotta... stay where he is. Kids need the mother.
O'DONNELL	They caught the shah's chief of security trying to get on a plane to Paris.
MENDEZ	혱War' sounds like Star Wars. Let's use a different word. Mendez closes the door to his private office.
O'DONNELL	혱Since the incident, the number of guards at the airport has doubled. Thorough background examinations should be expected.'
MENDEZ	I need another week.
O'DONNELL	You don't have it. They have hung up all their ARGO MATERIALS on the wall
MENDEZ	We've got a script. We've got business cards.We've got a poster. If I'm them? It's nothing we couldn't make at home.
CHAMBERS	I did a movie with Rock Hudson once. 혱You need to sell a lie, you get the press to sell it for you.'

MARK LIJEK	A hundred and twelve --

CHAMBERS (V.O.)	혱Crane down over the battlefield and hold there...' 혱... on a single red flower growing from the ruins of the starship in the desert. Fade to black. The End.' And there is a photo of Mendez from the press event.
MENDEZ	Why'd he do it? He did it 혱cause he did it.
O'DONNELL	He saw a covert intelligence officer saying 혱cheese' with R2- D2. They're going with the teachers.
MENDEZ	It's a death sentence, Jack.
O'DONNELL	Well then it's on Engell. It's done, Tony. Wash your hands. He hangs up. Mendez, looking out the hotel window at
SIEGEL	I made thirty pictures. Half of them the pricks upstairs tried to shut me down. Mendez finishes packing, zips up the bag.
SIEGEL	My ass is staying right here and running a movie company. Mendez stops zipping as Siegel takes a bottle of Jack and Ey. The first shot of the picture. Lester gives glasses to each of them. Chambers holds up
CHAMBERS	Argo fuck yourself. They raise to that.
MENDEZ AND SIEGEL	Argo fuck yourself. They each do a shot. Then Tony picks up his bag and
MENDEZ	How'd you always get around the pricks upstairs?
SIEGEL	There's always another prick one floor higher up.
O'DONNELL	What did you do to get the meeting?
MENDEZ	I used your name. Jack looks to Tony.
MENDEZ	You can forget about that time- share in Ocean City, Jack.
DAY	Tony and O'Donnell sit in the waiting area, across from a
O'DONNELL	Brace yourself. It's like talking to those two old fucks on 혱The Muppets.' Vance and Turner enter the room without recognizing them.
DAY	A concept drawing from Argo.
TURNER (O.S.)	Aliens and robots. Yes, sir.
ANOTHER ANGLE	The four men are gathered in the back of Vance's office, TURNER is looking at the storyboard.
TURNER	You're telling me there's a movie office in Hollywood right now that's funded by the Central Intelligence Agency.
MENDEZ	Yes, sir.
VANCE	What's wrong with the bikes again? Vance, with a copy of Comics Week. THE NEXT STAR WARS?
TURNER O'DONNELL	... you think this -- We tried to get the message
TURNER	-- this is more plausible than teachers?
O'DONNELL	One, there are no foreign teachers in Iran anymore --
MENDEZ	-- two, we think everybody knows Hollywood people. And everybody thinks they would shoot during Stalingrad with Pol Pot directing if it'd sell tickets. There are only bad options. It's about finding the best one.
TURNER	You don't have a better bad idea than this?
O'DONNELL	This is the best bad idea we have, sir. By far. Vance and Turner exchange looks. The United States government just sanctioned your science fiction movie.
O'DONNELL	I'm required to remind you that if you're detained, the agency will not claim you.
MENDEZ	Barely claim me as it is.
O'DONNELL	Your 혱In Case Of's' good?

JORDAN	Who signed off on this?
CONSUL OFFICIAL	What will be the purpose of your visit to Iran?
MENDEZ	Business. Film production. The Consul Official looks at his Canadian passport.
CONSUL OFFICIAL	Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?
MENDEZ	My boss waited until I was here to send the telex. If he had a thought in his head, it would die of loneliness. Pointed look from Mendez. The universal condition of

NICHOLLS	Mr. Harkins.
MENDEZ	When'd you get back?
MENDEZ	Were you metal detecting?
NICHOLLS	None left to find. Shah escaped with a 747 so laden with gold bars it nearly didn't make it off the runway.
MENDEZ	But you kept busy.
NICHOLLS	Ferrying out the torture apparatus of our friend's fallen dictatorship. Both these men do this work and share an unspoken Nicholls has WHITE AND YELLOW SLIPS OF PAPER with Farsi
NICHOLLS	It's getting worse. Everybody who lands at Mehrabad now fills out one of these. That slip makes a copy to this one underneath. Passenger keeps Yellow, Airport keeps White.
NICHOLLS (CONT'D)	When you leave the country, they match them up to verify you came into the country when you said you did.
MENDEZ	So if they look, they'll know six people didn't come in with me.
NICHOLLS	If they look. Nicholls and Tony turn away from the mosaic, surreptitious work now done, and meander toward the
NICHOLLS	When you land, you should go straight to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to kiss the ring. Get on record as having applied for a film permit. If they catch you later, at least they'll be confused while they're torturing you... Your biggest problem may be convincing the six of them to go with you. They're foreign service. They're willful. Nicholls takes a picture.
MENDEZ	How's June?
NICHOLLS	Left.
MENDEZ	I'm sorry.
NICHOLLS	She picked out a ring and gave me a choice. She's a Chinese national. If I married her, I'd have to resign, so. You and Christine?
MENDEZ	Good. Yeah. He said that without hesitation. Maybe here we realize
PRODUCER	You're working late.
SIEGEL	혱Til the dawn's early light.

BEHROUZ	This film crew is just yourself?
MENDEZ	Six more are joining me today. They're coming from Canada.
BEHROUZ	You'd like to film at the bazaar?
MENDEZ	The bazaar, maybe the palace. I see. The exotic Orient. Snake charmers and flying carpets. You come to us at a complicated time. Before the Revolution, 40 percent of the movie theaters in Tehran were showing pornography. Our function is purification as well as promotion of the arts. I'll review for the Minister. Mendez, carrying his luggage, stands at a wrought iron
MENDEZ	Mr. Ambassador.
TAYLOR	Ken Taylor. He shakes Tony's hand and they start to walk to Taylor's
TAYLOR	I was expecting more of a G-Man look.
MENDEZ	You're thinking of FBI, sir. They get into the car.
TAYLOR	These are blank, y'know. The stamps?
MENDEZ	I'll take care of that.
TAYLOR	How long?
MENDEZ	A day to prep them with their cover stories. Two if they need it.
TAYLOR	And you'll fly out with them? Tony nods. A distant sound of a crowd outside.
TAYLOR	There's something you should know. We think one of our housekeepers figured out who they are. We don't know if we can trust her. Now the noise outside is louder. Taylor turns to the
TAYLOR	So sooner is better. They stand listening to the demonstration sounds, echoing
O'DONNELL	He got to the embassy. O'Donnell closes the door. Pender, wearing an undone
O'DONNELL	I can't tell you more than that 혱cause I don't know any more.
PENDER	The Times and A.P. found out they're with the Canadians. Somebody in one of the families talked.
O'DONNELL	Mother of God.
PENDER	I just put Vance on a plane to take the editors to Le Cirque. He thinks he can get them to sit on it. For now. Your guy better get them and get the hell out.
NIGHT	Each Houseguest has a copy of the ARGO script.
BOB ANDERS	It's theater of the absurd.
MARK LIJEK	What are the chances?
MENDEZ	The chances are good.
MARK LIJEK	What's the number value of 혱good'? 30 percent chance of success? 80 percent?
CORA LIJEK	We just --
BOB ANDERS	What was the objection to picking normal cover identities?
MENDEZ	There are no Canadians in the country for normal reasons.
KATHY STAFFORD MARK LIJEK	They'll sniff us out The Swedish consul said regardless. they accused him of being an American at the airport and held him for an hour.
BOB ANDERS	We can't stand up to that. We don't know what the hell movie people do.
MENDEZ	That's why I'm here. I'll be with you. This is what I do.
CORA LIJEK	Have you gotten people out this way before?
MENDEZ	This would be a first. minus J and Kathy Stafford, go into the living room.
J STAFFORD KATHY STAFFORD	Do you know that every ... J, don't. day...
J STAFFORD	... every day they catch another friend of the shah at the airport. Kangaroo trials then firing squads. Just for having American names in their phone books. He puts the Iranian newspaper in front of Mendez.
J STAFFORD	You've been here an hour and you're asking us to trust you with our lives, Mr. --
MENDEZ	Harkins.
J STAFFORD	Is that your real name? A beat.
MENDEZ	No. J Stafford nods, as if this has proven a point. He in the Tehran Times. A MAN IN A SUIT at Mehrabad
TAYLOR	We've got orders to close the embassy and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay. I'm serious, too. This is what?
BOB ANDERS J STAFFORD	Don't do this, J... ... the part where we say, 혱That's so crazy it just might work'? C'mon...
BOB ANDERS	I saw it in Burma. They get people out. They know how.
J STAFFORD	Snitches in banana republics. They get them over the border after the coup...
BOB ANDERS J STAFFORD	That's your opinion. ... pay the guards at the crossing a hundred bucks to look the other way...
MARK LIJEK	His opinion got us out of the embassy in the first place. If we go, you need to leave immediately. There's a
TAYLOR	Pat and I discussed it. If they catch you at the airport, they come here and we go on trial for harboring the enemy. It's a risk we took. Can you pull this off?
MENDEZ	I don't know.
J STAFFORD	-- even if they do. They find us here, we're not lying, we're just hiding. We go out there with fake passports, we're spies, period, execution.
CORA LIJEK	So how long do we stay? A month? A year?
J STAFFORD	That man out there, he's got bad cards, he's gonna lose. If he loses, it's our lives.
KATHY STAFFORD	And his life too. Another beat. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
MENDEZ	Your cover identities were created specifically for each one of you. Mendez, now dressed to leave, is handing each Houseguest What I need you to do is memorize everything inside. Who you are, what you are, where you've been. Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope.
MENDEZ	When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people. Mendez nods at them, and gs. The Houseguests look at
BELLHOP	Sir, a telex arrived for you. The BELLHOP hands Tony a piece of paper. He reads it. radio. On either side of the board: telephone jacks. He detaches the cords from the hotel phone and plugs them
MENDEZ (V.O.)	혱The Minister of Culture and Guidance has approved your location scout.'
MENDEZ	혱He will send a representative to meet you and your crew at the Khayyam entrance to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.'
O'DONNELL	They called your bluff.
MENDEZ	Or maybe they're cooperating.
O'DONNELL	N.E. says absolutely not. Seven Americans walking the bazaar, you're asking for a riot, it's the
MENDEZ	Seven Canadians, Jack.
O'DONNELL	Never give them multiple shots at a cover. Are they even ready?
MENDEZ	They're getting there.
O'DONNELL	Terrific. There's no prize for 혱Most Improved.' I don't have a choice. We say no, they come to the residence and pull everyone out at gunpoint. How do you think the covers hold up with their fingernails pulled out?
J STAFFORD	혱We are a nation of 35 million and... many of these people are looking forward to martyrdom.혱 Kathy Stafford looks into the room. J stops talking, Five minutes? He smiles at her. Kathy, who looks like she hasn't been
J STAFFORD	She pleaded with me. Mark, looking to J. This is new.

Show Newsom you've got the balls. Grab for the ring.' I think we're gonna die here. Behrouz stands next to ALI KHALKALI, 30s, a Revolutionary Now on the level WITH CAMERA, we carry him INTO the This isn't what we agreed to.
MORNING	The Houseguests are gathered in the office. Cora hands
CORA LIJEK	You said 혱a day to learn your covers then straight to the airport.' You said that.
BOB ANDERS	They suspect something? What I know is we need to act like a movie crew. We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow. Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford,
J STAFFORD	We won't do it.
MARK LIJEK	He told them there were six of us. They're expecting six. You are about to show the only card we're holding. Which is that they don't know we're here.
MENDEZ	I'm asking you to trust me.
J STAFFORD	I don't trust you.
BOB ANDERS	What's the alternative? This is the ball game, J. What world are you living in?
J STAFFORD	The one where they're hanging people from construction cranes, Bob. J takes Kathy's hand and gs, leaving Mendez with the So we'll see you at two? Some HEADSHOTS are in various stages of repair. Dozens of documents are now complete, sitting on the
PAT TAYLOR	This one. She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin,
CORA LIJEK	So don't be recognizable, but look exactly like your passport picture.
MARK LIJEK	Not that picture. You won't want to scare them. A nervous smile. Trying to deal with anxiety.
PAT TAYLOR	Hello? A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.
PAT TAYLOR	No, there's no one like that here. She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the
BOB ANDERS	Who was it? Pat shakes her head.
ON J STAFFORD	listening. Kathy takes his hand. Somebody knows.
Tony getting dressed. Thinking.	He gets up and leaves, and we start to hear the sound of
MENDEZ	This one, how much? One day, how much? They turn when they see Tony come in the door.
MENDEZ	I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow.
J STAFFORD	I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.
MENDEZ	My name is Tony Mendez. Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and ARGO - Final 80. Then he looks in the rearview and sees one of the back They stop at the demonstration, then realize people
MENDEZ	Tell me who you are. This recalls attention from the windows.
LEE SCHATZ	Mike McEwan, cameraman.
BOB ANDERS	Robert Baker, director.
MARK LIJEK	Timothy Harris, location manager.
CORA LIJEK	Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.
KATHY STAFFORD	Rachel Dewart, production designer. Kathy looks at her husband.
J STAFFORD	Sean Bissett, associate producer.
MENDEZ	Let's make a movie. A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits. This is REZA, mid- Guidance. Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The Bob Anders walks toward the front.
REZA	You are the director?
BOB ANDERS	Yes. Is this film a foreign bride film?
BOB ANDERS	I'm sorry?
REZA	A film where a foreign bride is brought to Iran, but she dsn't understand the language and customs and there are misunderstandings and laughs.
BOB ANDERS	No.
REZA	Mmmm. Mendez walking toward the back of the group. Lee, the Mike?
LEE SCHATZ	Yeh.
MENDEZ	If I said you were looking through the wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right? Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it
LEE SCHATZ	Yep.
ANGLE	Mendez talking to Lee from a distance. A zoom, a closer Ali Khalkali, the revolutionary official, gets out of one Sahar is moving through the garden, she sees the men
SAHAR	Yes? ARGO - Final 83. Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout, He wants the photograph you took.
MENDEZ	She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.
REZA	He says he did not give you permission to take a photograph of his store. Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather.
KATHY STAFFORD	He can have the photograph. Tell The Shopkeeper knocks the Polaroid out of her hand. When did they arrive? I'm sorry? The guests of the ambassador. How long have they been in this house? America NO!... NO! Then he speaks in Farsi and makes shooting gestures with
LEE SCHATZ	He's saying the Shah killed his son with an American gun. Cauldron heating up and -- ON Sahar -- her face impassive -- and then -- Two days. They arrived two days ago. Khalkali looks to the other Officials. A CROWD starts to gather around the group.
ON KATHY	Her claustrophobia as the crowd closes in -- an ANGRY
CORA LIJEK	Canada... Ca-na-da... She's showing a Canadian flag, Bob Anders' lapel button --
LEE SCHATZ	He says we're the CIA taking photographs to plan the bombing of the city.
DAY	Khalkali eyes Sahar, gauging her. She hides her fear Sister, those who are with him, Rasool of Allah, we are tender among ourselves. But stern against the kuffar.
SAHAR	As god wills it. But those who sit silently have sinned. Ds he know? Ds he not know? Is he trying to trick
DAY	-- and Sahar, so dignified and stony she is almost
SAHAR	Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran. Khalkali makes his decision. He wordlessly turns to go. After she ds, she lets the facade go. All of a sudden
TAYLOR	They drew you out there to take your picture.
MENDEZ	Nobody broke. At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, And tomorrow? A beat on Mendez, who stamps out his cigarette and
MENDEZ	Tomorrow they'll be ready. We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to
MENDEZ	Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
ANDERS	Vancouver.
MENDEZ	Where were you born?
BOB ANDERS	Toronto.
MENDEZ	Toronno like piranha. Canadians don't pronounce the T.
LEE SCHATZ	Some border guard's gonna know that?
MENDEZ	If you're held for questioning, they'll bring in somebody who knows that.
MENDEZ	Last three Canadian prime minsters.
CORA LIJEK	Trudeau, Pearson, Diefenbaker.
MENDEZ	Good. Your job on the film.
J STAFFORD	Producer.
MENDEZ	Associate Producer. What's the name of the last film you worked on?
J STAFFORD	Uh... High and Dry.
MENDEZ	Who paid for the movie?
MENDEZ	What's your middle name? J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the
MENDEZ	He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated --
MENDEZ	They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your r횄짤sum횄짤 so well that you don't flinch.
J STAFFORD	You think your little story will matter when there's guns to our heads?
MENDEZ	My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat. Mendez puts the r횄짤sum횄짤 back in front of Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't
MENDEZ	Let's go again. They made it through the location scout. O'Donnell ignores him. He gs straight to his office. Ken Taylor emerges. Waits a beat.
TAYLOR	Kevin. Mendez picks up the complicated-looking satellite phone
O'DONNELL	Go to black on green. Jack's calling him here, so he knows something's wrong.
MENDEZ	What is it?
O'DONNELL	Go to black on green. Mendez turns knobs on the satellite phone.
O'DONNELL	It all just changed. They called the game. You've got to come back. ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing.
O'DONNELL	Joint Chiefs are planning a military rescue of the hostages in a month. Delta Force started training to storm the grounds. So if the six of them get brought down there, they won't be held for long.
MENDEZ	I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out.
O'DONNELL	It's over, Tony.
MENDEZ	They will be taken. Probably not
O'DONNELL	LISTEN TO ME. The thinking's changed. Six Americans get pulled out of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed, it's another world outrage. Six Americans get caught playing movie make-believe with the CIA at the airport and executed, it's a national embarrassment. They're calling the operation.
MENDEZ	We're responsible for those people. What we are is required to follow orders. I'm sorry. Mendez hangs up. O'Donnell sits listening to the dial Then, very suddenly, he looks at an old coffee cup near Maybe only a minute, maybe ten or more have passed.
CORA LIJEK	We're ready to try again.
MENDEZ	I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest. Now the mood among the Houseguests is lighter. Bob
BOB ANDERS	Scorched earth policy tonight. Nothing gets left. Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at
MENDEZ	So you know. ExtAff wants you to burn the passports before you leave. Mendez looks at the Houseguests, setting the table.
TAYLOR	If we tell them, they'll panic. It's better if you just don't show.
TAYLOR (CONT'D)	It was always a fucked mission. You came closer than anybody else. Kathy and Cora are cracking each other up. There is a dangling TOTEM from the rearview mirror. It He passes a VAN ON FIRE.
CHAMBERS	It's off. They want us to pack up the office. A beat on Lester. He's devastated but he's not showing
SIEGEL	They can wait. Let's go get a drink. Ken Taylor watches in the hall. Cora Lijek is sitting next to her husband.
KATHY STAFFORD	He's late. distance. HOLD for a long beat ON Tony. Thinking. His phone rings. He picks up.
O'DONNELL	Yeah. ARGO - Final 94.
MENDEZ	Somebody is responsible for things when things happen, Jack. I am responsible. I'm taking them through. And before Jack can answer, Tony hangs up. Stands. A Rushing out of his office, into --
O'DONNELL	We need to confirm those seven tickets out of Tehran on
SOSA	N.E. shut that down.
O'DONNELL	I'm saying it's back on!
SOSA	I can't do it. It's backstopped pending Executive Branch GO.
O'DONNELL	What the fuck ds that mean?
SOSA	Carter's got to say yes for us to get the tickets. She's shocked to see him. Ken Taylor now appears behind
O'DONNELL	Where's Engell?
SECRETARY	He's in a meeting.
O'DONNELL	Pull him out.
PAT TAYLOR	Sahar's on a bus.
MENDEZ	Good. And you two leave right now. Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand. We see Ken's black embassy sedan waiting, driven by a
PAKISTANI DRIVER.	Mendez pulls away.
TAYLOR	Get to your flight.
ENGELL	N.E. said NO, this is not a long- leasher...
O'DONNELL ENGELL	... watching a show behind ... and it never has been, mirror... gs...
O'DONNELL	It is going.
ENGELL	You're goddamn close...
O'DONNELL	Am I goddamn close?
ENGELL	You're goddamn close to the line with me. I'm not leaving him at the airport with six people and his dick in his hand. Tell the Director to call the White House. DO YOUR
FUCKING JOB.	Engell just stares O'Donnell down.
MENDEZ (V.O.)	The first checkpoint is just to look at your passport.
MENDEZ	Your passports came straight from the Canadians, so you're gonna be fine. O'Donnell, charging in --
O'DONNELL	Where's the Director?
MALINOV	He's on the plane.
O'DONNELL	Find White House Chief of Staff.
MALINOV	How would I find him?
O'DONNELL	We're a fucking SPY AGENCY! FIND
MENDEZ	The second checkpoint --
MALINOV	Jordan's in the West Wing. He's not taking calls. A beat on O'Donnell.
O'DONNELL	Where are his kids?
O'DONNELL	Where do his kids go to school?
MENDEZ	The second is immigration. You'll hand them these. They say you landed two days ago.
MENDEZ (V.O.)	These guys are bureaucrats left over from the shah. They can't be bothered to second-guess you.
MALINOV	Pace Academy in Buckhead, Georgia! O'Donnell dials a number.
O'DONNELL	Yes, it's Mr. Murphy calling from Pace Academy for Mr. Jordan... I'm afraid it IS an emergency...
WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR	Hold just a moment. She plugs a wire into an old-fashioned Ma Bell
MENDEZ (V.O.)	Third checkpoint is the trap.
MENDEZ	It's manned by Revolutionaries. Most of them were educated in the U.S. or Europe.
BOB ANDERS	Or Canada?
MENDEZ	They know how many 혱T's are in Toronto.
JORDAN	Hello?
O'DONNELL (V.O.)	Jack O'Donnell from C.I.
JORDAN	Wait -- WHO -- ?
O'DONNELL (V.O.)	Tehran Houseguest operation is ready NOW. We don't have the President's go-ahead. They are going to be captured. Jordan stands up with the phone.
JORDAN	DAVID! Pick up! KHALKALI, the fiery guy who came to the residence, along
LAMONT	Telex on Flash. The telex begins to print, line by line...
O'DONNELL	Copy D.S.! Confirm the tickets!
SWISSAIR REP	I'm sorry, sir. I don't have those reservations... SWISSAIR REP looks at some green text on her screen, hits
SWISSAIR REP	My apologies. They just came through. She hits another button and tickets start to print.
MALINOV	Swissair says they've picked up the tickets.
O'DONNELL	Get the L.A. office -- tell them to be ready in case they call.
MALINOV	We told them to shut that down! He RUNS toward a phone -- He starts to leaf through the photographs from the Mark Lijek being photographed at the bazaar the previous looks at the black and white still of Mark Lijek,
IMMIGRATION OFFICER #2	Nothing.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	When did you say you arrived in Iran?
BOB ANDERS	Two days ago.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	What was the purpose of your visit?
BOB ANDERS	We were looking at locations to make a film. I'm the director. Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the We have a letter from the Minister of Culture ... The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter. Bob Moradi picks up the phone as Khalkali heads out.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Okay -- Yes -- Okay -- He waves them through. Second checkpoint done.
MALINOV	C'mon c'mon c'mon --
P.A.	I'm sorry, we're shooting. He motions for them to wait. A movie -- it looks like a Swissair announces general boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich. Passengers, mostly European businessmen, get up and They have created their own checkpoint. It looks recent,
KOMITEH #1	Passports. He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost
KOMITEH #1	You come. He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened-
LAMONT	Purser's telling Swissair they're not on the plane.
O'DONNELL	They should have boarded already.
MALINOV	Still no answer in L.A.
MARK LIJEK	A film. Mark mimes turning the rotor of a movie camera. Komiteh
AZIZI (O.S.)	Sit down. A young man with a beard -- AZIZI, late 20s -- arriving
