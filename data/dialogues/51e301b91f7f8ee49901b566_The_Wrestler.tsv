NICK VOLPE	Two words: Re. Match.
NICK VOLPE (CONT'D)	I'm doing a big Fanfest thing down in South Carolina that weekend. I wanna main-event it with you two.
RANDY	Yeah?
NICK VOLPE	Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary. Hundreds, thousands of screaming fans watching you two make history for the second time.
RANDY	Think Bob'd get back in there? He's pretty retired.
NICK VOLPE	For this? I bet he'd be willing to dust off the old turban.
BIG CHRIS	Whassup, Ram? How ya been?
RANDY	Yo, Big Chris.
BIG CHRIS	Hey, can you get me any more of that IGF-1?

DUDE #2 (O.S.)	The redhead. With the belly chain.
CASSIDY	Sorry, guys, she's on break. Well, I'm sorry, but we don't want you.
DUDE #3	How old are you, anyway?
BACHELOR	You're, like, my mom's age.
CASSIDY	There's nothing like experience. I've done things your little fiancee's never dreamed of...
DUDE #2	Yeah, like graduate in 1985.
RANDY	Apologize to this lady.
DUDE #3	Who the hell are you?
RANDY	You speak to her with respect.
CASSIDY	I got this. It's okay.
RANDY	No, it's not okay. This is definitely not okay.
RANDY (CONT'D)	I guarantee this woman's 50 times hotter than whatever goombah skank you're about to marry. You hear what he just called Gina?!
DUDE #1	That's my fuckin' sister!
DUDE #2 DUDE #1	Jesus!! What the FUCK!!
CASSIDY	Thanks a lot. That was 200 bucks just walked out.
RANDY	I was just trying to help.
CASSIDY	Did I ask for help? Did I need help?
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Then don't fuckin' help.
RANDY	You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
CASSIDY	That's okay.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Good to see ya, man.
RANDY	We're talking one of the historic matches in history. 20,000 people. Another million and a half watching at home on pay-per-view.
RANDY (CONT'D)	We were going back and forth, just killin' each other for a half hour. Any wrestling fan, they know all about it.
CASSIDY	Million and a half? Shit.
RANDY	Yeah, it was big. So a rematch... History all over again.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Goddamn you are smokin'.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Who knows. I put on a good show...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Could be the thing that gets me back on top.
CASSIDY	You never know who's in that crowd.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Jesus.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	You're bleeding.
RANDY	Got cut tonight.
CASSIDY	You okay?
RANDY	Ah, it's nothing.
CASSIDY	And they say wrestling's fake.
RANDY	How's this for fake? What's that from?
RANDY	1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. Loose nail tore the bicep open.
CASSIDY	Ow. Fuck.
RANDY	I got even better. 1988. Orlando Arena. Mr. Magnificent tossed me out of the ring. Landed on my shoulder, clavicle snapped in half.
CASSIDY	Doesn't it hurt?
RANDY	Not when they're going crazy for you...
CASSIDY	"He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we were healed."
RANDY	What's that?
CASSIDY	It's from "Passion of the Christ". You never seen it? Dude, you gotta. It's amazing.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	It's, like, so inspiring. They throw everything at Him. Whips, arrows, rocks... Just beat the living fuck out of Him for the whole two hours. And He just takes it.
RANDY	Huh. I'll have to check it out.
CASSIDY	The sacrificial Ram...
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Ah, shit.
CLUB D.J. (O.S.)	And now, please welcome to the Cheetah's stage...
CLUB D.J. (O.S.) (CONT'D)	...the lovely Cassidy!
RANDY	What do I owe?
CASSIDY	Just gimme for three.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	You'll wait `til I'm done?
LEX LETHAL	Thanks for the lift, bro.
RANDY	No prob. You're right on the way.
RANDY (CONT'D)	So how big's this place?
LEX LETHAL	Nice. Two, two-fifty... You been there. The Ricky Whipsaw memorial benefit.
RANDY	That place?
LEX LETHAL	Should get a good gate. DiFusco says he's gotten like 20 calls last two days alone.
RANDY	God bless hardcore...
RANDY	Whatcha think?
LEX LETHAL	Cookie trays were better.
LEX LETHAL (CONT'D)	Hell, yeah.
RANDY	Let's see if they got extension cords.

DR. TARACHANDANI	A lot better than before the bypass.
RANDY	Great. So I'm all good.
DR. TARACHANDANI	Your heart... You're going to have to start taking much better care of it.
RANDY	Like...
DR. TARACHANDANI	For starters, you must take your medication every day.
RANDY	I could handle that.
DR. TARACHANDANI	No smoking. And no cocaine.
RANDY	I don't do coke.
DR. TARACHANDANI	It's all over your blood work.
RANDY	Maybe once in a while.
DR. TARACHANDANI	Well, it has to be never.
DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)	As for exercise, it's still okay, as long as it's moderate.
RANDY	So, like, wrestling...
DR. TARACHANDANI	Not a good idea.
RANDY	What if I do it moderate? I could hold back on certain moves. There's always ways to fake----
DR. TARACHANDANI	Mr. Ramovic...
RANDY	Randy.
DR. TARACHANDANI	Randy, a man with your heart should not be flying around a ring crashing into people.
RANDY	With all due respect, Dr... ...Trachanani, I'd like a second opinion on that.
DR. TARACHANDANI	Of course. But I promise you, any doctor I showed your file would say the same thing.
DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)	You almost died. The next time, you won't be so lucky.
RANDY	I want a second opinion.
DR. TARACHANDANI	Your heart's been through a lot. Even before the heart attack, it was significantly----
RANDY	I want a second opinion. I WANT A SECOND OPINION.
ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN	This is your copy.

RANDY	What square?
ADAM	That you're hitting me with.
RANDY	It's a folding chair.
ADAM	That's a chair?
RANDY	Yes, it's a chair.
ADAM	This is old.
RANDY	1988 ain't old.
ADAM	That was, like, 50 years before I was born.
RANDY	Shut up and fight. Ad-aam!
ADAM	Coming!
RANDY	Ready?
RANDY	One more?
ADAM	I gotta go.
RANDY	Don't you wanna get even? I whipped your butt.
ADAM	That's okay.
CASSIDY	Hey, sweetie. You're back soon.

RANDY (CONT'D)	Hey, feel like maybe grabbing a burger?
CASSIDY	I'm working.
RANDY	How `bout later, then?
CASSIDY	You okay?
RANDY	Can we talk for a sec?
CASSIDY	Sure. What's up?
RANDY	Someplace more quiet.
CASSIDY	Randy, I can't leave with a customer.
RANDY	I had a heart attack.
CASSIDY	Shit. When?
RANDY	I needed to talk to somebody.
CASSIDY	You can't talk here?
RANDY	Just a couple minutes.
CASSIDY	Randy, I don't do that.
RANDY	Please.
CASSIDY	Where are you parked?
RANDY	In back.
CASSIDY	Go to your car. I'll meet you out there in 15 minutes.
RANDY	Thanks. I appreciate it.
CASSIDY	That's okay.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	When was it?
RANDY	Last week.
CASSIDY	You okay?
RANDY	Yeah, yeah. Feelin' much better.
CASSIDY	Good, good. What happened?
RANDY	It was while I was wrestling. I collapsed in the ring.
CASSIDY	Oh, man. That's terrible.
RANDY	Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Tell ya, though, it was a big hit with the fans. Promoter told me everybody was hanging around wondering if I was okay, they wound up buying up all of his T-shirts and shit. Whole merch table got cleaned out.
CASSIDY	That's funny.
RANDY	Doctor says I can't wrestle no more.
CASSIDY	Damn. What are you gonna do?
RANDY	I don't know. I don't know what to do. If I can't wrestle...
CASSIDY	It just happened. You don't have to figure everything out this second. Give yourself some time.
RANDY	Time's all I got. I just sit there all day...
CASSIDY	You really shouldn't be alone right now.
RANDY	That's why I came to see you.
CASSIDY	Randy...
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I feel bad what happened. But you and me... I can't go there.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	You should be with family now. You have a daughter, right? Where is she?
RANDY	We don't really get along too good.
CASSIDY	It doesn't matter. You need her.
RANDY	She don't need me.
CASSIDY	Everybody needs a father. Trust me.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	You take care of yourself. You gonna be okay?
RANDY	I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken bigger bumps than this.
CASSIDY	I'm sure.
RANDY	Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.
CASSIDY	You should.
RANDY	Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A person only gets one father in this life.
CASSIDY	Exactly.
RANDY	Unless you're adopted.
CASSIDY	You're gonna be just fine.
RANDY	Definitely.
STEPHANIE'S VOICE	This is Stephanie, you know what to do.
RANDY	Hey... Is Stephanie home?
THE WOMAN	Who can I say it is?
RANDY	Her father.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Where you going? Stephanie!
STEPHANIE	What do you want?
RANDY	Can we talk?
STEPHANIE	Now's really not a good time.
RANDY	Wait! Where ya going?
RANDY (CONT'D)	You in school? That's great.
RANDY (CONT'D)	What school? What school?
STEPHANIE	Middlesex County Community.
RANDY	Middlesex? That's kind of a hike. Where's your car? You taking the bus? Lemme give you a lift.
STEPHANIE	That's okay.
RANDY	It's no problem. Really. I'm parked right by.
RANDY (CONT'D)	You're walking pretty fast there. You running late? I could help you with that. Give you a ride.
RANDY (CONT'D)	New Jersey Transit sucks!
RANDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)	The buses smell like piss!
STEPHANIE	Left at the second stop sign.
RANDY	Yes, ma'am!
STEPHANIE	You gonna talk?
RANDY	There's something I wanted to tell you.
STEPHANIE	Okay...
RANDY	I had a heart attack. Last week.
RANDY (CONT'D)	I wanna try to fix things.
STEPHANIE	You are such an asshole.
RANDY	Why?
STEPHANIE	Now you wanna fix things. Now that suddenly you're all scared and alone from your heart attack.
RANDY	What? No. It's not like----
STEPHANIE	This is so fuckin' you. You only come around when you need something from somebody, when they can do something for you. Selfish fuck. Good. Be alone.
RANDY	What are you doing?
RANDY (CONT'D)	Stephanie!
SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)	Didn't think I'd see you here.
RANDY	Why not?
SCOTT BRUMBERG	Heard you collapsed at the DiFusco show. Sounded pretty scary.
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)	What?
RANDY	Sold the shit outta that one.
SCOTT BRUMBERG	No way!
RANDY	I gotta give credit. DiFusco came up with the idea. We're setting up an angle for a grudge match.
SCOTT BRUMBERG	Wow... Dude, you are good.
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)	I was sure I'd have to cancel the minivan.
RANDY	What minivan?
SCOTT BRUMBERG	The one I rented for Fanfest.
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)	Me and a whole gang's driving down. Terry C., Caggiano, Fatback... I am so fuckin' psyched. You see the flyer?
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)	Volpe gave me an assload to pass out.
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)	That is gonna be epic.
NICK VOLPE PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS	"LEGENDS OF THE RING" FANFEST N A 20TH ANNIVERSARY REMATCH OF THEIR LEGENDERY EPIC DDIE RUCKUS, THE MORTICIAN, DEAN "THE DREAM" GIGUNDA,
RANDY	Looks great.
SCOTT BRUMBERG	Should get a pretty good crowd today.
RANDY	I'll start loosening up.
FAN	Thanks.
RANDY	You got it, broski.
SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)	Sorry, man.
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)	I was sure the turnout'd be bigger.
CASSIDY	Would you like a lapdance, sweetie?
CUSTOMER	That's okay.
CASSIDY	Would you like a lapdance?
GUY #1	Not right now.
GUY #2	I'm good. Hey.
CASSIDY	Hey. How ya feeling?
RANDY	Better. Good.
CASSIDY	How'd it go with your daughter?
RANDY	Good. Fine.
CASSIDY	Yeah?
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	You sure?
RANDY	Not too good, actually. She tore me a new asshole.
CASSIDY	Shit. That sucks.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	It's tough. You can't give up. You gotta keep trying.
RANDY	I was thinking about maybe getting her a present.
CASSIDY	That's a great idea! What's she into?
RANDY	I'm not sure.
CASSIDY	How old is she?
RANDY	
CASSIDY	What kind of music does she like?
RANDY	I don't know.
CASSIDY	Is she into books? Cooking?
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	How could you not know? She's your daughter.
RANDY	I'm a shitty fuckin' father.
CASSIDY	She's 22? Okay... You should get her some clothes, some kinda clothes... All girls like that.
RANDY	That could work.
CASSIDY	I know the perfect place. This kick- ass little vintage shop in Westfield.
RANDY	Yeah?
CASSIDY	Saturday's the best time to go. That's when they get the new stuff in, all these boxes full of great shit.
RANDY	Okay. Cool.
CASSIDY	I'll write it down.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I'm pretty sure it's on 28.
RANDY	Good tip. Thanks.
CASSIDY	You got it.
RANDY	I'm gonna grab a drink at the bar.
RANDY (CONT'D)	That was fast.
CASSIDY	Listen...
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	How `bout I meet you there Saturday? Help you out.
RANDY	Yeah? I'm actually gonna be running around right in that area anyway, so it's not really a pain.
RANDY	All right. Thanks.
CASSIDY	No problem. You got it.
WAYNE (O.S.)	Yeah?
RANDY	Hey, Wayne. Got a sec?
WAYNE	Not really. What?
RANDY	I was wondering if you had something more steady. Full-time.
WAYNE	Only thing I got right now's got weekends.
RANDY	That works.
WAYNE	Isn't that when you sit on other dudes' faces?
RANDY	What is it?
WAYNE	Deli counter.
RANDY	So, like, working with customers?
WAYNE	All day long, hot horny housewives begging for your meat. And prepared salads.
RANDY	That's the only thing you got?
WAYNE	At the moment. You interested?
CASSIDY (O.S.)	Hey.
RANDY	Hey.
RANDY (CONT'D)	I almost didn't recognize you. You look all... clean.
CASSIDY	"Clean"?
RANDY	Like classy.
CASSIDY	Gee, thanks.
RANDY	Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I like it. It's like in "Grease", where she turns into the hot rock `n' roll chick at the end. Except backwards.
CASSIDY	Oh-kaay...
RANDY	So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy or Pam?
CASSIDY	Pam. But don't get used to it.
RANDY	This is awesome... We are gonna find something great!
CASSIDY	Do you know her size?
RANDY	She's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you.
CASSIDY	Could you see her in this?
RANDY	Maybe. Not really. I'm not sure.
CASSIDY	What about this?
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	So like, what is she? Goth? Punk? Hippie? Preppy? Stoner?
RANDY	Not really...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Hey, Pam?
CASSIDY	Yeah?
RANDY	Thank you very much.
CASSIDY	You're welcome.
RANDY	I think she might be a lesbian.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Does that help?
RANDY	Ah, maybe she's just a friend.
RANDY (CONT'D)	What's that? The green.
CASSIDY	This?
RANDY	It's perfect.
CASSIDY	I agree.
RANDY	Thanks again.
CASSIDY	You found it.
RANDY	I never woulda known about this place.
CASSIDY	Okay, I'll give you that.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Look, I...
RANDY	Man, I worked up a pretty good thirst in there. What say we grab a beer?
CASSIDY	I gotta get going.
RANDY	One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
CASSIDY	I really can't. I got a kid at home.
RANDY	You have a kid?
RANDY (CONT'D)	I had no idea.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Boy or girl?
CASSIDY	Boy. Daniel.
RANDY	How old?
CASSIDY	Nine.
RANDY	Wow... I had no friggin' idea.
CASSIDY	It's not something I usually tell customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
RANDY	Wait.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Now both our kids got something.
RANDY (CONT'D)	You're gonna turn this down, too? Man, you're rough!
CASSIDY	That's very nice of you. Thank you.
RANDY	Tell him to take good care of that. $300 bucks on eBay.
CASSIDY	Really?
RANDY	Nah.
CASSIDY	One beer.
RANDY	He's a good-lookin' kid.
CASSIDY	I think so.
RANDY	I see where he gets it from.
CASSIDY	He sure doesn't get it from his douchebag father.
RANDY	What's that?
CASSIDY	Just this condo thing, down by Trenton.
RANDY	You moving there?
CASSIDY	Working on it. It's a great area. Way cheaper. And the schools are awesome.
RANDY	What about Cheetah's?
CASSIDY	I'm done. I'm quitting.
RANDY	Oh. Okay...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Hell, yeah.
RANDY (CONT'D)	C'mon. Let's dance.
CASSIDY	Where?
RANDY	Right here.
CASSIDY	This isn't a dance place.
RANDY	Who cares? Fuckin' Def Lep!
CASSIDY	I've danced to this plenty.
RANDY	Fine. Then I'm dancing for you.
CASSIDY	Is this a lapdance I'm getting?
RANDY	Just sit back and enjoy.
RANDY (CONT'D)	The lapdancer has become the lapdanced.

RANDY	Fuckin' mopey douchebag. "Ooh, look at me! I wear flannel! I'm all depressed!"
CASSIDY	"I'm from Seattle! I like rain!"
RANDY	Nineties fuckin' sucked.

RANDY	I thought it was gonna say Randy.
WAYNE	Guess they got it off your W-4.
RANDY	Do I really even need to wear one?
WAYNE	Are you gonna be interacting with our valued Shop-Rite customers?
RANDY	Yeah, but I----
WAYNE	Then yes.
RANDY	Could they maybe re-do it?
WAYNE	Just wear the fucking thing.
RANDY	Seventeen.
WOMAN	The Hudson Acres, are they all on sale or just the regular?
WOMAN (CONT'D)	It's a little unclear.
WOMAN (CONT'D)	I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if it's full price...
RANDY	Hang on, let me...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Wayne, please come to the deli counter.
RANDY (CONT'D)	It'll just be a minute.
WOMAN	Which in your opinion is the best smoked ham?
RANDY	I guess it depends what you like.
WOMAN	I tried the Apple Valley Farms once, and it was very salty. Do you find that?
RANDY	Forty-six.
WORKOUT WOMAN	Could I get a half-pound of the pesto pasta salad?
RANDY	Sure.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Pesto change-o.

RANDY	Well, I ain't a stalker. But...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Open it.
RANDY (CONT'D)	The "S" is for "Stephanie".
STEPHANIE	Oh. Okay.
RANDY	I got it just for you.
STEPHANIE	I see that. What's it for?
RANDY	No reason. Just because. Do you like it?
STEPHANIE	I do. It's... shiny.
RANDY	I was looking in this store and saw it, and I just said, "That is it." So what are you doing now?
STEPHANIE	What am I doing?
RANDY	Got any time? I was thinking we could swing by our old favorite spot.
STEPHANIE	We have an old favorite spot?
RANDY	You'll remember when you see. Whaddaya say?
STEPHANIE	Now's not the best time. I've got some things to do.
RANDY	What kinda things?
STEPHANIE	Stuff.
RANDY	You ain't got stuff! C'mon, give an old man a break.
RANDY	You really don't remember?
STEPHANIE	No.
RANDY	Guess you were pretty young.
RANDY (CONT'D)	There used to be this funhouse. The Monster Motel...
RANDY (CONT'D)	They had this cheesy-ass skeleton that popped out of a coffin. You'd get so scared, you'd cry. Then you'd beg to go in again.
STEPHANIE	Always was a glutton for punishment.
RANDY	You'd hop on my foot and wrap your arms around my leg. I'd have to walk you the whole way through like that.
STEPHANIE	I totally don't remember.
RANDY	I do.
RANDY	I accept your apology.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Not like that. I just mean... You made amends. I free you.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Anything you've ever done or said or thought, I forgive. You've done nothing wrong to me. And anything I've ever done... I'm sorry. Truly.
STEPHANIE	Thank you.
RANDY	I was young. My career was booming. All those lights, the fans, the crazy shit on the road... I wasn't thinking about my kid. Or my wife.
RANDY (CONT'D)	My priorities were all fucked up. I know that. But now... I wanna try to make things right. I wanna try to get to know you. I just hope it's not too late.
RANDY	Hope that wasn't too painful.
STEPHANIE	It was okay.
RANDY	Well...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Bye.
STEPHANIE	Bye.
RANDY	So... How about dinner sometime?
STEPHANIE	Dinner?
RANDY	Maybe Tuesday?
STEPHANIE	I'm sorry. I don't think so.
RANDY	Or not. That's cool, whatever...
STEPHANIE	Wednesday would work better.
RANDY	Yo, Miggy. Ram. How ya doin'? Good, good. Listen, you're gonna have to count me out for Utica. I'm retiring.
RANDY	Hey, how ya doin', Frank? Good, good. Listen...
RANDY	Sorry, Volp. You know I'd kill to do it. I realize. I understand. No more. I'm done. I'm retired. Positive. It's time to move on.
RANDY (O.S.)	Hey. Over here.
RANDY	Open it.
CASSIDY	I'll do it later when it's quiet.
RANDY	I wanna watch.
CASSIDY	That's very sweet. Thank you.
RANDY	Thank you. I couldn't've done it without you.
CASSIDY	I'm glad I could help.
RANDY	It was fun, right? We had a good time.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Shopping...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Hey, you ever been to Mother Kelly's?
CASSIDY	On 46?
RANDY	They got this kick-ass cover band Tuesday nights. Play anything you can think of. What do you say we----
CASSIDY	Randy.
RANDY	What?
CASSIDY	I can't do this.
RANDY	Do what?
CASSIDY	This.
RANDY	I thought we had a little something going here.
CASSIDY	I think you're awesome. You're a great guy.
RANDY	But...
CASSIDY	You think I'm, like, this stripper, but I'm not. I'm a mom, with responsibilities. I don't think you wanna get with that.
RANDY	What if I do?
CASSIDY	I can't go there.
RANDY	What about the other day?
CASSIDY	That was a mistake.
RANDY	Why? How?
CASSIDY	The club and the real world, they can't mix.
RANDY	What if we'd met someplace else?
CASSIDY	We didn't.
RANDY	But what if we did?
CASSIDY	We didn't.
RANDY	What if we did?
CASSIDY	We didn't.
RANDY	You say I don't know you, but you won't let me get to know you.
CASSIDY	You're a customer. You're just a fucking customer. That's it. Okay? Got it?
RANDY	Yeah. I got it.
CASSIDY	What's that for?
RANDY	A lapdance.
RANDY (CONT'D)	You're refusing a customer?
RANDY (CONT'D)	Gimme a lapdance.
RANDY (CONT'D)	What? Am I a customer or not?
CASSIDY	Stop it.
RANDY	What's the matter? Not in the mood? So fake it. I'm just a stupid customer.
CASSIDY	Stop.
RANDY	It doesn't mean anything.
RANDY (CONT'D)	C'mon, give the customer a lapdance. Shake your tits. Smile.
CASSIDY	Fuck off.
RANDY	Pretend you like him.
CASSIDY	Fuck off.
RANDY	I want a lapdance.
RANDY (CONT'D)	I WANT A LAPDANCE!

CUSTOMER (CONT'D)	Randy The Ram?
RANDY	Huh?

CUSTOMER (CONT'D)	Ram Jam!
CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Wow, that's freaky. You look just like the dude. Except older. Guns! And! Roses!... Guns! And! Roses!...
RANDY	What's that?
RANDY (CONT'D)	Folks, we are ready to rumble...
RANDY (CONT'D)	I've never seen such determination!
RANDY (CONT'D)	Sleeper claw!
RANDY (CONT'D)	Piledriver! Just listen to this place!
RANDY (CONT'D)	Powerbomb!
GUNS `N' ROSES	Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring!
RANDY	Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring!
SCOTT BRUMBERG	Ram!
RANDY	Yo, Brummy.
SCOTT BRUMBERG	How's tricks? Good to see ya, man.
RANDY	Yeah, good, good.
SCOTT BRUMBERG	So what brings ya by?
RANDY	Well... I was thinking about maybe doing a reffing gig.
SCOTT BRUMBERG	I thought you're retired.
RANDY	No wrestling, just reffing. Thought it might be fun. Shits `n' giggles.
SCOTT BRUMBERG	See what we got...
BOOKER D (O.S.)	Randy The Ref!
RANDY	`Sup, bro?
BOOKER D	Me and McPride was going over spots. We got this dope idea how to work you in.
RANDY	I really ain't lookin' to mix it up tonight.
BOOKER D	You're gonna love this. Check it out. So McPride----
RANDY	That's okay. You guys do your thing.
RANDY	One!... Two!...
BOOKER D	What a screwjob.
SHAWN MCPRIDE	Crowd was pissed.
SHAWN MCPRIDE (CONT'D)	The master.
BOOKER D	Just reffing, my ass. I knew you'd get in there.
SHAWN MCPRIDE	Y'all feel like grabbing a drink?
RANDY	By the time Ruckus fixes the tire, we've had so many Nyquil coladas we don't even realize we missed the damn gig!
RANDY (CONT'D)	Swear to God. Can't make stuff like that up.
BOOKER D	Yo, tell McPride shit-pit!
SHAWN MCPRIDE	Shit pit?
RANDY	You never heard that one?
RANDY (CONT'D)	Oh, man, fuckin' classic. 1990. Nashville Coliseum, Rage In The Cage II. I'm in the locker room door opens. I turn and there's Chris Columbo on the can taking a dump. He goes, "This is for Petrov", fuckin' wipes his ass, takes the shit-covered toilet paper and rubs it in his armpit. Five minutes later, he's in the ring with Petrov in a headlock, poor Petrov stuck there in CC's pit lookin' like he's gonna puke!
BOOKER D	Fuckin' classic. Uh-oh...
BOOKER D (CONT'D)	Ring rats, 12 o'clock.
ALYSSA	I know who you are.
ALYSSA (CONT'D)	My brother used to have your poster on his door.
RANDY	Dude's got taste.
Alyssa notices something intriguing over Randy's shoulder.	
RANDY (CONT'D)	Who's that?
ALYSSA	A.J. My old coke dealer.
ALYSSA (CONT'D)	I don't do that anymore.
RANDY	Me neither.
ALYSSA	Oh, Gawddd...
WOMAN (O.S.)	Could you please fuck someplace else? I gotta piss.
ROOMMATE	Alyssa's in the shower.
RANDY	Hey.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Is Stephanie home?
THE FRIEND	You don't have to go out there. You don't owe him shit.
STEPHANIE	I know that.
THE FRIEND	Then why would you even---- Who said you could come in?
STEPHANIE	Please leave my house.
RANDY	I'm so, so sorry. I completely, TOTALLY----
THE FRIEND	Get the fuck out of here!
STEPHANIE	I can handle this.
THE FRIEND	Obviously not.
STEPHANIE	I can handle this, Jen.
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	You're such a fucking asshole.
RANDY	I feel horrible.
STEPHANIE	I waited in that restaurant two hours. Two fucking hours. Just in case you showed up late. "Maybe he got stuck in traffic. Maybe I got the time wrong"... Nope.
RANDY	I know I fucked up. I fucked up bad.
STEPHANIE	You didn't fuck up. You are a fuck- up. A walking, living, breathing fuck-up.
RANDY	I'm trying to change. Really. I can't stand when I----
STEPHANIE	Just please shut the fuck up. Because I can't even stand the sound of your voice.
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	I thought about having a drink for the first time in 11 months last night. That's what you do to me. You asshole!
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	Fucking piece-of-shit asshole!
RANDY	Jesus! Stop!
STEPHANIE	Get off me!
RANDY	Calm down!
STEPHANIE	GET THE FUCK OFF ME!
RANDY	Calm down!
STEPHANIE	I HATE YOU!
RANDY	You don't mean that!
STEPHANIE	FUCKING HATE YOU!
RANDY	YOU DON'T MEAN IT!
STEPHANIE	I don't mean it? You're right. I don't.
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	I don't know why I got so hysterical. There's no reason. I don't hate you. I don't love you. I don't like you. I was stupid to think you could change.
RANDY	I can change.
STEPHANIE	I don't care.
RANDY	I know I can.
STEPHANIE	Doesn't matter. I don't care. I'm done. No more fixing it. It's broke. Permanently. I'm cool with it. It's better that way.
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	I don't want to ever see you again. I don't wanna see you, I don't want to hear you... Done. You understand? Actually, I don't care if you understand.
STEPHANIE (CONT'D)	Goodbye.
STEPHANIE	You can come home. He's gone.
WAYNE	Let's pick it up. Rush hour.
CUSTOMER #1 (O.S.) CUSTOMER #2 (O.S.)	
WAYNE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Randy!
WAYNE (CONT'D)	Let's get that patched up.
RANDY	Let's get it onnn!

RANDY	Nick. Randy The Ram... I wanna do it. Fanfest. I know, but I want back in. So call Bob, get the match back on. Pay me? Don't worry. Just cover my expenses. And pay Bob. Make sure he's there. I don't give a shit. I just wanna wrestle.
CASSIDY	Hi.
RANDY	How'd you find me?
CASSIDY	Big Chris. Cheetah's bouncer.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Look, I'm sorry if I came off like a bitch. I didn't mean that stuff I said. You're not just a customer.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I'm sure it seems retarded, but I gotta keep that line. It's how I've been able to live with myself the last 12 years.
CASSIDY	There's a place I'm trying to get to in my life. For me and my son.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	I'm leaving that world behind. And I can't bring anybody with me who----
RANDY	Good for you. Quitting's hard.
CASSIDY	Where are you going?
RANDY	Got a match.
RANDY (CONT'D)	See ya later.
CASSIDY	In bed by 11. Don't let him bargain.
CASSIDY	Bye, monkey... Cassidy----where ya goin', baby?
CLUB D.J. (O.S.)	Pam.
CASSIDY	Pam.
STEPHANIE'S VOICE	This is Stephanie, you know what to do.
RANDY	It's me. I promise I won't call you ever again. I'm going back to the ring. You were right about me. Everything you said. Anyway... I just wanted you to know... Your daddy loves you. That's all.
CASSIDY	There's waffles in the freezer and some burritos if he wants for lunch. He knows where. I'm not sure what time I'll be headed back yet. I'll keep you posted as I go.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Yeah, nah, business is rockin'. Just opened a third dealership.
THE AYATOLLAH	That makes two in Columbus, one in Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say Cincy's not out of the question.
OTHER WRESTLER	Wow...
THE AYATOLLAH	Ram-A-Lam.
RANDY	What's up, Bob? Yo, Carl.
THE AYATOLLAH	Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think we were gonna do this.
RANDY	Yeah, well, I'm here.
THE AYATOLLAH	Thursday night, I get a call, "It's on! He's back in!" I'm like "What?"
RANDY	When you get settled in, we should go over things.
THE AYATOLLAH	What things?
RANDY	Y'know, the spots.
THE AYATOLLAH	Ah, we can just wing it.
RANDY	You don't wanna hash it out?
THE AYATOLLAH	It'll be fine.
RANDY	We should have at least a basic plan.
THE AYATOLLAH	How's this: I'm the heel, you're the face. Done.
THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)	Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio, swing on by. I'll make you a nice deal on a G6.
CASSIDY	Excuse me.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)	Do you know where the Civic Auditorium is?
RANDY	Ready to do this?
THE AYATOLLAH	Believe so.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	From the Islamic Republic of Iran, weighing in at 252 pounds... The Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The Middle East... The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah!
CASSIDY	Excuse me.
THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)	Death to America!
CASSIDY (O.S.)	Randy.
RANDY	What are you doing here?
CASSIDY	Don't do this. This is dumb.
RANDY	This ain't the best time to talk.
RANDY (CONT'D)	What about your heart?
RANDY (CONT'D)	I'll be fine.
CASSIDY	I thought the doctor...
RANDY	They always say that. Whatever you got.
CASSIDY	You could really hurt yourself. I know what I'm doing in there. Out here's where I get hurt.
CASSIDY	Out here's what counts. The real world.
RANDY	Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a shit about me in the real world.
CASSIDY	I quit my job, drove 14 hours through the night to get here. What do you call that?
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	And his opponent...
RANDY	Listen to them! This is where I'm great. This is where I belong.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	From Elizabeth, New Jersey, weighing in at 219 pounds...
RANDY	I gotta go.
CASSIDY	Randy. Please.
RANDY	I'll see you after the show.
CASSIDY	No.
RANDY	Enjoy the show.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	A true wrestling immortal, one of the greatest of all time... Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn!
COMMENTATOR #1	There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!
COMMENTATOR #2	History about to be made here at the Greenville Civic Auditorium.
RANDY	I just got one thing to say to you people...
RANDY (CONT'D)	Thank you.
RANDY (CONT'D)	You take your lumps and bruises in this game. But you know what? It's all worth it. Because of you guys. Your cheers keep me young. They make me feel alive. In 1982, the year I wrestled my first professional match, I was six- foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot- eleven. Three back surgeries in 11 years knocked two full inches off my height. I may be down to five- eleven, but performing in front of you people has always made me feel 10 feet tall. And that's the way it's always gonna be.
RANDY (CONT'D)	Forever. You're workin' pretty light here.
THE AYATOLLAH	Jesus. Relax.
REFEREE	One!... Two!...
RANDY	Anytime you wanna join in.
THE AYATOLLAH	That better?
RANDY	Much.
THE AYATOLLAH	Forgot how much fun this is.
REFEREE	One!... Two!...
FAN #1 (O.S.) FAN #2 (O.S.)	Camelfucker! Fat piece of shit!
THE AYATOLLAH	Pathetic. Pitiful godless infidel!
CASSIDY	Randy!
THE AYATOLLAH	Wanna take it home?
CASSIDY	Stop it! Stop it, Randy!
RANDY	It's time.
THE AYATOLLAH	All you, bro. Lead the way.
COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)	Dropkick! And another! And another! Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!... Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)	Just listen to this crowd!
THE AYATOLLAH	If you ain't up to it... Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
RANDY	Let's do this.
COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)	Lateral drop!
CROWD (O.S.)	Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
THE AYATOLLAH	Y'okay?
THE AYATOLLAH (CONT'D)	Just pin me.
CROWD (O.S.)	RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)	Finish it. Pin me.
COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)	Uh-oh, the horns are out...
COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)	Here we go...
