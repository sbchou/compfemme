CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
HANNA	I just missed your heart. She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist She fires two shots directly at CAMERA. Remove the penis and scrotum, make a deep, circular cut around the rectum. HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket. Cut from the rear to the brisket. She works calmly without expression. She freezes, sensing danger. Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands
ERIK	You're dead. Right now. I've killed you. HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She
ERIK (CONT'D)	Use your hands! She goes for the gun again and again he stops her. HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground. He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow. He plods into the forest.
ERIK (CONT'D)	Drag it back yourself. HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a
ERIK	What's wrong? Are you hurt? She keeps swirling her spoon.
ERIK (CONT'D)	You were half asleep.
HANNA	I'll do better next time.
ERIK	German.
HANNA	I'll do better next time.
ERIK	Italian.
HANNA	I'll do better next time.
ERIK	Spanish. HANNA studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful. Spanish.
HANNA	Did you really want me to snap your neck? He looks at her - drops the quiz.
ERIK	How much did you pull off the deer?
HANNA	A hundred and twenty with scraps.
ERIK	About 200 pounds in total? HANNA nods.
ERIK (CONT'D)	That explains it.
HANNA	What?
ERIK	How you beat me. You're getting strong. HANNA almost blushes. ERIK stands to put his bowl away.
ERIK (CONT'D)	I'm glad you didn't snap my neck.
ERIK	The Great Blue Whale is the largest animal to have ever existed. A blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons and its mouth is large enough to hold 90 tons of food and water.
HANNA	How much is that?
ERIK	It's bigger than the cabin. Its heart weighs thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles. HANNA smirks.
ERIK (CONT'D)	The Blue Whale's "music" can be heard for over 500 miles. He shuts the book.
ERIK (CONT'D)	Time for sleep.
HANNA	Good night. He stands by her bed looking down at her.
ERIK	Did you forget something?
HANNA	No. ERIK takes HANNA'S gun out of his pocket and puts it on the
HANNA (CONT'D)	Sorry.
ERIK	Good night. He walks to the door. HANNA stops him with a question.
HANNA	What's music like?
ERIK	It's difficult to explain.
HANNA	Try. He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and âMusic. A combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion'.
HANNA	But how does it feel? Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions.
ERIK	Good. It feels good. It's, uh, nice.
HANNA	Tell me properly. Can you play music?
ERIK	Your mother could. She used to sing very well.
HANNA	I'd like to hear it for myself.
ERIK	You will soon enough.
HANNA	How soon? Erik looks away from her questioning eyes.
ERIK	When you're ready.
HANNA	I'm ready. I'm ready already. They look at each other- he weighs it up.
ERIK	Just go to sleep now. I'll see you in the morning. Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a wattle HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires.
ERIK	Again. They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.
ERIK (CONT'D)	Again. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give
HANNA	I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I have a dog called Trudi.
ERIK	Don't give up! Don't give up! HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she
HANNA	I didn't need your help. Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares ERIK enters the room. ERIK approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and
HANNA	I'm ready now.
ERIK	Maybe. ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat. He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint
ERIK (CONT'D)	You didn't tell me you had a knife.
HANNA	You told me to think for myself. Isn't that what you want? She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just
HANNA (CONT'D)	I want to see things. I can't stay here forever.
ERIK	One, two, three, four... ...five, six, seven, eight...
ERIK	...nine, ten. After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.
HANNA	Hello little foxy... foxy loxy... come on... come and share my breakfast. The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap, As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up, An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S
HANNA	Did you see it? Wasn't it beautiful, like thunder. I had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud. Did you hear it? She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.
HANNA (CONT'D)	What's wrong? Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen What does it do?
ERIK	It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are. He looks at her, a hint of a challenge.
ERIK (CONT'D)	When you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch. She approaches the box and places a single finger on the
ERIK (CONT'D)	But once it's done, there'll be no going back. She'll never give up until you're dead, or she is. You understand? I wont be there to hold your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's what you really want.
HANNA	You're not scaring me. He looks at her disbelievingly. She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away He softens towards her.
ERIK	It's here. There's no rush. Take your time. HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking
ERIK	Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957. Scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die.
HANNA	That's sad. ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.
ERIK	explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars. HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that
ERIK	Will you hunt with me? Hanna is sweeping the ground.
HANNA	If you want.
ERIK	It's up to you.
HANNA	Me?
ERIK	Yes. HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her.
HANNA	I'll stay.
ERIK	Fine. ERIK leaves abruptly. HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her
HANNA	Marissa Wiegler. HANNA approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her Come and find me. CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red light begins to An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to - She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in
ERIK	You were lucky to grab that deer. There was nothing out there today. ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing.
ERIK (CONT'D)	Smells good. He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and
MARISSA WIEGLER.	Her young male PA and TECH ONE are already waiting for her.
TECH ONE	Ma'am. We've had a signal reported by Interpol. We think it's Eric Heller. An unusual expression of shock on MARISSA'S face.
MARISSA	Well I'll be.
TECH ONE	It seems he's in Sweden. Jokkmokk. 40 miles out.
MARISSA	What the fuck is he doing there?
TECH ONE	Living in the middle of nowhere, like the frigging Una Bomber.
MARISSA	The son of a bitch. Sweden? Sweden?! The PA hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.
TECH ONE	Apparently he turned on his locator.
MARISSA	He's not an idiot.
TECH ONE	I know... I mean I believe so. But that's what happened.
MARISSA	After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe he'd rather go to prison.
MARISSA (V.O.)	Eric Heller. From the Czech Republic. I recruited him in 1991 when they were all joining the Velvet Revolution and sticking it to the commies ERIK, now clean shaven, opens a wooden case in the corner of
MARISSA (V.O.)	He couldn't wait to kiss some yankee butt and make some bucks doing our dirty work. ERIK awkwardly begins to change into the suit.
MARISSA	Trouble was he had his own way of doing things. Kinda paranoid. WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He uses an
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Not a team player. Not a âjoiner.â He became increasingly isolated and disturbed. Kept mouthing off about classified programmes. WALT clicks on a link to a newspaper article which comes on
MARISSA (CONT'D)	I kept warning and he kept getting worse. In the summer of 1995 he took his girlfriend, Johanna Zadek, on a trip to the Baltic coast and blew her head off. WALT hits a new link: A still of the same young woman as the
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Never heard from him again.
BOB	Anybody know why? Maybe the pressure got to him, Bob. You know what that's like. A MALE VOICE comes from the speaker, this is LEWIS but we What do you want us to do?
MARISSA	Bring him in.
WALT	What do you mean? Call the police,
MARISSA	- Walt. This is exactly the kind of shit we can't have out there anymore. He was one of ours, we trained him. He kills some other poor woman and it's a cluster fuck.
WALT	Tell it to Interpol. Let them pick him up. Try him for murder.
BOB	He's right. This has nothing to do with us. I don't understand.
MARISSA	You don't have to. I'm making the call. BOB and WALT exchange a look.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Thank you, Gentlemen. That'll be all. The video screen flickers off, people take their files and
ERIK	Hanna... HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear.
ERIK (CONT'D)	Tell me again?
HANNA	Marissa Weigler.
ERIK	Then?
HANNA	Postcard.
ERIK	Then?
HANNA	What?
ERIK	The address where we meet.
HANNA	Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin. Germany. ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks
ERIK	Good night my sweet girl. He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops
HANNA	Father... He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation.
ERIK	You can do this. You're ready. Just remember what I've taught you. She smiles reassuringly at him.
HANNA	I'll see you there. She watches as ERIK walks away from the cabin for the last Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US
SPECIAL OPS	Is this guy one of ours?
HEAD OF OPS	Used to be. Tread carefully, he's been in there a long time, he's damaged goods, and he knows we're coming. We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the She silently springs to her feet and moves to the front of She looks out and sees shadows moving among the trees. The rest of the forces wait in silence for a radio signal.
HEAD OF OPS	McCullum? Do you read me? No response.
HEAD OF OPS (CONT'D)	I repeat, do you read me? The HEAD of OPS waves all thirty of his men closer to the The HEAD of OPS and five other men storm the cabin.
MARISSA	What is it? Ma'am, this is Lewis. MARISSA affects a âbusiness as usualâ tone.
MARISSA	Go ahead. The target escaped.
MARISSA	How did that happen?
LEWIS (V.O.)	We're thinking maybe he got away in the snow, in the thick snow, or... But he's in the wind and I have two men down. Find him, Lewis. Find him and take him out.
LEWIS	Ma'am. There's more. They found a child, his daughter. MARISSA turns pale. A cement box. HANNA lies on a small bed. Not moving. Two
VOICE 1	She hasn't moved since we brought her in.
VOICE 2 (BURTON)	Has anyone talked to her?
VOICE 1	They want a psych evaluation before they interrogate.
BURTON	Hello Hanna. Hanna lies motionless.
BURTON (CONT'D)	My name is Dr. Burton. Would you like to talk to me? BURTON'S voice has been trained to engender a state of peace
HANNA	I was told by my father to gain the upper hand.
BURTON	Really. Interesting. What else did your father tell you?
HANNA	Where am I?
BURTON	You're in holding.
HANNA	I see.
BURTON	This must all be very strange for you. You've been in the forest a long time. But I want you to know no one's going to hurt you. We just want to talk to you about your father. HANNA seems to be staring up at the ceiling.
BURTON (CONT'D)	Hanna? He follows her eye-line to the CCTV camera above them.
HANNA	Is that a camera?
BURTON	Ah, yes, that's a camera. To keep a record.
HANNA	Camera obscura, it's Latin for "dark chamber".
LEWIS	Plug the CCTV through to Langley. Extension 247. MONITOR presses some buttons as LEWIS calls on his phone and
LEWIS (CONT'D)	You should have visual on the psych evaluation now.
HANNA	It was first described by the Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021.
MARISSA	What's she saying?
LEWIS (O.S.)	Gobbledygook.
BURTON	Can I get you something? What do you like? Music? Magazines? Just say. Anything at all.
HANNA	I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.
LEWIS (O.S.)	Did you hear that? MARISSA pauses before she answers.
MARISSA	Tell her I'll be there tonight.
LEWIS	But...
MARISSA	Just do it.
MILITARY DOCTOR 1	John come and take a look at this kid's blood sample. MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across. He sees the sample on the
MILITARY DOCTOR 2.	Is that right? That can't be right.
MILITARY DOCTOR 1	And I got a sample of her hair. MILITARY DOCTOR 2 looks at the results, baffled.
MILITARY DOCTOR 2	That must be contamination. What contamination? What would it be?
MILITARY DOCTOR 2	Run it again. A pair of smart female shoes enter the room, accompanied by
FALSE MARISSA (O.C.)	My name is Marissa Wiegler. You wanted to speak to me? HANNA turns to look. It is a completely different woman, dressed in similar HANNA stares at her, then looks at the two guards.
FALSE MARISSA (CONT'D)	You can wait outside. The guards exit and the door slams shut behind them.
LEWIS	You should have visual.
HANNA (V.O.)	Where am I?
FALSE MARISSA	You're in a safe place. Let's talk about your father. You must love him very much.
HANNA	Where did you meet him? The false MARISSA pauses.
MARISSA	Tell her it was by a news kiosk in Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. Say it was raining.
FALSE MARISSA	At a news kiosk. Alexanderplatz. In the rain. She smiles reassuringly. HANNA nods, looking at FALSE
LEWIS	Lewis.
MILITARY DOCTOR	Sir we need to talk to you. We've run tests on the girl. His voice sounds urgent, concerned. But Marissa has
MARISSA (V.O.)	What tests? As the argument continues, we see and hear on the screen the
FALSE MARISSA	Do you know where your father is? In the OBS room LEWIS, half watching the screen, explains to
LEWIS	Standard DNA and meds.
MARISSA	Send the results straight to me. On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA.
FALSE MARISSA	Did he tell you where he was going? We're all worried about him. On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE MARISSA. She begins to
MONITOR	Sir look. LEWIS looks at HANNA.
FALSE MARISSA	It's OK. It's OK. HANNA coils her thin arms around the FALSE MARISSA'S neck, The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly
BURTON (V.O.)	You want me to give her something?
FALSE MARISSA	I think it might be necessary.
MARISSA	Get her out of there.
BURTON	Open up. The first guard opens HANNA'S door.
LEWIS (V.O.)	Abort. I repeat. Abort.
LEWIS	Jee-sus wept! On another screen LEWIS watches as the other Guard tries to
LEWIS	She's a child for Christsake! HANNA walks fast along the corridor. She ducks into a door to
FEMALE GUARD	This is Sanders. I'm checking Zone eleven. The FEMALE GUARD radios off, then enters. She senses POV SANDERS - The DNA laboratory suddenly seems empty. The She turns around but HANNA has vanished into thin air, there The last pair of personnel start heading towards her. She She puts a foot on a rail, halls herself up towards the vent.
MONITOR	You think she's out?
LEWIS	She can't get out. LEWIS picks up an internal telephone. Who's on the perimeter? Detail every unit available. She summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest. She She hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out.
MILITARY VOICE (V.O.)	473 are you receiving me? Can you confirm your position. Subject has escaped.
MILITARY VOICE	Can you confirm your position 473? Banks? Banks can you hear me? Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a
BANKS.	I'm at a perimeter opening at the far east wing. Something's not quite right... He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air- As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle, The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune. MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters: A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward. Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal I live in Leipzig. German city... 0.7 Million people... I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium... literature and sport... I have a dog called Trudi. HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow
SOPHIE	Hello. HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
SOPHIE (CONT'D)	All right? HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)	Don't you speak English? HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)	That can't be helped. You look terrible. At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,
MILES	Who's she?
SOPHIE	I don't know. I just found her.
MILES	What's her name?
SOPHIE	She can't talk.
HANNA	Hanna.
MILES	She talked.
HANNA	I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. She's weird.
HANNA	I also have a dog called Trudi.
MILES	We had a dog called Vincent, but he went mad and died.
SOPHIE	I'm Sophie and this is my brother, Shit for Brains. From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S
RACHEL (O.S.)	Come on, Sophie! We'll miss the light. MILES raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture of
MILES	Bye.
SOPHIE	See you. SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to Do you need a lift somewhere?
HANNA	No. I prefer to walk.
SOPHIE	Suit yourself. SOPHIE and MILES head back towards their nouveau hippy
LEWIS(O.O.V)	She's in the desert east of Essouiara.
MARISSA	Have you got the DNA results?
LEWIS	We can't find them. It's possible she has them on her. Marissa takes that in.
MARISSA	Okay. I want you to focus on Erik Heller.
LEWIS (O.O.V)	Why? A sweet-faced male AIR STEWARD hovers over MARISSA.
AIR STEWARD	Excuse Madame, airline regulations state that -
MARISSA	I'm in conference.
AIR STEWARD	All the same -
MARISSA	Back off, honey. I'm busy. MARISSA'S response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD
LEWIS (O.O.V)	You know this isn't going to go away.
MARISSA	I'm dealing with it Lewis. Okay but I just want you to admit - my Lord - how did she know to ask for you? She hangs up. HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks, An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA HANNA sees MILES running through the crowds carrying a bag of She follows him a little way, onto a busy street with hotels He runs up the steps and enters a small mid-range hotel.
HOTEL OWNER	Where's your family?
HANNA	Are you Arab?
HOTEL OWNER	I'm Moroccan. Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira. Religion Islam. Language Arabic I like Arabic very much. It's like Japanese. It's big. The HOTEL OWNER nearly spits out his biscuit in shock.
HOTEL OWNER	You speak Arabic?
HANNA	Yes, of course.
HOTEL OWNER	Where's your family?
HANNA	I need a room for one night. Can you help? I don't have any money. They speak in Arabic with English subtitles.
HOTEL OWNER	It's the best we've got.
HANNA	Thank you. HANNA stares at the light switch. Do you have one of these in every room?
HOTEL OWNER	Of course. All mod cons.
HANNA	It's electricity? The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.
HOTEL OWNER	Yes.
HANNA	I know a little bit about electricity. They say Edison discovered it, or was it Franklin?
HOTEL OWNER	Some American, I'm sure. He picks up an electric kettle.
HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)	Electric kettle for the English - they like to make their own tea. He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily.
HANNA	What is it?
HOTEL OWNER	It's the best we can do. She stares at the picture, bemused.
HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)	Where do you come from? Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard.
HANNA	The forest. The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East, The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air A telephone beside the bed starts to ring. HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from
MILES	Look. It's that girl. He nudges SOPHIE. HANNA eyes them suspiciously.
SOPHIE	Hey you made it.
MILES	Hey, again.
SOPHIE	Did you walk here?
MILES	She looks different.
SOPHIE	Do you want to hang with us?
MILES	Are you hungry?
SOPHIE	Miles is always hungry.
HANNA	I'm thirsty.
LEWIS (O.S.)	The Swedish borders are sealed. I have Swedish, Norwegian and Danish border patrols on high alert and Interpol have briefed the police.
MARISSA	I don't want any bad news Lewis. Neither of us can afford a fuck up. MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.
ISAACS	I didn't think they let women in here.
MARISSA	They let them in, they just don't let them get dressed. He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Still drinking on the job. You haven't changed.
ISAACS	You have.
MARISSA	Adapt or die.
ISAACS	You want a drink?
MARISSA	I'll wait until I really need one. He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Erik Heller's still alive. ISAACS glances up from his drink.
ISAACS	You don't say.
MARISSA	There's more. MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is
ISAACS (IRONIC)	Wow. All grown up.
MARISSA	He did a good job.
ISAACS	Did she turn out like you hoped?
MARISSA	She just tried to kill me.
ISAACS	Isn't it always the way?
MARISSA	The fuck does that mean?
ISAACS	You bring them into this world, teach them how to kill and maim... and then they turn against you.
MARISSA	I didn't teach her.
ISAACS	No, it's better than that. You bred her from a test tube. MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the
MARISSA	Here's the problem: She thinks we killed her mother. He smiles wryly.
ISAACS	Just get her sectioned or something.
MARISSA	Sure, just as soon as she's done breaking peoples necks. You get her sectioned, if you can catch her. The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Right now she's in Morocco but she'll be trying to get out of the country. Find her and bring her to me. Quietly.
ISAACS	I'll need funds. MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table.
MARISSA	Don't spend it all on candy. She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some
SOPHIE	She's beautiful. I wish I had a body like hers. She's really cool too. She's married to a footballer and really loves him - Meanwhile HANNA eyes the crowd, constantly on the look out.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)	- only the papers found out he was shagging like loads of other girls so she went and got all successful in her own right and now does a make-over show where she turns right dogs into real babes. I could do you a make-over if you'd like?
RACHEL	Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a make- over, sweetie. SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to
SOPHIE	Rachel doesn't believe in making the best of yourself.
RACHEL	No Sophie, I just don't believe fourteen year-old girls should be dressing to look like porn stars. It objectifies them. Do you shave your armpits yet?
HANNA	I don't think so.
RACHEL	Good. Keep it that way.
SOPHIE	That's SOOO gross.
RACHEL	Do you often travel on your own, Hanna?
HANNA	My father encourages me to be independent.
SEB	And your mother?
HANNA	She's dead.
SEB	Oh, I'm sorry.
SOPHIE	Nice one, Dad.
HANNA	People die.
MILES	What did she die of?
HANNA	Three bullets.
RACHEL	Oh. God. How terrible. SOPHIE is weirdly impressed.
HELLER	Three pounds of goose fat if you please.
SOPHIE	Why do we always have to get up so early?
SEB	If you were a Berber shepherd -
SOPHIE	- I'm not a shepherd. Jesus.
RACHEL	We have to be at the port by eight tomorrow so I want you to pack now...
MILES	I'm too sleepy. HANNA listens anxiously, knowing she needs to go with them to She arrives at her door.
HANNA	Good night. But the family are too wrapped up in their discussion to
SEB	No, you're not. Come on we'll do it together. HANNA enters her room. SOPHIE turns at the sound of HANNA'S
SOPHIE	She's weird. Is it me, or is that girl weird? The test reads: HANNA HELLER - âSGM + test results.
RESULTÂ	HANNA stares at the words. âInterfering sequence present. What does it mean? She looks up at the TV and sees footage of millions of Muslim She listens in wonder to her first experience of music. Music. A combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion. She breathes in the beautiful sounds. A barren rocky outcrop on the South Swedish coast. HELLER Then HELLER starts to cover his body in the goose fat he When she finds it, she tries the doors but they're locked. She gets her hands in there and tries to prise it open She looks around the car park for an implement. The sun roof to the rear, above the breakfast table and bench
SEB	... Somebody broke the sun roof. I said somebody broke the sun roof. It won't close...
RACHEL	Call the rental.
SEB	I hope its insured. He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the
SEB	Typical. Get me back to the European Union.
RACHEL	Don't be rude. They get out, taking with them anything they might need - They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks. She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin,
RACHEL	What has got into you? Oh my God, look over there. They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.
SOPHIE	It's her.
SEB	You think she... you don't think she... Rachel, the sunroof?
RACHEL	You think we should say something?
SEB	What's there to say?
RACHEL	Maybe she's in trouble.
SEB	Maybe she's a hooker. Or a terrorist. There's a lot of them in Germany.
SOPHIE	Hookers or terrorists?
RACHEL	I'll go over.
SEB	Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting here. I'm putting my foot down... RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows. SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either
SOPHIE	All right?
HANNA	Did you know that 71 percent of the earths surface is covered in water?
SOPHIE	My father thinks you're a stowaway. He thinks you broke our sunroof too, which puts you in deep shit.
RACHEL	Sophie just - I'll handle this. Where's your father? No reply. I really think it might help if you told us the, you know, the truth and all that. Have you run away from somewhere?
SOPHIE	Are you okay?
HANNA	I'm fine.
RACHEL	I'm worried about you.
SOPHIE	She said she's fine.
RACHEL	You have to understand this really is a problem for us.
SOPHIE	You know what? Why don't I stay here with her and you go off and be with dad? He's looking kind of tense. RACHEL rejoins SEB and MILES.
SEB	Has she even got a passport?!
RACHEL	I don't think I handled that very well.
SEB	How do you know she's not some kind of illegal immigrant? A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.
SOPHIE	Would you like some? HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.
HANNA	Please. She tries it.
HANNA (CONT'D)	It tastes like music.
SOPHIE	You're so weird, aren't you? Did you have a fight with your dad or something?
HANNA	Yes.
SOPHIE	Was it bad?
HANNA	No. I won. HANNA studies the sea.
HANNA (CONT'D)	Can you help me get home? At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA You could do me a make-over if you like? Through the windscreen, RACHEL and SEB can be seen having a In the back, HANNA is changing into some of SOPHIE'S clothes.
SOPHIE	You're pretty. You know that?
HANNA	Am I?
SOPHIE	Of course you are. You've got pretty eyes and you're tall. I always wanted to be tall. If I were a man I might fancy you. She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.
HANNA	I'm not a man. SOPHIE laughs even more. The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL,
SEB	Okay, here's the deal. We're going to find a way to get you home just as soon as we get off this crate. But since you don't have a passport with you right now, we're just going to have to be a bit gorilla. Okay?
RACHEL	We passionately believe it's the right thing to do. They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round RACHEL is at the drivers wheel while SEB is in the back HANNA waits, breath bated, her arm round SOPHIE's shoulders. RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.
RACHEL	You okay honey?
HANNA	Yes yes I'm ready! ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry
SEB	Oh Jesus. HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in the box, helps SEB fling SEB grits his teeth.
SEB (CONT'D)	Here goes nothing. He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions
SEB (CONT'D)	Excuse me. Sir? ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He A POLICE CAR swings into the car park. He stops and turns towards the police car. Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE
ISAACS	Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we have a situation here...
LEWIS	The Danish authorities are taking this very seriously. They've doubled the number of officers on the ground. We've sent up spotter planes over the channel.
LEWIS (CONT'D)	They're appealing for witnesses through the local media... MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The
LEWIS (CONT'D)	You think he really swam it? MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she
MARISSA	Keep me posted.
GERMAN CAMPER.	Guten tag.
HANNA	Guten Morgen.
GERMAN CAMPER.	Wie geht es Ihnen?
HANNA	Gutm und Ihnen?
GERMAN CAMPER.	Jah, gut, gut... A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them.
FRENCH CAMPER.	Bonjour. Ca va?
HANNA	Ca va. Oui. Bien... HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.
RACHEL	Maybe we could all go for a walk when we've put the tent up.
SOPHIE	No thanks. HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he HANNA gets up and posts the card.
RACHEL	I just feel connected when I'm in the countryside. The city stifles me... emotionally, creatively. HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in
RACHEL (CONT'D)	Anyway, I was very young when I... Seb and I.... He was so impressive. HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.
RACHEL (CONT'D)	Hanna?!
SOPHIE	It's probably just a bunch of Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly going to be out all night.
RACHEL	You're not going, Sophie. No way, Jose. HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS.
HANNA	Food. SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and
MILES	That's gross.
SOPHIE	I don't know why I'm doing this, you're going to steal all the best men off of me.
HANNA	What do you mean?
SOPHIE	Though quite frankly I don't need more digits than I've got right now. Loads. Loads and loads. HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She
HANNA	It's like paint.
SOPHIE	Don't lick it off. SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)	You're gorgeous.
HANNA	I can't walk in this.
SOPHIE	You look hot.
HANNA	Where are we going?
SOPHIE	Shhhhh! HANNA uncomfortable with the situation.
HANNA	I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.
SOPHIE	Says who? SOPHIE heads off down the road. HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's
SOPHIE	Vodka. Two. The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of
BARTENDER	Water only. No booze. Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to
HANNA	What do they call this music?
SOPHIE	Banging. HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it - ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,
ISAACS	What you got?
DEALER	Nothing man. That guys just a friend. ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.
DEALER (CONT'D)	Hey, you're not police. What the fuck? ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips.
ISAACS	Ssh. Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple
SPANISH BOY	Where are you from? The girls just look at each other.
SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)	English? American? You like to party? They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and
HANNA	Will you teach me to do dancing?
SOPHIE	It's easy. HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing. He's after you.
HANNA	How can you tell?
SOPHIE	Duh, look at the way he's looking at you. He's gorgeous. FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking
FELICIANO'S FRIEND	What's your name?
SOPHIE	Sophie.
FELICIANO'S FRIEND	Have you come here before?
SOPHIE	All the time.
FELICIANO'S FRIEND	Really? You dance well.
SOPHIE	So do you. HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact. HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and The crowd is jumping. HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.
HANNA	Are we going to kiss now?
FELICIANO	Would you like to?
HANNA	Kissing requires a total of thirty- four facial muscles. Their lips are almost touching.
HANNA (CONT'D)	The most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle, which is used to pucker the lips - He kisses her. HANNA closes her eyes. ISAACS moves in. FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her HANNA snaps. In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws
SOPHIE	Hanna! Holy crap...
FELICIANO	Please, don't hurt me. Please, tell your friend... HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the
HANNA	Should I let him go?
SOPHIE	As opposed to what? Yes, you should let him go. HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.
HANNA	I'm going to go now.
FELICIANO	Sure.
HANNA	It was nice. And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd. HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the
SOPHIE	Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you were going to kill him. Where d'you learn to do that?
HANNA	My father taught me. They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence. An immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the
KATRIN	Who is it? No reply. KATRIN puts the safety chain across the door and
MARISSA	Hello Katrin. KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it. Thinking the apartment is secure, she tries to catch her She turns to face the intruder... MARISSA standing, waiting
KATRIN	You look different in pictures.
MARISSA	Well here I am in the flesh. KATRIN'S mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Has Erik Heller contacted you?
KATRIN	Erik's dead. MARISSA sits calmly in an old arm chair.
MARISSA	Huh, if only.
KATRIN	If he's alive why would he contact me?
MARISSA	That depends on whether you believe he's innocent, or not.
KATRIN	I'm an old woman with a broken
MARISSA	- What's in the past, stays in the past, right?
KATRIN	Something like that.
MARISSA	So why all the years of snooping around and sticking your nose in?
KATRIN	You'd understand if you had kids. She turns her back on MARISSA.
MARISSA	Kid's, they fuck you up, don't they? MARISSA stands up, puts a 9mm to the back KATRIN'S head and KATRIN drops to the floor revealing a framed, blood
SOPHIE	Can't you sleep?
HANNA	No.
SOPHIE	Me neither. SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)	Hanna?
HANNA	Yes?
SOPHIE	Where do you really come from?
HANNA	Leipzig, I live in Leipzig - SOPHIE looses her patience.
SOPHIE	If we're going to be friends you have to be honest with me. Them's the rules. HANNA is taken aback.
HANNA	Are we friends?
SOPHIE	Yes. I like you.
HANNA	I'd like to have a friend.
SOPHIE	I mean you're a freak and everything, but I like you.
HANNA	I like you too. I really do. But there are things I can't tell you. Do you understand?
SOPHIE	Yes... Actually, no, I don't.
HANNA	There are people that want to harm me. Bad people.
SOPHIE	I see.
HANNA	And they wont stop.
SOPHIE	Right.
HANNA	So for your own safety... HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes.
HANNA (CONT'D)	Can we still be friends?
SOPHIE	I don't know. I mean, I don't really know who you are. Do I?
HANNA	That's just it. Neither do I. She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it
SOPHIE	What is it?
HANNA	I think it's about me. DNA is kind of how we're made I think. I mean who we are. They look at it.
SOPHIE	What will you do?
HANNA	I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet my father at the house of Wilhelm Grimm.
SOPHIE	As in âGrimm's Fairytalesâ?
HANNA	That's right. SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.
SOPHIE	If you say so.
HANNA	Did I say the wrong thing again? SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a
SOPHIE	Keep this. To remember me. HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)	It's a friendship bracelet.
HANNA	Thank you. HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's He is in the slightly dated suit he wore when he left the
ERIK (SIGHS, EXHAUSTED)	I need a room.
RECEPTIONIST	Yes of course.
ERIK	I stayed here fifteen years ago. It hasn't changed.
RECEPTIONIST	We don't much like change here.
ERIK	Neither do I.
RECEPTIONIST	Name?
ERIK	Olsson. Peter Olsson.
RECEPTIONIST	You have some post. She turns and retrieves HANNA'S POSTCARD from the mail rack
ERIK	Thank you. ERIK reads: âMission accomplishedâ
RECEPTIONIST	Have you heard about the manhunt? A man has killed two coastguards. Everybody is being asked to keep an eye out.
ERIK	For what exactly?
RECEPTIONIST	I don't know. He smiles. She takes a closer look and notices goose fat
HANNA	How long until you drop me off?
RACHEL	We should have you there by dinner time. From Lille you can get a train to Berlin. Leipzig's just a few hours further. HANNA and SOPHIE exchange a look.
ISAACS	Wake up. It's them. He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the The BMW pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly
ISAACS	Keep your distance.
RECEPTIONIST	Is that the police? Yes, I don't want to trouble you but I have a new guest you may wish to know about. POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching He moves off and enters a small bar. As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after There's a brief exchange of blows. One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun. HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a Following in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his
HANNA	...they can live at freezing temperatures for up to nine months without food. Imagine that, nine months.
RACHEL	Why do you know so much about fleas?
HANNA	I read it in my Encyclopaedia. HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW Also, they can jump around 200 times their own body length, which makes them the best jumpers of all known animals except for the froghopper. Now they can really jump. RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror
RACHEL	Everything all right?
HANNA	I think so. But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.
JOANNA (V.O.)	Mama, I know you're disappointed in me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama. But I have found maybe a way to make it better... I'm in a program now... a program to make babies stronger. In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton
JOANNA (V.O.)	An American program. It's very scientific. Important scientific work. Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the tape machine and
JOANNA (V.O.)	Erik says he can get these tapes to Bastard. - He says I look beautiful. I don't feel beautiful... MARISSA doesn't care, fast forwards. Play -
JOHANNA (V.O.)	...I'm not sure if it's true that the baby can hear, but at night I sing. I hope it hears me. MARISSA listens, for some unknown reason to MARISSA this The phone rings.
MARISSA	What?
RECEPTIONIST	Frau Wiegler, this is reception. I have one Erik Heller for you. MARISSA stops dead.
MARISSA	Put him on. You were supposed to be dead.
MARISSA	So were you.
ERIK	Well, here we are.
MARISSA	How did you know I was here?
ERIK	I killed one of your men. Got his cellphone. You've gotten soft.
MARISSA (O.S.)	No, I just grew up. The world's changed since you died.
ERIK	You got kids?
MARISSA	No, I made choices.
ERIK	Hanna's practically yours, you know? This goes straight to an ache that's been building in
MARISSA	Not interested. But she is.
ERIK	She's true and good and funny. Yeah, she's funny. She's special. You should see her.
MARISSA	I'm looking forward to it.
ERIK	You'll have to catch her first. The line goes dead. MARISSA puts the phone down and sits Was it like this for you, Mama? I think I know what the baby looks like. I think it's a girl -- I hope so.
JOANNA (V.O.)	I wonder who she'll be? I hope she's smart. I hope she's a stronger person than I am. RACHEL is still at the wheel, watching the bright headlights
RACHEL	Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I think we're lost, Hanna. HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.
RACHEL (CONT'D)	I'm going to pull over.
HANNA	No, don't.
RACHEL	I need to check the map. On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The
RACHEL	Why won't that car pass? He has his lights on high beam, I was doing everything I could to get out of the way... SOPHIE wakes up in the back.
SOPHIE	Are we stopped? I need to pee.
RACHEL	Well, I don't want you going too far right now.
HANNA	I think you should stay where you are, Sophie. HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the
RACHEL	Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake up.
HANNA	Please.
SOPHIE	This is creepy. You're creeping me out. Are we in Lille?
HANNA	I'm sorry. But you really mustn't get out of the van. HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to What ever you do, don't follow me. Promise not to follow me.
SOPHIE	I promise.
RACHEL	Hanna, tell me what's going on or Seb will go over to that car and find out.
SEB	Like fuck I will. Everyone stay put. Where's my phone? Thank you for being my friend. HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts
RACHEL	Hanna! RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA. ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed. ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.
ISAACS (O.S.)	Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You need to come with me now. I know where your papa is. She listens. ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again.
ISAACS (CONT'D)	He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He misses you. The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double- HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too. ISAACS follow below. HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the She's trapped.
ISAACS (CONT'D)	Just take it easy. HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS. She rolls and springs to her feet. The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick. HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the A large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and SEB paces around his cell. RACHEL sits stoically in hers. MARISSA walks into SOPHIE'S cell.
MARISSA	Would you please stop crying?
SOPHIE	I'm not telling you anything.
MARISSA	Honey, your friend is in a lot of danger. You need to help us find her.
SOPHIE	I don't know where to find her! MARISSA grits her teeth, shows SOPHIE a photo of FELICIANO.
MARISSA	Do you know him?
SOPHIE	No.
MARISSA	He knows you. MARISSA now in RACHEL'S cell.
RACHEL	We gave her a ride because we thought she was in trouble.
MARISSA	But you knew she didn't have a passport. You smuggled her into port and helped her illegally gain
RACHEL	She said she lived in Leipzig. She went to the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.
MARISSA	There is no Klaus Kohle Gymnasium. It closed five years ago. Shock on Rachel's face.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Did she give any idea of where she was going? Rachel wracks her brains.
RACHEL	She said she was going home, to Leipzig. She seemed lost. Like she needed taking care of. You understand. MARISSA shows her the photograph of JOANNA ZADEK.
MARISSA	This was Hanna's mother, Joanna Zadek. Fifteen years ago Hanna's father shot her to death on a camping holiday by the Baltic. RACHEL swallows, goes pale. MARISSA now in SEB'S cell.
SEB	She was odd. I'll give you that. Disconnected. I mean I get on with most kids, you know, have a rapport. But, this one -
MARISSA	You know, Mr Lyall, it's days like these that I really hate my job.
SEB	I'm sure you do.
MARISSA	It's a very, very difficult thing to do.
SEB	Absolutely.
MARISSA	But sometimes children are bad people too. MARISSA in MILES'S cell. MILES is terrified of MARISSA. She
MARISSA (CONT'D)	I'm not going to hurt you. MILES shrinks from her touch.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Miles is a nice name. Are you a nice boy? She strokes MILES' hair and immediately he starts crying SEB pounds on the wall from his cell.
SEB	Hey what's going on in there? We don't have to put up with this! We're in the EU, Goddammit!
MARISSA	Three days ago Hanna's father killed two Danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife.
SEB	Where is he now?
MARISSA	He's still at large and he's still very dangerous. We need to find Hanna before he does. Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa notices.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	If you know anything at all, it's vital you tell us for her own safety. We are now very worried about her. But SOPHIE doesn't say a word.
RACHEL	Sophie? Still nothing. They all look at her. MILES suddenly speaks.
MILES	She's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm Grimm's house.
SOPHIE (TO MILES)	You little bastard!
RACHEL	How did you know that?
SOPHIE	You fuckwad! SOPHIE slaps MILES over the back of the head but SEB pushes
SEB	Hey hey hey! Sophie for God's sake. The passenger door next to her opens and ISAACS gets in.
ISAACS	I've looked through Heller's contacts from the 1980's. There's no one called Wilhelm.
MARISSA	Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He died two hundred years ago. MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the
ISAACS	What the hell is this? MARISSA smiles slightly.
MARISSA	Wilhelm's house. Drive on. People swarm around her but pay her no mind. HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She
KNEPFLER	Excuse me young lady? It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small,
HANNA	Are you Wilhelm Grimm?
KNEPFLER	Not exactly, but it'll do for now. Come this way. He leads her inside.
KNEPFLER	So you are Hanna. He puts out his hand to shake.
KNEPFLER (CONT'D)	It's very nice to meet you, Hanna. HANNA smiles and shakes his hand, she likes him already.
KNEPFLER (CONT'D)	My real name is Knepfler. Herr Knepfler. I'm an old friend of your father's. I am a sort of âcaretakerâ here.
HANNA	What happened to it? No car park. You need a car park these days, otherwise people wont come. But somebody has to watch over it...
HANNA	It's beautiful.
KNEPFLER	I like it too. Erik used to come here a great deal.
HANNA	Have you heard from him? He nods.
KNEPFLER	You must wait. He will be here soon. HANNA stares, not quite believing. HANNA stares out the window, thinking all this through.
KNEPFLER	Please, sit down. HANNA sits at the old kitchen table on a wooden bench, while
KNEPFLER (CONT'D)	Would you like an egg? They're fresh.
HANNA	Please. HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw.
KNEPFLER	You'll need a fresh photograph. Don't get it wet. HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE
HANNA	I don't really understand.
KNEPFLER	ID. Identity. It tells people who you are. She stares at the passport with the blank space for her
KNEPFLER (CONT'D)	There is an apartment ready for you in the south. Erik will come and the car will take you there today. You will live there now.
HANNA	Do I have to?
KNEPFLER	Don't you want to?
HANNA	I don't know. I miss the forest. I miss my home.
KNEPFLER	That's to be expected. But the city is so exciting, don't you think?
HANNA	I suppose. She drinks her water, thinking.
HANNA (CONT'D)	Did you know my mother?
KNEPFLER	I did.
HANNA	What was she like?
KNEPFLER	She was very gentle, she was very funny, very talented - a singer - did you know that?
HANNA	Yes...
KNEPFLER	She had your eyes. He smiles at her. She here's a noise outside and runs to look out the window.
HANNA	It's him.
KNEPFLER	Quick. KNEPFLER leads HANNA out of the kitchen.
KNEPFLER	Upstairs. There's a knock at the door. HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches There's another knock at the door. She can hear the sound of ISAAC'S MEN starting to spread
KNEPFLER (O.O.V)	Listen to me, listen. There is no one here. There is nobody up there... Check the attic. Footsteps to the attic.
MARISSA	Erik Heller? Do you know him?
KNEPFLER	I have never heard of him.
MARISSA	Really? MARISSA shows him the photograph of JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER
KNEPFLER	I don't know these people.
MARISSA	Think very carefully He shrugs and MARISSA grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks
KNEPFLER	He called me. She's coming soon. To meet him.
MARISSA	When?
KNEPFLER	Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning. MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS.
MARISSA	Take him in there. Find out what he knows. The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress
MARISSA	Lewis. It's Marissa. HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she
MARISSA (CONT'D)	You got anything? He's coming here. I can smell it. Double the men. But, Lewis, I want to talk to him. HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the
ISAACS	His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used to send Heller's things from Berlin before the Communists were kicked out of Prague.
MARISSA	How much does he know about the programme?
ISAACS	Everything. He knew Johanna.
MARISSA	What does he know about the child?
ISAACS	He also thinks Erik's the father.
MARISSA	Well that's good.
ISAACS	Everybody thinks Erik's her father. Erik probably thinks he's her father. They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely
MARISSA	Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him yet?
ISAACS	Let's see what else Knepfler has to offer. He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she
OWNER	Excuse me. You have to pay first.
HANNA	How much?
OWNER	3 Euros for half an hour. She looks at the money that Knepfler gave her. It contains
HANNA	How does it work?
OWNER	You've never used the internet?
HANNA	No. He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner brings
OWNER	Just type whatever it is you're looking for here. He walks away and HANNA slowly starts to type. She types in HELLER watches for a moment or two. HELLER crouches back down against the wall, thinking Phrases from the text leap out at her. âAn interfering HANNA stands in shock. She reads again. âIntervention to the HANNA deletes the page. Sits in shock. Then writes in her Immediately the article about JOHANNA's death comes up. HANNA
ISAACS	Isaacs. He listens. Puts the phone down.
ISAACS (CONT'D)	A public computer at a Berlin internet cafe just did a web search for âDNA Interfering Sequenceâ.
MARISSA	Hanna?
ISAACS	Next they searched the name Johanna Zadek. MARISSA stops dead. Looks at ISAACS.
MARISSA	She's not coming here. HANNA gets out of the taxi and looks up at an enormous grey She approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers. A door further along opens. Kurdish music pours out. A
HANNA	Excuse me. I'm looking for Joanna Zadek's house. Can you help? The KURDISH WOMAN wont look HANNA in the eye as she passes.
KURDISH WOMAN	I don't speak German. HANNA kicks at the door but knows it won't be answered so HANNA walks round to the back door of the apartment and HANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks HANNA steps back and gags. She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will
ERIK (V.O.)	You won't find anything. HANNA turns in shock.
ERIK	Marissa would have been much too careful for that. HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.
ERIK (CONT'D)	Sit down Hanna.
HANNA	Are you my father?
ERIK	Sit down.
HANNA	Are you my father?
ERIK	Please.
HANNA	Are you? Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing
ERIK	I was going to tell you. HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast.
HANNA	What's wrong with me? ERIK flinches slightly.
ERIK	Nothing.
HANNA	Where was I born? ERIK knows he has to tell the truth.
ERIK	At Galinka.
HANNA	What's that?
ERIK	It was a secret CIA research programme in rural Poland.
HANNA	What kind of research?
ERIK	Children. HANNA stares at ERIK.
ERIK (CONT'D)	It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The science came from the old East Germany. The money from the CIA. The intention was to explore whether small genetic changes could be made to embryos... to improve Improve? ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so lost.
ERIK	Reduce capacity for fear. For pity. Increase muscle strength. Heighten senses. Anything that might make a better soldier. HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about.
HANNA	How did you know about it? ERIK's stares right at her.
ERIK	I worked for it. She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his This is what you were looking for. HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to
ERIK (CONT'D)	I recruited your mother at an abortion clinic in May 1994. She was about to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Some boy at a disco. HANNA looks at the paper in shock.
ERIK (CONT'D)	I had recruited twenty women. She was the last. She was different. Two years later I heard the programme was to be terminated. The research âdisposed ofâ.
HANNA	Disposed of?
ERIK	I tried to save all of you. But you were the only one I was able to rescue. HANNA stands in shock. She reaches to the window of the room
ERIK (CONT'D)	Hanna listen to me.
HANNA	Keep away from me. ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.
ERIK	It worked. You worked.
HANNA	You mean I'm a killer?
ERIK	No... no.. He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent
HANNA	Don't touch me.
ERIK	We have a new identity for you. A new life. A new beginning. She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes
ERIK (CONT'D)	Don't. She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight
HANNA	Let me go. He releases her. She goes to the door.
ERIK	I tried to prepare you for what your life would be.
HANNA	You didn't prepare me for this. And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK
ERIK	Hanna wait. He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block.
MARISSA	That's him. And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the
MARISSA (O.C.)	Drop it. MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him. Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.
ERIK	So go ahead. She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can
MARISSA	You know I'll find her.
ERIK	Don't under estimate what you created.
MARISSA	What we created, together.
MARISSA	Truth is I was always very fond of you.
MARISSA	Leave him here. And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was
ISAACS	They had a fight.
MARISSA	She must know the truth.
ISAACS	Where do you think she's gone?
MARISSA	Where would you go? MARISSA turns to ISAACS.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	I'm closing the CIA operation down. Heller is dead, that's all that matters to them. This we do alone. In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her
HANNA	I am looking for a train to Galinka.
GUARD	Galinka is a small village. No trains. You must wait for bus in the morning.
HANNA	Where can I stay? He points. HANNA sees the hotel.
HANNA	Do you have a sandwich?
BARMAN	Kitchen is closed. The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.
BUSINESSMAN	Get her something. Poor girl's hungry. The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	I'm from Leipzig. HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig.
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	You?
HANNA	The same.
BUSINESSMAN	Business? He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives.
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	Where are you going?
HANNA	I am tired. I need to sleep. She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs.
BUSINESSMAN	Hello? She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	I was just making nice conversation. Yes? As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	Let's talk. Maybe we can do business. HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	You don't like talk, huh? He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)	Be nice. Be a nice little dolly. HANNA is thrust on to the bed, but suddenly turns him over When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next HANNA suddenly recoils in horror. Shocked by the viciousness Tears begins to run down her cheeks as HANNA grabs the man's
HANNA	I have this much. Can you take me to Galinka? Suddenly the taxi stops.
DRIVER	This is as far as the money gets you. HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.
HANNA	How much further?
DRIVER	Twelve miles.
HANNA	Please. But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies past She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead. Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by, HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on. Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost
HANNA (CONT'D)	I'm going to Galinka. Can you help me? A woman's voice, German, in German.
WOMAN (V.O.)	Yes I can take you there. And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling MARISSA speaks in perfect German. Calm, soft, comforting.
MARISSA	It's a very dull place Galinka. Why would you want to go there?
HANNA	I was born there. But I've never really seen it. Why are you going?
MARISSA	I have some business to sort out. She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	It's very lucky we ran into each other, don't you think?
HANNA	Yes...
MARISSA	You've hurt your arm.
HANNA	It's okay. MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.
MARISSA	I'm Astrid.
HANNA	You're not German. Are you American?
MARISSA	That's right. I lived there for many years. I travel a lot. MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Oh dear, what's wrong with you?
HANNA	Sorry.
MARISSA	It's okay. Are you in trouble? HANNA nods. She fights the tears.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	What sort of trouble?
HANNA	I don't know what to do. Nothing is what I thought it would be. It's... ugly and cruel and I don't know where to go, or... I'm stupid. I don't know what I expected... MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the
MARISSA	Sometimes I feel the same way. HANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman.
HANNA	I like music.
MARISSA	Sleep why don't you? You look very tired. It will take half an hour on this road. HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has
HANNA	Where are we? MARISSA calms herself instantly.
MARISSA	Nearly there. HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES. This is it.
HANNA	It's so small.
MARISSA	Yes. Just a few cottages. And the old bunker. HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.
HANNA	Thank you for the ride. You're very kind.
MARISSA	I wish there was more I could do for you. MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Here, take this. HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	I hope you find what you're looking for.
HANNA	Thank you. She gets out and shuts the door behind her. HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her. HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red She walks on into the dark. HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff, She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns. She walks on through the tunnels. At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames.
CHILDREN	Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you... From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of
CHILDREN (CONT'D)	Happy Biirrrrthday, dear... The CHILDREN arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.
CHILDREN (CONT'D)	... Hanna. Happy Birthday to you! HANNA leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The HANNA swings her torch beam in the direction of the HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from
HANNA	You're Marissa Wiegler. HANNA starts to shake. MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is
MARISSA	Don't worry sweetie. I don't want to hurt you. MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	I could have killed you already when you were asleep in the car. HANNA'S still shaking. HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all
MARISSA (CONT'D)	Did Erik tell you about this place?
HANNA	Where are the other children? She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.
MARISSA	Sleeping. They're all sleeping.
HANNA	I don't believe you.
MARISSA	I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure you walk out of here and keep walking. Grow up and grow old in safety and security. No one need know a thing. But you have to trust me. You can't talk about this with anyone. It's what we call âclassified.â If you tell anyone, it'll be dangerous for both of us. HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying
HANNA	You killed my mother.
MARISSA	You're mother didn't want you, sweetie. I saved you. HANNA just stares, not believing her.
MARISSA (CONT'D)	I'm the only person left who understands who you are. The only one who cares. MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA, for HANNA to take, a
MARISSA (CONT'D)	I practically am your mother. HANNA'S stomach turns in horror. She switches off her torch ISAACS raises his gun fires. HANNA crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel. We see his point Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pearly She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face. HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle. She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small She fires but is off target and only catches the HENCHMAN'S He drops his torch which slides across the floor. She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet. She switches the torch off. Alerted by the sound of ISAACS' shot HANNA starts to pursue Suddenly the bed he's under is lifted straight up in the air With all his might ISAACS pushes at the bed and lifts it off They fight. HANNA picks up the torch and slams the torch across his HANNA sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands -
HANNA	No more. No more. Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes
HANNA (CONT'D)	Everything I see is nothing I want. MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance.
MARISSA	Let me take care of you?
HANNA	No. I don't want that. HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the MARISSA watches her walk away. HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.
MARISSA	Hanna. HANNA spins, fires directly at CAMERA. The sun spreads its golden fingers through the trees catching A wide shot of the HANNA'S cabin, wisps of smoke rise from HANNA steps out of the cabin. She's back wearing her furs In VOICE-OVER we hear HANNA reading from her beloved
HANNA (V.O.)	The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours
HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)	Home to millions of species, including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to
HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)	The planet formed over four and a half billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her It is expected to continue supporting life for another one and a half billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate it all. HANNA surveys her beautiful world.
