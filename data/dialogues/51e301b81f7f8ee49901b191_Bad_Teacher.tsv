CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
To establish.	A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads,
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Well, it's been another great year here at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus' haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you. SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly
SANDY	I ain't afraid of no ghost. The other teachers laugh.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Or the wild success of...
VOICE (O.C.)	Wally, can I just say one quick thing? Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and
AMY	Just wanted to remind everyone the school day's not over. So let's keep the drinking under control, hmm? That's it. Back to you, Wally. A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Thanks, Amy, . Or the wild success of the book drive for the women's prison sponsored by Ms. Savicki's class? A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods.
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)	But now as the summer is upon us, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to a member of our faculty. Elizabeth, can you come up here? ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)	You've only been with us for one short year, but know that you'll always be a part of the JAMS family. Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile. And we got you a little something. Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.
ELIZABETH	Almost forty dollars. Thank you!
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Why don't you say a couple words?
ELIZABETH	Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this type of thing so I'll make it quick. I know I've only been here a year, but there's so much I'm going to miss...
ELIZABETH (V.0.)	My students, probably most of all.I'm not saying they were little angels, butthey were all there to learn and that'sthe greatest gift a student can give a teacher. Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
ELIZABETH (V.0.)	And I wish that I had gotten to know all of you better, but between four classes and planning a wedding, I had my hands full. From the little I do know about you, I know that our students are in good hands. Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully
ELIZABETH (V.0.)	And I can't believe it's all over. This year flew by. And even though I'll never teach again professionally, I've realized that I don't need a blackboard and classroom to set an example. Elizabeth comes up behind them.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Hand it over. The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Everything. The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	This was a warning. Next time, I don't call the principal. I call the cops.
ELIZABETH (O.S.)	Woo-hoo! A couple students look at her strangely.
ANGLE ON	The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.
DIM-LOOKING KID	You are... Illit... Illit... Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the
JANITOR	Slow down! Baby Doll?
MARK (O.S.)	Coming! MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear. Hey! That was a quick party. Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands
ELIZABETH	Yeah. You should have seen it. What a joke. She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Here's to me never having to work again. And I owe it all to you, Lover. Elizabeth takes a big sip. So I made a reservation at Ruth's Chris, and then I booked us a suite at the Drake, and I thought we could finish the night in "anal alley." Hmm? Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns
MARK	See? Nothing. Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES. Motherfucker!
ELIZABETH	How could you do this to me?! I'm sorry.
ELIZABETH	You are buying me the biggest pair of yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm talking serious blood diamonds. Sheila SNEEZES again. Bless you. Get out of my house, bitch!
MARK	Don't talk to her like that.
ELIZABETH	Excuse me? I love her. Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's
ELIZABETH	You love her? She's a hooker.
MARK SHEILA	She's not a hooker. I dance. Elizabeth takes a deep breath. Listen, Marky, you made a mistake. You're human. I'm human. And this time it was you. Maybe six months from now, you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but probably. Sheila SNEEZES again.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Shut the fuck up. And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't want to throw away our life together over something like this. We're getting married! I'm willing to fight for us.
MARK	I'm not. And you know why? Because Sheila loves me -- and not just for my money. Sheila squeezes his shoulder.
ELIZABETH	I'm sorry if I care that my future husband can support me. We didn't all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths. You can't even imagine what it's like going to bed hungry, night after night.
MARK	What are you talking about?! Both your parents are CPAs.
ELIZABETH	My parents worked their asses off to send me to private school. Do you know what it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone else gets a Beemer the second they menstruate? That shit stays with you.
MARK	It's over, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH	For the record, there's a shitload of things that I hate about you, but I still, would've gotten married. Because I love you.
MARK	I'm gonna need the ring back. She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows.
ELIZABETH	You sad little troll! I hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together!
MARK	Elizabeth. The ring.
ELIZABETH	I'm not even listening to you anymore. She starts to open the door. He closes it.
ELIZABETH	Like I even want your gay-ass ring. She tries pulling it off.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	It's not coming off. I'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow. Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease.
ELIZABETH	You've gotta be shitting me.
AMY'S CLASSROOM	The room has been decorated to within an inch of its Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying
AMY	Elizabeth Halsey, as I live and breathe!
ELIZABETH	Amy Squirrel.
AMY	I know we barely got a chance to get to know one another last year -- what with you planning the wedding of the century and me juggling all my extra-currics -- but I just want to say that I'm super excited to be across-the-hall-mates.
ELIZABETH	Okay.
AMY	And I know you kinda skated by last year, doing the bare minimum thing -- you were kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're back and I just know that you are going to rededicate yourself to the task at --
AMY (CONT'D)	Where's your beautiful ring?
ELIZABETH	My fiance and I broke it off. I found him in bed with someone else. Oh my gosh!
ELIZABETH	It was another man. Shut the front door! Somebody needs a hug.
ELIZABETH	Somebody doesn't.
AMY	Hm. Another time then. Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk. These washed?
AMY	Of course. I'd never serve a student unwashed fruit. CRUNCH. Elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple. I thought the teachers got the apples.
AMY	Well, I think the students teach me at least as'much as I teach them.
ELIZABETH	Stupid. Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash
LYNN	Oh sorry, am I interrupting?
ELIZABETH	Um -- kinda.
LYNN	Do you want to grab some lunch?
ELIZABETH	I'm in the middle of something, Lynn. My treat.
ELIZABETH	Fine.
LYNN	You have that thing going around, huh?
LYNN	Are you excited for tomorrow?
ELIZABETH	Is tomorrow Saturday?
LYNN	No, it's the first day of school.
ELIZABETH	Wait, I thought I had a week to get my class together.
LYNN	Yeah, that was last week.
ELIZABETH	Fuck my ass.
LYNN	If you hate teaching so much, why don't you just get another job?
ELIZABETH	And do what? Sell perfume at the mall? Work at a day care center? You know, when I first got into teaching, I thought I was doing it for all the right reasons: short hours, summers off, no accountability.
LYNN	I love my summers. Fresh corn. Mmm.
ELIZABETH	From now on, my full-time job will be finding a guy who will take care of me --
LYNN	Oh god, I pray for that --
ELIZABETH	And that makes a shit ton of money and doesn't ask too many questions. I spent most of my summer hanging out at the bars near where the Bulls practice. Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to settle down. And they all wear condoms. And then they take the condoms with them. That's how paranoid they are that a girl will try and get pregnant. Like it's so easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting into a condom.
LYNN	You're gonna find someone great.
ELIZABETH	I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean, I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I get my new tits, I'll probably be a --
LYNN	You don't want to do that. You're already so pretty.
ELIZABETH	I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a chance against all those Barbies dolls out there. Anna Nicole had it right, may she rest in peace. Lynn checks her watch.
LYNN	We should finish up. Wally's doing that big orientation for teachers in the auditorium.
ELIZABETH	Yeah, I'm not going to that.
LYNN	But it's mandatory.
ELIZABETH	Ooohhh...
LYNN	Yeah, I probably won't go either. I don't know I might. I'll probably go, but just sit in the back. Maybe leave early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it by ear. Or just stay till the end. Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them.
LYNN (CONT'D)	This was fun.
ELIZABETH	Yeah, it was alright. When you said you were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it was going to be nicer, but this was okay.
LYNN	Sorry.
ELIZABETH	It's okay. You can get me next time.
ELIZABETH	Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me with Jessica Simpson's tits? He stares at her chest intently. She's not bothered by it. Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door.
ELIZABETH	Cool, yeah. She glances at the clock: 3:14 AM.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Fuck my ass.
CHASE	The photographer was, like, sooo nice. He made me feel sooo comfortable. I might get flown to Kansas City for their fashion week. Oh my. Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as
CHASE	Stalk much? Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An Faggot. Bless you.
TRISTAN	What'd you say to me? Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the
SASHA	Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet you. My mother baked these for you.
ELIZABETH	Just leave them on the desk. Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	You need something? - Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Anyone here seen "Stand and Deliver?" Show of hands. No one? Edward James Olmos? Wow. Elizabeth takes a DVD from her bag. She points to two
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	You and you, go grab the TV and roll it up front. And you, go shut off the lights. The two kids, SHAWN and SPENCER, roll the TV over. Sasha
SASHA	We're watching a movie on the first day? I think it's awesome. You rock.
GARRETT	I agree with Chase. Elizabeth pops in the DVD. "Stand and Deliver," starring
ELIZABETH	Ugh. Oatmeal raisin? She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her
ANGLE ON	GARRETT, sitting alone, writing in a journal. Tristan,
TRISTAN	Incoming! Direct hit. The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder. Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes
AMY	Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.
AMY	Did you see what just happened?
ELIZABETH	Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with the cole slaw.
AMY	You weren't at the orientation the other day, but we're doing something new this year. It's very exciting. We're splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.
AMY (CONT'D)	So, anyways, in order for the quadrant system to work, it's vital that each teacher maintain order within their quadrant. Because it's really tough for me as head lunch monitor -- or another teacher -- to leave their quadrant to discipline a kid in another quadrant. I know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy to sit with-you after school and explain all of the new guidelines.
ELIZABETH	Tell you what. Why don't you send me a memo, and if I have any questions, I'll come to you.
AMY	Okay, Elizabeth. Sounds like a plan, Stan. Oh, I meant to ask you. Did I hear that you were showing a movie this morning?
ELIZABETH	How do I know what you heard?
AMY	Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to tell you how to run your class, but maybe it might be fun to do some ice-breakers. Like "Telephone Charades" or "The String Game." Or start doing practice questions for the state test. It's never too soon to start.
ELIZABETH	Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?
AMY	Oh, shishkebobs, no. If I gave you that impression, I am so sorry. Actually, I was really hoping that we could be more than across-the-hall-mates.
ELIZABETH	I don't know what you've heard, but I don't munch box.
AMY	No, of course not. I don't even know what that is. I just meant friends.
ELIZABETH	Like getting manicures and going shopping on Sundays? Shit like that?
AMY	Yes! Yes! And helping each other out. Looking out for one another.
ELIZABETH	That's cool. Tell you what, friend, I'm gonna get going. Cover for me? Elizabeth doesn't wait for an answer, walks off. But you can't leave. Lunch doesn't end for another... Seven minutes. Who's going to watch your quadrant? Hi there. You look a little lost.
SCOTT	Hi. Can you tell me where Room 124 is?
ELIZABETH	I'll do you one better. I'll take you there.
SCOTT	Oh, you don't have to do that.
ELIZABETH	Will you stop? It'd be my pleasure.
SCOTT	Thanks! I feel like I've been walking around in circles for the last fifteen minutes. Scott Delacorte. I'm the new sub.
ELIZABETH	Elizabeth Halsey, 7th Grade Language Arts. Welcome, welcome. They shake hands a beat too long. Elizabeth notices
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Helluva watch. What's that -- a Jaeger- LeCoultre?
SCOTT	Good eye!
ELIZABETH	Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind of a hobby.
SCOTT	It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed a village for .a year, but my grandfather designed it, so...
ELIZABETH	Oh? Your grandfather designs watches?
SCOTT	The family business. My mom's maiden name is Jaeger.
ELIZABETH	Shut up!
SCOTT	My parents had a minor meltdown when I decided to join the Peace Corps and become a teacher. But they've been cool about it. Elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall.
SCOTT (CONT'D)	Integrity.
SCOTT	The poster. "Integrity." What a great message for the kids.
ELIZABETH	That's why I got it. They turn a corner. Garrett wheels his backpack past them.
GARRETT	Hey, Ms. Halsey!
ELIZABETH	Hey... dude... She slaps him five. Scott notices, smiles.
SCOTT	Man, I can't wait for the day that I have my own classroom.
ELIZABETH	Yeah... So did you and your wife just move to town?
SCOTT	I'm not married.
ELIZABETH	Me neither. I was engaged until I walked in on my fiance cheating on me. With his brother.
SCOTT	That's horrible! Ooh, 124! This is me.
ELIZABETH	Nice to meet you, Scott Delacourte. Hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each other. Only if a teacher gets sick. Great meeting you, Elizabeth Halsey. He heads into the room. Elizabeth cocks her head, Very nice meeting you.
CLOSE ON	A PAIR OF PERFECT FAKE BREASTS. A hand cups them from Pull back to reveal DR. VOGEL, 40s, and his receptionist,
DR. VOGEL	As you can see, the weight is evenly distributed and there's minimal scarring. Dr. Vogel. "Best Hands in Chicago."
DR. VOGEL	Absolutely. Take them for a spin. Elizabeth reaches out, squeezes Danni's breasts.
ELIZABETH	Wow. And the nipples are just... I love them. I'll take two. They all laugh. Elizabeth notices Dr. Vogel'.s watch.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Maurice Lacroix. That's a great watch. And how's that going?
DR. VOGEL	She's my rock. Alright, thanks, Danni. Danni puts her bra and blouse back on and exits.
DR. VOGEL (CONT'D)	So, Elizabeth, have you given any thought to size?
ELIZABETH	I was thinking, you know, maybe a D.
DR. VOGEL	IJh huh, uh huh. I ,would say, though, with your frame, you might consider something smaller. A large B, maybe a C cup. You'd be surprised how significant those would look.
ELIZABETH	Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll go with the D's, really turn some heads.
DR. VOGEL	You know, Elizabeth, breast enhancement's not a cure-all. I just want to make sure you have realistic expectations.
ELIZABETH	Doctor, I lost my fiance to a woman with monster fake tits. So now I need monster fake tits so that I won't lose my next fiance. Those are my expectations. Is that realistic enough for you?
DR. VOGEL	Very good then.
DANNI	So you'll be off your feet for about two weeks... what works for you?
ELIZABETH	Let's do December 19th. Start of winter break.
DANNI	The 19th it is. So the total is $9300 for the surgery plus one night stay at our facility. How would you like to pay? Elizabeth laughs. Danni laughs.
ELIZABETH	That's absurd. What if I don't spend the night at your facility?
DANNI	The night's included in the price. Did you not read our literature?
ELIZABETH	No. A MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR walks by.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Hi... Listen, I'm a teacher, not a drug dealer.
DANNI	We accept all major credit cards.
ELIZABETH	My credit situation is complicated.
DANNI	I'm sorry, but if you can't pay, I can't schedule the appointment. You know, there are less expensive options. Have you looked into South America?
ELIZABETH	I'll be back. Elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the Look, I just really need some money. It's, for a surgery I need. Elizabeth pokes holes in the Lean Cuisine with a knife Yes, as a matter of fact, it is about my breasts, dad. Sorry. Happy belated birthday. So, can you wire me some money or not?
ELIZABETH	So I won't beat around the bush, Grammy. I'm dying and I need money for surgery. Really? Nothing? Don't you get social security or something? Elizabeth goes around to another tire. Slash.
ELIZABETH	Listen, limpdick, you owe me for breaking off the engagement. Do you know how embarrassing that was?! Lover, I don't want to fight. It's just 10000 dollars and it would really mean the world to me. Lover? You there? Elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall. It smashes.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Fucking Troll! Kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom.
KIRK	Did you call my name?
ELIZABETH	No. I said 'fucking troll.'
KIRK	Oh, I thought you said Kirk. He turns and heads back in to his room.
ELIZABETH	Hey, you got ten grand?
KIRK	Nope. Kirk closes his door. After a beat, he opens it.
KIRK (CONT'D)	Also, I might be a little short on the rent this month. Like, a lot short.
LYNN	I don't know. That's a lot of money.
ELIZABETH	I know. And I hate asking a friend for money -- especially as good a friend as you. This has its desired effect on Lynn.
LYNN	Maybe I could sell that jewelry my grandmother gave me?
ELIZABETH	That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's buying that. But it looks great on you.
LYNN	Thanks. What about Mark?
ELIZABETH	What type of person do you think I am?! That assbag cheated on me. Did I ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick?
ELIZABETH	I'm just trying to better myself. I don't think that's asking for so much. Amy walks over.
AMY	'Scuse,me. Just gonna scooch in here. She drops quarters into the vending machine, but doesn't Sooo... I know it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and I just want to say, that you shouldn't change a thing. You should be happy with the way you are. That's true.
ELIZABETH	Huh. Well, do you think mental retards should be happy with the way they are? Amy stammers. Lynn, you teach them. What do you think? I've never asked them.
AMY	I would never --
ELIZABETH	We don't all have your tits, Squirrel. So maybe you should think before you interrupt a private conversation.
AMY	I guess that's what you get for trying to help... Amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and
ELIZABETH	That's right. Walk away. There he is! Scott enters. All of the female teachers light up.
AMY	Well, look what the cat dragged in!
SCOTT	I wish it was under better circumstances. Stu Riley's car was vandalized last night. Right in his driveway.
AMY	Gang members, probably. The public school system failed them. Elizabeth and Amy nod vigorously.
JOE CLARK (V.0.)	So forget about the way it used to be. This is not a damn democracy! We are in a state of emergency and my word is law! There's only one boss around here, and that's me. The HNIC.
MS. LEVIAS (ON TV)	Head Nigger In Charge. The bell RINGS.
ELIZABETH	We'll pick this up again tomorrow. The students shuffle out. Garrett hustles after Chase.
GARRETT	Quite a film, huh? Chase gives him a weird look and then exits with her friends.
ELIZABETH	What.
SASHA	I'm a student leader for the D.C. trip --
ELIZABETH	Shocker.
SASHA	And we're having our car wash this weekend. If you're around, maybe we could wash your car.
ELIZABETH	I've got some Mexicans who already do it for nothing.
SASHA	It's for a good cause. This year, we're trying to get some extra money so that we can go on a Duck Tour! She hands Elizabeth a flyer. Elizabeth glances at it. Last year's seventh grade raised $6000.
SCHOOL SECRETARY	You can't go in there. He's with a student. Elizabeth ignores her, adjusts her blouse, and enters. Principal Snur sits next to ARKADY, a small pale kid.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	If you don't like to get wet, Arkady, you could try using deodorant, anti-. perspirant, maybe some cologne. I know a lot of the older boys are wearing the body spray. Bodish spray. Elizabeth enters and immediately recoils from the smell.
ELIZABETH	Blugh! Arkady and Principal Snur both look up. He holds up his
PRINCIPAL SNUR	So why don't you think about that and I'll let your teachers know that you're working on it? Arkady nods and quickly exits.
ELIZABETH	Sorry, I didn't realize you were in with anyone.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	We were just finishing up. Elizabeth, I actually meant to talk to you. Did I hear that you were showing movies all last week?
ELIZABETH	Um... some clips, maybe. I think in a lot,
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Huh. Elizabeth tries a different tact. She picks up a dolphin-
ELIZABETH	Is this new? I love it! I think dolphins are smarter than humans.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Me too! And if you like that, you'll love this. Principal Snur pulls out an "Adopt-A-Dolphin"
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT`D)	He lives in the Cayman Islands.
ELIZABETH	What a great story. Principal Snur visibly relaxes. He's sitting across from
PRINCIPAL SNUR	So what else is new?
ELIZABETH	Actually, I was thinking that I want to get more involved.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	What a nice surprise.
ELIZABETH	Specifically, I thought I could supervise the car wash.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Amy's been running it the last two years...
ELIZABETH	She just does so much. It might be nice to give her a little rest. Especially that early on a Saturday.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	I'm so happy that you're dedicating yourself and becoming a real member of the JAMS family.
ELIZABETH	It just feels so good to help.
AMY	Elizabeth?! For the seventh grade carwash? That's bonkers! Amy immediately regrets saying "bonkers."
AMY (CONT'D)	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blow my stack.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	I just thought it was nice to see some other teachers step up.
AMY	We raised over $6000 last year. That's a record. Is this really the best time to start experimenting?
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Amy, I see you taking on a.lot of responsibility, what with directing "Annie" and all your work with D.A.R.E. I'd just hate to see you get overwhelmed like you did in 2004. She stares at him -- clearly, this is a touchy subject.
AMY	Of course. Well, I should skedaddle. Looks like someone needs to plan a Saturday morning bike ride. She turns on her heels and walks out.
GARRETT	Oh, I'm gonna get you guys! A couple of PARENT CHAPERONES stand in small clusters. Whoa. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Tristan's gaze. ELIZABETH steps out
ELIZABETH	Sorry I'm late.
MOTHER	I'm going to say something about her outfit. The MOTHERS vigorously nod in agreement. A DAD pipes in.
DAD	Well, if it helps raise money... The other DADS vigorously nod in agreement. --Elizabeth holds the "Carwash" sign. A LINE of CARS
VOICE (O.S.)	What are you doing? Elizabeth looks up and sees Sasha hiding behind a TRUCK,
ELIZABETH	Nothing. Get out of here, Dummy.
SASHA	Are you stealing our money?
ELIZABETH	How dare you?! I'm here early on a Saturday for you guys. And for the record, nobody likes a tattle tale.
SASHA	I haven't tattled. Yet.
ELIZABETH	Good. Cause if you do, I'll deny it and flunk your ass. How will that look on your resume? I didn't say I would say anything.
ELIZABETH	Alright then. Now beat it. I've gotta finish counting this money. Sasha walks off. Elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	See you Monday! Elizabeth waves to SASHA'S MOTHER, who eagerly waves
ANGLE ON	ANY, across the street, watching through binoculars.
AMY	Shishkebobs. She hesitates a beat and then enters. Amazing.
AMY (O.S.)	Wally? Are you in here? It's Amy Squirrel. He instinctively covers himself with the brochure.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Amy? What are you doing? Get out! Amy standing inside. She scrunches her nose at the smell.
AMY	This'll just take a sec. I thought you might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and Can we talk about this later?
AMY	"Later we'll all die, said the gator to the fly." Another TEACHER walks past Amy, looking confused. He
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said that the carwash was a huge success. And Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the kids had a great time.
AMY	I don't want to speak out of school, but I happened to be pedalling by and saw her get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And remember, we barely know anything about her. She was a real lone wolf last year.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling from the seventh grade car wash?
AMY	Something about this doesn't pass the smell test, Wally.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever she did worked. And next time you accuse a fellow teacher of stealing, you better be damn sure. We're done here. Amy takes a deep breath. Her face is BEET RED.
AMY	Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super day, you two. Amy exits. Immediately, there is an IMMENSE ERUPTION Christ... I thought she was never going to leave.
ELIZABETH	Hey! Are those new Doc Marten's? Guilty.
ELIZABETH	How's Period 5?
SANDY	Great, thanks for asking. We got a new bassist and we finally got a regular gig, which is nice because it's earned. It's time to show the world that a bunch of teachers can really rock out.
ELIZABETH	Awesome! Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt from the fridge? Sure thing. Sandy goes to the fridge. Elizabeth pulls visine from
SANDY (CONT'D)	You should come to one of our shows. He hands her the yogurt.
ELIZABETH	Oh, I can't. Elizabeth exits. Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee.
SANDY	I didn't even tell you the dates.
CHASE	Are we starting "School Ties" today? The camera ANGLES to show that she is studying a picture
ELIZABETH	Alright, today, we're starting "School Ties." Classic. You, shut off the lights. Elizabeth goes to the DVD player. There's a knock at the
SCHOOL SECRETARY	Here it is. Good luck.
ELIZABETH	Here what is?
SCHOOL SECRETARY	It's the pre-test for the state standardized test. It was in the memo.
ELIZABETH	Oh, yes. In the memo. The Secretary leaves. Elizabeth stares at the box.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Hey. Zip it. Zip your shit. Alright, look, we all know these tests are gay -- Elizabeth turns to a student who COULD BE GAY.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Hey. Elizabeth passes the box to the front of the class, where
ELIZABETH.(CONT'D)	According to this memo, I'm supposed to give you forty-five minutes per section. Blah blah blah. Clear your desks, pencils out and -- begin! Twenty-five pencils hit paper in unison. Elizabeth takes the TV and swivels it to face her desk. Chase and her friend walk right past the girl like she Little bitches.
TURN TO REVEAL	Elizabeth and Lynn on lunch duty. The girl at the table starts BAWLING. Amy, also on duty,
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	What a phony.
LYNN	Major phony. But she also cares a lot, too. So what's going on with your boobs?
ELIZABETH	Shit. Shit is going on with my boobs. I'm never gonna get married. I'm gonna die broke. I should just blow my brains out. There he is! Scott walks down the ramp and HIGH-FIVES a bunch of kids.
LYNN	I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.
ELIZABETH	I want to sit on his face.
SCOTT	Hey, guys.
ELIZABETH	You're really making a habit out of this.
SCOTT	Ha, yeah. Actually, Sandy Pinkus in the Math department, I guess he got that stomach bug that's been going around and I got the call.
LYNN	I heard he pooped himself in first period. A kid had to walk him to the nurse.
ELIZABETH	Lynn, would you mind grabbing me a milk? Elizabeth gives her a "can you get out of here?" look.
LYNN	Scott, do you want anything?
SCOTT	I'm good, thanks for asking. Lynn walks off.
ELIZABETH	So, Scott -- Lynn comes back.
LYNN	Sorry, what kind of milk do you want? Skim? Whole? 2%? Chocolate?
ELIZABETH	I don't know. Surprise me.
LYNN	Okay, I'll get you skim. No, no, 2%. Lynn walks off again.
ELIZABETH	She's funny. Elizabeth notices Amy looking at her as she continues to
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	So, Scott, I was thinking, I would love to hear about your experiences in the Peace Corps. I love Haiti. Maybe we could go grab a drink some night. Maybe tonight.
SCOTT	Isn't it Back-to-School Night?
ELIZABETH	Yeah, Silly, I meant after.
SCOTT	Cool! Let's get a group together.
ELIZABETH	Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us. Scott looks around, then lowers his voice.
SCOTT	Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered. You're one of the nicest people I've met here. But... I'm actually seeing someone.
ELIZABETH	Oh?
SCOTT	Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet.
ELIZABETH	Because she's ugly?
SCOTT	No. She's beautiful. She's great. She really cares about the kids. It's just... when you're dating a co-worker... Squirrel? Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a
SCOTT	Anyways, thanks again for asking me out. I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck on that group date. See ya! Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a
LYNN	Here you go. I got you one of each. Lynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them
ELIZABETH	Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey. Soooooo... Any questions? Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points
SASHA'S MOTHER	Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each other at the carwash. I'm a little concerned with the importance you're placing on movies. What about the state test? Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't
ELIZABETH	That's exactly what I say to my students. Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school hired me because I'm good at what I do. And the reason your son loves my class is because I inspire him. Movies are one tool that I use. I also use other multimedia techniques, which I'm not going to get into right now. Look, I could take you day by day through my entire syllabus, but that's not how I do things. I'm not one of these stuffy teachers who's totally by the book. I talk to the kids like they're little adults. It's about mutual respect. So that's my spiel, as the Jews say. Help yourselves to some delicious snacks and drinks in the back. Class dismissed. Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by
PARENT #1	Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. I'm Chris' dad. From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who
ELIZABETH	Chris... Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud.
CHRIS' DAD	Oh, what a relief. I just wish his grades would reflect it.
ELIZABETH	If I know Chris, he'll get there.
CHRIS' DAD	Listen, I know you have a full plate, but if you could keep an eye on Chris, my wife and I would really appreciate it. Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand, For supplies. Or whatever.
ELIZABETH	You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. The parents beam. A student like that would benefit so much from some extra attention.
CHASE'S MOM	You think we should hire a tutor? I told you. I'd be happy to do it myself. It's just hard in a class of twenty-five.
CHASE'S MOM	Oh, to be a teacher.
ELIZABETH	It's just so hard, on my salary, having to pay for my supplies, my fiance cheated on me with his twin sister... and, unlike a lot of these other teachers, all I truly care about is helping your child learn. And as their personal tutor, I guarantee a full grade higher -- or your money back.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Make it out to "cash." A Bohemian mother, MELODY, wearing a beret, lingers behind.
MELODY	Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Melody. Garrett's mom. Nice to meet you... Garrett's a great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud.
MELODY	Oh, you're referring to his poetry. Thank you.
ELIZABETH	You must be so proud.
MELODY	I am. So so so so so proud. So proud.
ELIZABETH	A kid like that, if I could just give some more one on one time, he would just blossom.
MELODY	I'm so happy to hear you say that. would really benefit from that.
ELIZABETH	Unfortunately, in a class of twenty- five...
MELODY	Ugh. Class sizes are ridiculous.
ELIZABETH	And with the amount they pay teachers...
MELODY	Thank god you love what you do.
ELIZABETH	I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you could help out by giving me a little -- you know -- somethin somethin. Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up. Melody stares back
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	It's just, it's really tough to teach the way that I want to teach when there's so little money. I mean, look at this place.
MELODY	You know what I'm going to do for you?
MELODY (CONT'D)	I am going to start a letter-writing campaign to the school board, to my congressman, to the mayor -- and keep writing until you get what you deserve.
MELODY (CONT'D)	And I'm writing myself a reminder! Melody pulls Elizabeth into a warm hug.
MELODY (CONT'D)	You are a saint. Melody exits. Elizabeth is left in the classroom by
ELIZABETH	So long, Crazy. As Elizabeth pulls out the CASH she just made, we hear
ELIZABETH	Enough with the commotion! The hallway goes silent. She comes back in and UNPAUSES
ELIZABETH	What do you want? Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth
SASHA	Is that marijuana?
ELIZABETH	It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave it to me. Not that it's any of your business.
SASHA	Oh, okay. Feel better. My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here. Sasha pulls out a tupperware container.
ELIZABETH	Are those oatmeal raisin?
SASHA	Sugar. Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window
ELIZABETH	You have anything to drink? Sasha shakes her head.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Word to the wise: stop dressing like you're running for congress.
SASHA	I don't want to run for congress. I want to be president.
ELIZABETH	See? That's what I'm talking about. Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna get punched. You really want to be President or is that what your parents tell to be? Sasha shrugs. You don't have to decide right now. Who knows? Maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus tips. Think about it.
SASHA	If I think about it, will I get extra credit?
ELIZABETH	Hopeless. Watch your feet. Elizabeth reverses. Sasha jumps away from the car. She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it. Once.
ELIZABETH	Seriously?
ELIZABETH	Seriously? She sees a HOMELESS GUY leaning against the storefront.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Why's the store closed? The Homeless Guy looks at her strangely.
HOMELESS GUY	It's Christmas.
ELIZABETH	Seriously? Elizabeth looks around. The streets are empty. Not a
HOMELESS GUY	Merry Christmas!
ELIZABETH	Whatever. Hey, you got a lighter?
HOMELESS GUY	I don't smoke. It's bad for you. Elizabeth walks back to her car, empty-handed. A MINI- The window rolls down. It's Garrett and his Mom.
GARRETT	Ms. Halsey! Hey, it's me, Garrett!
MELODY	Merry Christmas, Ms. Halsey!
MELODY	Having a nice Christmas? What are you doing the rest of the day? Going to see your family? I'm probably going to meet up with some people. We're having a big potluck, so... Elizabeth-shuffles her feet.
MELODY	Ms. Halsey. Elizabeth. Would you like to have Christmas with us?
MELODY	This is a real treat for Garrett. He doesn't have a lot of friends come by the house.
ELIZABETH	I find that hard to believe. Listen, I hate to eat and run, but I've gotta head over to the shelter.
GARRETT	I thought we could play board games!
AUNT #1	A shelter. That is so inspiring.
ELIZABETH	Yeah, I love helping bums.
MELODY	Oh, but you have to wait for dessert. We have a real treat.
ELIZABETH	If it's cheesecake, I'll stay.
MELODY	It's even better than cheesecake! Garrett, why don't you run and get some of your new poetry?
GARRETT	Oh god, no one wants to hear it. Oh god, I'm so embarrassed!
MELODY	Don't be shy, Marbles. Garrett runs out of the room.
ELIZABETH	If you're not really serving dessert, I'm gonna have to get going.
MELODY	One poem? If you like it, maybe you can read it to your homeless friends.
GARRETT	This is called "The Chase," by Garrett Tiara. XOXO /My love for you is XOXO/ Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it great? / About her smile / That I would walk a mile for / About her personality / That makes me see the best in me / And at night when we sleep / Our souls locked in deep / So that when we sleep / We can stop pretending / And embrace our beautiful ending. Melody applauds. The Aunts join in. Elizabeth claps,
ELIZABETH	She sits back down.
GARRETT	We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in romance perchance / One glance / One dance / Because together we can achieve... Ba-lance... Thank you. He closes his journal. Everyone applauds. Melody looks
ELIZABETH	Junior likes to rhyme.
MELODY	Patty, Nancy, why don't you give me a hand with dessert -- give them a chance to talk about the poem. The women exit, leaving Garrett and Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH	So your poem's about that girl?
GARRETT	Chase, yeah. You got the subtext.
ELIZABETH	Can I give you some advice?
GARRETT	Please.
ELIZABETH	Number one, stop writing poetry. Two: stop reading it. And three: don't set your sights so high. I mean, she's really hot. If I were you, I'd try for that chubby girl that sits up front -- the one with the teeth? Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in
GARRETT	But I like Chase.
ELIZABETH	Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot girl. Hotter, even. And I never would have gone out with a kid like you. And I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying it to be helpful.
GARRETT	What do you know? You don't-even know our names.
ELIZABETH	I'll tell you what I know: a kid who wears the same "Gymnastics" sweatshirt three days a week isn't getting laid until he's 26. That's what I know. This sweatshirt was my dad's. It's all he left when he left.
ELIZABETH	Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it.
GARRETT	Fuck you. Elizabeth pats Garrett on the shoulder.
ELIZABETH	Good luck being a loser. Thank your mom for dinner. Elizabeth heads for the door.
GARRETT	Happy New Year. Are you spending that alone, too, or do you want my mom to invite you over? She gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves. The kids look at each other, like "what is she doing?"
ELIZABETH	Shut up.
LYNN	Hey, welcome back.
ELIZABETH	What is that, vomit? Lynn grabs some towels and blots at the stain..
LYNN	Yeah, and a little blood. The kids had too much sugar. Anyways, a bunch of us are going out tonight to see Period 5 play. Do you want to come?
ELIZABETH	Ugh. No. Elizabeth heads out. Lynn, still blotting, follows her.
SCOTT	Hey, guys. Are you coming to 'In Cahoots' tonight? My band's doing a few songs. Could be fun.
ELIZABETH	Um, yes! That sounds like a party. Lynn, do you want to come?
LYNN	Yes.
SCOTT	We'll all grab a drink!
ELIZABETH	Great. I need to get drunk. I mean, not drunk drunk. But a strong buzz. Still be able to drive home.
SCOTT	Now we're cooking with grease! Amy, and a couple other teachers are front and_center, Everything's gonna be alright / rockabye... Scott joins in, harmonizing.
SCOTT	Rockabye, rockabye...
SANDY SCOTT	Bye, bye... Bye, bye...
ANGLE ON	Elizabeth and Lynn at the bar.
LYNN	Aren't they terrific? Elizabeth eye-fucks Scott. She catches his eye and he
ELIZABETH	They're perfect.
LYNN	You should hear some of their originals. She turns to the bartender.
ELIZABETH	Two more. You want anything?
LYNN	No thanks... You know, I was thinking that if you still need that money, you should.try and go for the bonus. Can't hurt.
ELIZABETH	What bonus?
LYNN	For the state test.
LYNN (CONT'D)	Whichever teacher has the highest scoring class gets a bonus. We talk about it all the time in the faculty meetings.
ELIZABETH	How much?
LYNN	$5700. Could be good, right? Let's dance! Lynn runs out onto the dance floor and joins Amy. Man it's a hot one / like seven inches from the midday sun... Amy kicks her shoes off, and starts dancing. Lynn Elizabeth throws back her drink and exits.
AMY	Cold. Elizabeth goes back to work. Let's go, Sylvia Plath. Garrett rolls his backpack over Elizabeth's shoe.. Where's the TV? Everyone, take your seats. Shawn turns to Spencer.
SHAWN	What do you think's going on? Spencer shrugs.
ELIZABETH	Come on, come on. We have a lot to cover so sit down. The class, still confused, quickly take their seats.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Alright then. Now. Open your To'Kill A Mockingbird to page one. The kids slowly take out their books. We HEAR the
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Good. Now, who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement? Anyone?
GARRETT	Because she's a cry baby. The kids chuckle. Chase looks back at Garrett. Get out. Garrett clicks up the handle on his bag and heads for the
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	We're here to learn. Anyone else have a problem with that? Good. So who has the answer to my question? Everyone looks down.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Nobody's read this book? It's on the syllabus.
SASHA	You never assigned it to us.
ELIZABETH	Well, now I am. And we're having a quiz tomorrow. Panic.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	On the first hundred pages.
SASHA	You can't do that! I have band and jazz band tonight!
SHAWN	We haven't had homework all year!
ELIZABETH	Hey! Zip your shit! We've fallen behind, and honestly, your practice tests scores sucked balls -- which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator. Things are about to change. Recess is over. Her roommate, Kirk, enters through the front door,
ELIZABETH	Did you get my Cool Ranch? He tosses her a bag of chips.
KIRK	You owe me two bucks.. Kirk walks into his room and closes the door.
ELIZABETH	Okay, now, what is the significance of the Mockingbird in the novel? What was Harper Lee trying to tell us? No one raises their hand. Come on, you guys know this. This is as close to real teaching as we've seen from
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Anyone else?
CHASE	It's a symbol for, um, equality? Elizabeth puts a sticker on Chase's forehead.
ELIZABETH	Okay, good. Can anyone add to what that girl said?
TRISTAN	Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the "facts," but come on, you know me. I'm Atticus Finch, baby! The class laughs.
TRISTAN (CONT'D)	Come on, seriously. You're gonna side with Chase and Shawn over me?
ELIZABETH	Use examples from the book.
SPENCER	It doesn't matter what race the defendant is. You've just gotta look at the facts-.
ELIZABETH	Good work today. And don't forget to leave your closing statements on my desk. Love the tie!
AMY	So, you know how I hate to gossip, but I heard that one of the custodians walked in on Omar -- you know, that Arabic boy -- giving... Oral sex to Matty Feldstein after swim practice in the boy's locker room.
SANDY	It just starts younger and younger. It's nice to finally see the Jews and the Arabs getting along. Elizabeth enters. Scott looks up and smiles.
SCOTT	Hey, Ms. Halsey.
AMY	Your shirt's mis-buttoned. Her shirt's mis-buttoned. Oh shit. Hold on. Elizabeth turns away from them and starts rebuttoning.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	I've just been such a mess the last few days. Working myself to the bone.
AMY	Yeah, it's been quite a change.
SCOTT.	Well, I think it's great. Some teachers just sail by, doing the bare minimum. It's good to know there are still some actual educators out there. Elizabeth smiles for Scott, like, "You get me."
ELIZABETH	Well, I should get going. Nice seeing all of you. Amy and Elizabeth smile thinly at one another. Elizabeth What a good egg.
AMY	What else, Sasha?
SASHA	I don't know. I told you about the car wash money.
AMY	I can't prove that. What else?
SASHA	I think I've told you everything.
AMY	And no more movies in class?
SASHA	No, we're actually learning. Did you know that Animal Farm isn't even really about animals -- Animal Farm?! That's not even on the syllabus! I know you're forgetting something. Do you want extra credit on your diorama or not?
SASHA	I want it! Let me think... Oh there was... never mind.
AMY	What?
SASHA	It was okay. It was medicinal.
AMY	Wait. Hold your horses. What was medicinal?
SASHA	Ms. Halsey was smoking in her car, but she told me her doctor prescribed it. Holy guacamole.
POLICE OFFICER #1	Come on, Axel, what do you smell, boy? The Police Officers continue the search. They lead the You better be right about this -- or I'm going to be getting a lot of panicked calls from parents.
AMY	Trust me, Wally. My kids in D.A.R.E. tell me everything and there are drugs in this school. And not just the students. Some of the female teachers.
TRISTAN (V.0.)	Atticus Finch is a good lawer because he's a good person whose a layer. Elizabeth looks at Tristan. As she writes, we HEAR --
ELIZABETH (V.0.)	Proofread. QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth grades another paper. She's
ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Wrong!!!
ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Is this English?
ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)	Are you fucking kidding me? Elizabeth crosses out with one line, so it's
SPENCER	Whoa. Drug dogs. Cool.
ELIZABETH	Sit down. Elizabeth races to the window.
ELIZABETH'S POV	The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Balls. She races back to her desk.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D	Keep reading. Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk, Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This will only take a second. Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs
ELIZABETH	Sorry. I had something caught in my throat. The German Shepherd continues barking.
POLICE OFFICER #1	What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy? The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go
GARRETT	Ahhh!!! The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag
POLICE OFFICER #1	All clear. Dog must've responded to these. Happens. Elizabeth glares at Amy -- "I know you were behind this." Principal Snur looks at Amy and shakes his head.
AMY	Even though that wasn't drugs, junk food is still contraband. That's detention, Buster.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call off this witch-hunt.
ELIZABETH	Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll excuse me, my class has a state test to prepare for. Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Whoa.
CHASE	Are you okay, Ms. Halsey? Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering.
ELIZABETH	Class dismissed.
SASHA	But the bell didn't ring.
ELIZABETH	Get out of my face. And leave the corn chips. The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	But first, a nap. She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of
ELIZABETH	Balls! She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground.
54 LAKEVIEW STREET	Peoria Il, 61602 Huh. Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it.
ELIZABETH (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)	Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey... Elizabeth is driving down the highway and smoking a joint.
ELIZABETH (V.0.)	Unfortunately, I can't make it in today. My grandmother took a turn for the worse and it looks like she's dead.
ELIZABETH (V.0.)	Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish me luck.
FRAT GUY	Hi there.
ELIZABETH	Is Tucker here? Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's here. So you coming to our "CEOs and Corporate Ho's" party tonight? Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away.
TUCKER	Do you ever talk to my brother?
ELIZABETH	No. He dumped me, remember?
TUCKER	You and my brother always had the histrionics. So, do you want to come to our party tonight? "CEOs and Corporate Ho's?" We're kinda light on Ho's.
ELIZABETH	Like I told "Frat Guy #1," I'm not interested.
TUCKER	Then what's up?
ELIZABETH	I need some date rape drugs.
TUCKER	Two things. Number one: who do you think I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah, I'm in an awesome frat, but that really hurts. And two: they're not "date rape" drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for weightlifting. It helps build mass, okay? Why do you even want it? For lifting. I have money and I'm in a rush. She takes out a wad of cash.
TUCKER	That's all you needed to say. No need to get all histrionic on me. Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a
TUCKER (CONT'D)	One capful makes you feel really good. Two capfuls will knock her out for a couple hours. You don't want to take any more than two. Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and
TUCKER (CONT'D)	Listen, I know you and my brother aren't together anymore, but I still think of you as a sister, okay?
ELIZABETH	Get your hand off my ass.
TUCKER	Sorry, didn't even know I put it down there. Good luck with your lifting.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	I.S.A.T. How can I direct your call?
ELIZABETH (O.S.)	Hi, my name is Marjorie Goodman and I'm calling from the Chicago Tribune. Who could I speak to regarding allegations of racial bias on your standardized tests? A beat.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)	Please hold.
CARL	Marjorie? "Marjorie" turns and we SEE that it's actually ELIZABETH,
ELIZABETH	You must be Carl. His face lights up, excited to be in the company of such
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Thanks for meeting me on such short notice. Elizabeth motions for him to sit down. You find the place alright? Good drive?
ELIZABETH	Great drive. I love downstate Illinois.
CARL	First time to Peoria?
ELIZABETH	Hmm mmm.
CARL	A lot of people don't know this, but it's the largest city on the Illinois River.
ELIZABETH	Wow. I did not know that.
CARL	Yup yup. And it was actually founded before Chicago.
ELIZABETH	Hello, Jeopardy! Have you ever auditioned?
CARL	No. I should, I should. Definitely thought about it.
ELIZABETH	Listen, I'd love to sit here and chat with you all night.
CARL	Yeah...
ELIZABETH	But I'm sure you're a very busy man, so I'll get right down to it. I've spoken to various, um, black citizens who are alleging that your tests are biased towards white people and Orientals.
CARL	You can't use my name, okay?
ELIZABETH	No problem.
CARL	Like I told you on the phone, every couple of years, we get calls from all over the state with these cockamamie charges. You should hear what they call me. And I'm not a racist. I voted for Obama. That, you can quote me on.
ELIZABETH	Oh, right. Elizabeth takes out a notebook and pen and starts jotting
CARL	Look, Marjorie, I know my tests aren't perfect. But what's the alternative? I'm all for free thinking and creativity, but how do you formulate an education budget without hard numbers from one of my tests?
ELIZABETH	You don't need to convince me. But you know what would help, Carl? For me to see one of this year's tests.
CARL	No problem at all. Elizabeth lights up. I'll send you one the day after the schools administer them.
ELIZABETH	I'd really love to see it sooner. I'm on a bit of a deadline.
CARL	I wish I could, but unfortunately, you need one of these bad boys. Carl holds up a lanyard with a STATE ID CARD and some
ELIZABETH	Ooh, you look like you're CIA. Listen, I totally get it. Enough business for one night. I'm gonna have another drink before I hit the road. What's your poison?
CARL	My poison is the white devil. Wine. White wine.
ELIZABETH	Fantastic. One white wine, one tequila sunrise, and two shots of tequila.
CARL	You know, Marjorie, this is the best night I've had in a longtime.
ELIZABETH	Well, that makes two of us. Elizabeth gives Carl "fuck me" eyes. He nervously sips What turns you on, Carl?
CARL	Everything.
ELIZABETH	You know what turns me on, Carl? He giggles nervously. Sex in an office. Getting fucked really, really hard against a wooden desk. Mine's metal.
ELIZABETH	Even better.
CARL	So this is the desk.
ELIZABETH	Do you have anything to drink? Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	White wine in the office. You're a bad boy. Carl pours a glass. Elizabeth swigs from the bottle.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Do you have any music?
CARL	Um... I could put on some internet radio.
ELIZABETH	A toast. To new friends.
CARL	To new lovers. CLINK. Carl downs his glass. I'm gonna take off my shoes. Is that okay?
ELIZABETH	Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's room.
CARL	K, first door on your right. Don't be long. Carl starts carefully clearing everything off of his desk. I wanna fug ya agains dis desk.
ELIZABETH	Easy, Cowboy. Carl stumbles towards her. Elizabeth deftly moves around
CARL	Marblorie!
ELIZABETH	Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out. Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	And bingo was his name-o. She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. He
ELIZABETH	Okay, go. The students open their test books and start. Twenty-
ELIZABETH	Okay, pencils down. A couple of groans. A couple of frantic moves to fill in
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Come on, come on. It doesn't even matter. Bring your tests up. The students dutifully place their tests into a neat She then reaches into her bag and pulls out a new stack Principal Snur is on stage. All the teachers sit in the
AMY	If anyone has any information regarding the whereabouts of the missing "Annie" wig, please let me know ASAP. Because if that wig isn't found, you can bet your bottom dollar the "sun will not come out tomorrow." Back to you, Wally. Amy sits. Principal Snur addresses the teachers.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Thanks, Amy. Um, okay, I'm sure everyone wants to go home, so I'll be quick. Fourscore and seven years ago... Scattered laughter. Elizabeth rolls her eyes.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	So I have here the results of the state exam -- and I'm happy to announce that John Adams Middle School had the fifth highest scores in the state. The Teachers applaud.
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)	And I want to single out one of our own, who showed that with hard work and dedication, one person can make a difference. She makes me proud to be her boss and she's now $5700 richer. With the highest scores in the county -- yes, you heard me right, in the county ---I want everyone to please give a hand to --
AMY	Oh boy, third year in a row. This is starting to get embarrassing.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Elizabeth Halsey! Elizabeth leans over to Amy, who's sitting beside her.
ELIZABETH	This is unexpected. All of the color drains from Amy's face as Elizabeth
SCOTT	Hey, if it isn't Professor Smartypants. Scott playfully punches her shoulder. Elizabeth Better not mess with me. I'm a lot stronger than I look. So what are you gonna do with your new- found riches?
ELIZABETH	Something big. Maybe two big things. Amy walks up and gives Elizabeth a big, fake hug.
AMY	Hey! Ism so proud of you. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that you -- you! -- would get the bonus, I would've said to whomever it was, 'you must be joshing me.' And now, here we are. Here we are.
SCOTT	We should go out and celebrate. Your treat?
AMY	What a good, fun idea. Unfortunately, Scott and I have to go over the itinerary for the D.C. trip. We're the chaperones. We're going together. We're dating, so it'll also be romantic. You're not dating anyone now, right?
ELIZABETH	I've got my eye on someone, but he's dating a major cunt. Pardon my French.
SCOTT	No, she sounds terrible.
ELIZABETH	She is.
AMY	Well then. Scott, we should skedaddle. Those itineraries won't schedule themselves. Amy and Scott head off. Scott turns around.
SCOTT	Rain check on those drinks. You can bet on it.
DANNI	Almost done. We don't normally deal with cash here. At the doctor's office. Elizabeth slides the bonus check across the desk.
ELIZABETH	And this is endorsed. And the rest you can put on these. Elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk. The And when would you like to come in?
MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR	Hi. He goes into his office. Elizabeth turns back to Danni.
DANNI	And when would you like to come in?
ELIZABETH	Today. Tomorrow. As soon as possible. Danni checks her calendar.
DANNI	A week from tomorrow, then?
ELIZABETH	Book it. Danni slides Elizabeth a packet of literature.
DANNI	We have a 48 hour cancellation policy. Anything after that, you'll be charged 50% the cost of the surgery -- unless there are extenuating circumstances.
ELIZABETH	I wouldn't miss it for the world. Elizabeth pulls her shirt away from her body and looks
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	So long, suckers. Then she pulls out POISON IVY. She rubs the apple with The class stares back at her blankly.
AMY (CONT'D)	Who did this? No response from the class.
AMY (CONT'D)	Oh come on. Nobody wants an extra sticker on their all-star board? Amy presses the apple to her ear. Who brought you to me? Amy places the apple up to her ear. What's that, Mr. Apple? You want me to take a bite? Alrighty-roo. Amy takes a bite of the apple and then addresses the class.
AMY (CONT'D)	Enough horsin' around, let's get started.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	All set?
SCOTT	I think we're good.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Elizabeth, thanks again for hopping in last minute. You really saved us.
ELIZABETH	Is Amy going to be okay?
PRINCIPAL SNUR	She'll be fine. But to be honest, I think she was scaring some of the kids.
ELIZABETH	I bet, I bet. Well, let her know she's in my thoughts.
ANGLE ON	Amy watching from outside her car. One side of her face Fudge! Fudge! Fudge! Fuuuuuck--dge! Hey, Sasha! Hey, Sasha!
SASHA	I think I hear it again!
KIDS	You're wanted on the telephone! If it's not Chase, then I'm not home! Chase rolls her eyes. Up front, Scott and Elizabeth sit
ELIZABETH	You guys are amazing. Period 5 is definitely going to make it. Scott smiles wide. Garrett walks up the aisle. He looks
GARRETT	Mr. Delacourte, do you think we could go to the poetry museum?
SCOTT	Oh, um, I don't know, Champ, um -- Scott looks to Elizabeth, like "please help."
ELIZABETH	Oh, honey, I bet everyone would just love to walk around and look at all the poetry itinerary's really tight.
GARRETT	Why are you talking like that?
ELIZABETH	Just go sit down, sweetie. Garrett gives her an annoyed look and then heads back to
SCOTT	Wow, you are such a natural.
ELIZABETH	When you love what you do, it comes easy. Shishkebabs!
AMY	I never lose my keys!
MAINTENANCE GUY	What's wrong with your face?
AMY	What's wrong with your face?!?!
MAINTENANCE GUY	Just making conversation. He finds the right key and opens the desk.
MAINTENANCE GUY (CONT'D)	All set.
AMY	Super! Thanks a bunch, Amos! The Maintenance Man exits. Amy immediately opens the desk and rummages through it.
AMY (CONT'D)	Busted. She pulls out a test booklet. There's a piece ripped out
AMY (CONT'D)	Looks like somebody's in big, big trouble.
SCOTT	Alright, guys, count-off. The students begin their count-off. He bumps knuckles with his friend. As the students continue counting off, we D.C. Montage: --Elizabeth and Scott walk with the kids through --Chase has Elizabeth take a "Charlie's Angels" posed
CARL	She changed her hair. Is Marjorie in some kind of trouble?
AMY	I think you're the one that might be in some kind of trouble! Did you or did you not give her a copy of the state test?
CARL	What?! No! All I did was give her a couple of quotes ,for her article and that's it.
AMY	What article?
CARL	For the Tribune. She's a reporter there. Right? Amy's eyes go wide.
GARRETT	Hey, you want me to take your picture?
CHASE	No.
GARRETT	Alright, well let me know. I've got my camera and my battery's fully charged. She turns away.
GARRETT (CONT'D)	Awesome. .Scott, who stares up at the memorial and looks choked up. Fruit roll-up? I'm so conflicted about this man. Did you know that he had slaves? Elizabeth tries to dislodge a piece of the fruit roll-up
ELIZABETH	Yeah, everyone knows that.
SCOTT	I just hate slavery so, so much. An unquestionable evil. I hate it. Elizabeth continues struggling with the fruit.
ELIZABETH	Slavery's the worst.
SCOTT	If I could go back in time and undo slavery, I would. Elizabeth gives him a sideways glance, like "no shit."
ELIZABETH	You really hate slavery, huh?
SCOTT	I hate it. Elizabeth finally dislodges the chunk of fruit roll-up.
ELIZABETH	Got it.
SCOTT	You get it. Scott squeezes Elizabeth's shoulder.
SCOTT (CONT'D)	Thanks for listening.
ELIZABETH	Hey, I want you to know you can talk to me about anything. Slavery, the Holocaust, relationships. Scott smiles. Elizabeth smiles. They lock eyes -- a
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Test-tampering. Here? At J.A.M.S.?
AMY	And like I said, she stole the wig. I think we're dealing with a criminal master-mind. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, Wally. You know how much we all like her.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	I know. It's a tragedy. But Amy, let's keep this between us. The last thing we need is a scandal on our hands.
AMY	You betcha. You know what scares me the most? This is just what we know. This could be the tip of the iceberg. Who knows what else she's capable of?
SCOTT	Oh my gosh, your body feels so good.
ELIZABETH	Harder, harder. Elizabeth tries pulling off her shirt. Scott pulls it
SCOTT	Oh my gosh, I'm dry-humping the shit out of you.
ELIZABETH	Erg. Dry fuck the fuck out of me.
SCOTT	Oh my gosh, I'm so close... I'm... pfft. Ugh. Scott rolls off of Elizabeth and exhales deeply. There's
SCOTT (CONT'D)	That was a mistake.
ELIZABETH	That was fast.
SCOTT	I know, I'm sorry. But this isn't me. And I. know this isn't you. I'm in love with Amy.
ELIZABETH	But we're so good together. We both hate slavery, we both love teaching. And call me crazy, but I always imagined us spending summers at your family's compound in Hyannisport.
SCOTT	I know. And you're awesome and you have a huge heart and I love your empathy. It's just, when I was dry-humping you, I couldn't stop thinking about dry-humping Any.
ELIZABETH	It's because of my tits, isn't it? Well, I'm getting new ones in, like, two days. Don't make a decision until you see them.
SCOTT	Elizabeth, I think you're beautiful just the way you are, even with your flat chest. And I think Amy's beautiful. But I just have to do what's right. I made Amy a promise. Scott holds up his hand, showing off a PROMISE RING.
ELIZABETH	What're you -- 13? Elizabeth angrily gets up and pulls on her socks.
SCOTT	Wait, Elizabeth. Don't go. Spend the night here with me. You can sleep on the other bed. Ooh, like a slumber party? I'm leaving. And for the record, your band sucks, asstard. Wally. Why would I cheat? If I'm guilty of anything, it's teaching too hard. Great... I've got nothing to hide. She ends the call.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Fuck! Scott, wearing a Thomas Jefferson souvenir T-shirt, and
ELIZABETH.(CONT'D)	What?! The Tour Guide looks around uncertainly before continuing.
TOUR GUIDE	And does anyone know what Abraham Lincoln's nickname was? Sasha's hand shoots up.
SASHA	Honest Abe.
TOUR GUIDE	"Honest Abe", that's right. Because Lincoln always said what was on his mind, even if that meant being unpopular. Abraham Lincoln always showed great courage. Garrett takes this in. He looks over at Chase and then,
TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)	Yes?
GARRETT	I love Chase Streeter-Rossi. All eyes turn to Garrett. Chase looks mortified.
TOUR GUIDE	Okay then. Any other questions?
GARRETT	I love you, Chase. I've always loved you. And even though you pretty much stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I don't care. I remember the Chase that wrote me a card when my dad was overweight and had to go to the hospital because of his heart --
SASHA	That was from the whole class.
GARRETT	Shut up, Sasha, I'm talking about a different card. And then, a year later, when he left my mom and moved in with his trainer, you wrote me another card. What happened to us? Remember when we had a sleepover in the second grade and you wet your bed and you were so embarrassed and you made me promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I never did and I never will. I know we're really young, but remember Romeo and Juliet were only 13. A lot of people don't know that. So there it is. My heart on a sleeve. Don't let me leave / Always believe / A beat. Chase stares at Garrett.
CHASE	Gross. Chase's friends all start laughing. The rest of the
SCOTT	Alright, guys, let's settle down. The Tour Guide looks around, uncertain. And these columns here are Doric columns. Now let's move inside to see the interior murals painted by Jules Guerin. The Tour Guide leads the group inside. Elizabeth looks
ELIZABETH	Hey, Abe Lincoln, get up. Tour's not over. She just laughed at me. Called me gross.
ELIZABETH	You'll get over it. Get up.
GARRETT	I'm not going back. Leave me alone!
ELIZABETH	Now.
GARRETT	No! Garrett runs off.
ELIZABETH	Hey, come back here you little -- Elizabeth starts running after him in heels. She She breaks the other heel.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Fucker.
SCOTT	Who had a good time in D.C.? The students let out a cheer. Who ate too many french fries at lunch? The students let out another cheer. Alright, let's do our final count-off.
TRISTAN	A beat.
,SCOTT	Wait, wait. Where's 5? Who's 5? Everyone looks around.
SASHA	I think it's Garrett Tiara.
SCOTT	Garrett! Garrett! Nothing. Scott looks around, stricken. And where's Ms. Halsey? Nothing. Alright, everyone on the bus!
ELIZABETH	Garrett! Garrett! Her cell phone RINGS. She checks the caller ID: "HOT Let's go home! Let's go home! Scott sits up front by the driver. He's on his cell. I'm freaking out here. They've been missing over two hours. I'm just a substitute! Shut up!!! The chanting immediately stops. Oh my gosh. We just might have a Mary Kay Letourneau situation on our hands. Amy scratches the turtle's neck as it continues across
SCOTT	I don't know. You think?
AMY	I know. The woman's a criminal mastermind.
SCOTT	This is such a mess. What I need from you is to focus and get our kids home safe. I'll take care of everything here.
SCOTT	Thanks, Amy. You're a lifesaver.
AMY	It's what I do. Love you, Scooter. She hangs up the phone and cockily kicks her feet onto
AMY (CONT'D)	Oh boy. Garrett! Garrett! Her phone RINGS. She checks the CALLER ID -- "HOT SCOTT." I'm looking for him! Stop fucking calling me! She powers her phone off and continues down the street.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Hey, guys. Hi. I'm looking for a young kid, about 13. Really annoying, kind of a cry baby. Have you seen him?
PROSTITUTE #1	Fuck you.
ELIZABETH	Fantastic.
PROSTITUTE #2	You best step off, bitch, because this is my block. This here's Poetry's block.
ELIZABETH	Poetry?
PROSTITUTE #1	Cause that's how she fuck.
PROSTITUTE #2	I fuck like that. Lyrical. Something occurs to Elizabeth. She smiles.
ELIZABETH	Thank you, Poetry. And Poetry's friend.
HOMELESS MAN #1	Won't get a cab in this neighborhood. A CAR slows next to Elizabeth. A JOHN rolls down the
JOHN	Hey, sweetheart. How much for a titty fuck?
ELIZABETH	I need a ride.
JOHN	Oh yeah, I need a ride, too. Right through those titties.
ELIZABETH	No, I need a ride. Like you driving, and me pointing mace at your face. I'll give you ten bucks. This is weird. Twenty. Elizabeth hops in. He's gonna be alright. The police will find him. I'm sure they're back at the hotel. Probably just a mix-up. The bus pulls up to the curb and stops. Scott steps off
REPORTER	What can you. tell us about the alleged romance between Elizabeth Halsey and a 13 year old student? What? The students step off and the Parents swarm them.
PARENT #1	Oh baby, are you okay? Did she touch you? Sasha's parents engulf her in a hug.
SASHA'S MOTHER	Oh Sasha! You expect this stuff to happen in Florida, not here.
ELIZABETH	It's closed. Won't be open till morning. Come on. Let's get back to the hotel. I'm sure everyone's mad at you. Garrett stands his ground.
GARRETT	I'm not leaving without talking to the poet laureate.
ELIZABETH	Do you think that some Shel Silverstein wannabe is going to tell you the meaning of life?
GARRETT	What do you care?
ELIZABETH	I'm here, right?
GARRETT	You have to be here. You're a teacher.
ELIZABETH	Not for long. I'm getting fired for cheating as soon as we get back. Garrett takes a seat next to Elizabeth.
GARRETT	So. you came looking for me on your own?
ELIZABETH	Yup. And you owe me a new pair of Nanette Lepores.
GARRETT	I just want to know what to say to Chase to get her to like me.
ELIZABETH	You know what you should do?
ELIZABETH	Just go out and sleep with as many girls, as you possibly can. Get her out of your head.
GARRETT	They'll probably reject me, too.
ELIZABETH	Yeah, probably. But life's about how you deal with rejection. You can either hide in a corner and cry or you can get stronger every time. And I figure a kid like you with not much going for him -- if he were to choose the latter -- might end up becoming a pretty strong man. Thanks.
ELIZABETH	Now come on, let's get out of here. I'm freezing and Mr. Delacourte's probably shitting a brick.
GARRETT	I can't go back there. All the kids will laugh at me.
ELIZABETH	You seriously think they haven't been laughing already?
GARRETT	Maybe Chase is wondering where I am.
ELIZABETH	Hate to break it to you, kid, but I don't think anyone gives two shits where we are.
DETECTIVE	What else can you tell us about Garrett and Ms. Halsey's relationship?
MELODY	It was strictly student/teacher. Garrett's a gifted poet and Ms. Halsey was trying to bring that out of him. Amy snorts.
DETECTIVE	Did they ever spend time outside of the classroom?
MELODY	Aside from Christmas at our house? Absolutely not. The Detective glances at the Principal, like "Oh boy."
AMY	She used to give all the guys that look. That sex look. You know -- Amy gives her version of a sexy look to the Detective.
AMY (CONT'D)	She's a monster.
DETECTIVE	Mrs. Tiara, I think we might need to consider the possibility that Elizabeth Halsey has abducted your son and that the two of them are involved in a sexual relationship. Marbles doesn't even have armpit hair!
DETECTIVE	We should send out an Amber Alert. We need to catch this Sicko.
TV NEWS FOOTAGE	A REPORTER talks to camera on the steps of J.A.M.S.
REPORTER	A school official close to the scandal confirms that in addition to her alleged sexual relationship with the unnamed seventh grader, Elizabeth Halsey has been investigated for possible drug use, standardized testing fraud, and the theft of an "Annie" wig from a school production. The TV Report flashes an unflattering photo of ELIZABETH In front of the school, the Reporter turns to Principal Snur.
REPORTER (CONT'D)	Can you comment on any of these allegations?
PRINCIPAL SNUR	The superintendent will speak to the press shortly, but for now, I'd just like to say that I hope Ms. Halsey does the right thing and brings back our student. You're paying me back for this.
MARK	Am I shocked? Mark starts laughing.
SHEILA	She was always very cold to me.
CHASE	Garrett sat diagonal from me in language arts. He was always so supportive of my modelling career. She's my best friend. She tells me everything. We have lunch together!
TRISTAN	I've been telling him to hit that all year. That's my boy!
AMY	"No child left behind." How ironic. That a child was left behind. In Washington, D.C. With a statutory rapist. Elizabeth is asleep on Garrett's shoulder. Garrett is
GARRETT	Hey, there's a bunch of people outside of my house. Elizabeth wakes up and looks up to see:
ELIZABETH	What the fuck? Did you steal something? The taxi pulls up to the curb and Elizabeth and Garrett .exit. Marbles!!! The reporters thrust mics in her face.
REPORTER #1 REPORTER #2	How long have you been Why did you steal the sleeping together? "Annie" wig?!
ELIZABETH ,	Just the once on the train. What?! The Cops get through and smother Garrett in a police
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	This is crazy! He's a kid. Elizabeth is put into the back of squad car.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	I'm a good person! I don't fuck minors!
SERGEANT	You're quite the celebrity.
ELIZABETH	You want an autograph?
SERGEANT	You get one call. Elizabeth picks up the phone. The Sergeant gives her Hi, this is Elizabeth Halsey calling. I'm calling to cancel my surgery for tomorrow. Extenuating circumstances. Please, please don't make me lose my deposit. Elizabeth slams down the receiver.
SERGEANT	If you need medical attention, we're required to provide it.
ELIZABETH	Just take me back to my cell.
Silence.	Elizabeth and her roommate, Kirk, who's now dressed in an
PRINCIPAL SNUR	Again, speaking on behalf of the whole administration, I just want to apologize for what happened. Clearly, there was a miscommunication.
ELIZABETH	Oh, you think? Kirk puts his hand up to Elizabeth, like "I'll take care
KIRK	My client has been an upstanding member of society her entire life. She has spent time as an educator, she has
ELIZABETH	More than once!
KIRK	And she has touched the lives of those around her -- until last night. Elizabeth pulls Kirk into a lawyer/client huddle. You kind of sound like a pro. Do you think they're going to find out that I didn't pass the bar? You're doing great. They break from their huddle.
KIRK	Your administration jumped to conclusions, set off a media fire-storm and has humiliated one of its own. As Ms. .Halsey's chief counsel, I've advised her that we have an extremely strong case of libel and that it's certainly within her province to sue the district.
SUPERINTENDENT	How do we make this go away?
KIRK	Ms. Halsey is not a litigious woman. She wants this whole matter to go away as quickly and painlessly as possible.
KIRK (CONT'D)	This is a list of our demands. The Superintendent and Principal Snur scan the list.
SUPERINTENDENT	You're kidding me.
ELIZABETH	Don't answer right now. Let it marinate. Oh, and I should mention that if this goes to trial, I can cry on cue. Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be heading to fifth period. I hate to be tardy. Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song.
AMY	Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave us quite a scare, you did. Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking
AMY (CONT'D)	Somebody's being a grumple-- BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops
AMY (CONT'D)	Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)	Well, it's been another great year at
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)	Who can forget the exciting addition of a climbing wall to the small gym...
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)	.Or the student/teacher spelling bee.
PRINCIPAL SNUR	I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s. Polite laughter. But seriously... With summer around the corner, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to one of our own. Elizabeth smiles.
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)	Amy Squirrel. Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a After six short years of outstanding, tireless work here, Amy is transferring out of the district. I know she'll bring her love for learning to her new students. Sandy, the ponytailed teacher, pipes up.
SANDY	Speech! Speech!
AMY	Although leaving was a difficult choice... Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to
AMY (CONT'D)	When the superintendent personally asks you to work at one of the worst schools in the state, you say yes. I'm looking forward to bringing my brand of zany energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for learning to the underprivileged students at Malcolm X High. I welcome the challenge. The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic.
ELIZABETH	Here, I got you this. Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it.
SCOTT	Hey, Stranger. Listen, now that Amy's transferring, maybe the two of us could go grab a drink. Elizabeth walks out. Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed The bell RINGS. Elizabeth turns and we now SEE that she has TASTEFUL FAKE Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders.
EIGHTH GRADE BOY	Do me! Do me! Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles.
ELIZABETH	You and Chase, huh? She likes the poetry?
GARRETT	She likes that I'm kind of a celebrity. But I'm cool with it. I'm the man around here!
ELIZABETH	Easy.
GARRETT	Well, I should get going. See you around, Ms. Halsey. Oh, and nice... He points at her breasts. Thanks! You're the first student to notice. Garrett smiles and walks off. Lynn walks by. She's
LYNN	Elizabeth, hey! How was your summer?
ELIZABETH	It was great. I met a doctor! Plastic surgeon, actually. He's amazing.
LYNN	He sounds amazing. How'd you meet him? The internet?
ELIZABETH	No, in recovery. And I looked like ass, so I know it's real.
LYNN	Sounds like a fairy tale.
ELIZABETH	It is. Storybook. Well, not total storybook. It's a little messy because his wife filed for divorce last week, but we're gonna get through that. So you want to grab lunch later?
LYNN	Sure! My treat.
ELIZABETH	No, you got it last time. We'll split it.
