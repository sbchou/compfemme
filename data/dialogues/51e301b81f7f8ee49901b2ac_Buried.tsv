In What is this? With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened He lights the Zippo to get a better look. He frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too He is soon able to reach it.

PAUL	No! Wait! Paul accidentally bangs the cap of the Zippo against the She quickly returns.
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	911. What is your emergency?
PAUL	Hello?
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	911. What's the problem, sir? Paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining

PAUL	A cell phone. There was an old cell phone in the coffin.

PAUL	Yes. No. It's not mine, but yes, I'm calling from a cell phone.
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	There was a cell phone in the coffin when you climbed in?
PAUL	I didn't climb in.
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	How did you end up in the coffin, sir?
PAUL	I was put here.
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	In the coffin?
PAUL	Yes. Please send help. And you're saying the coffin is buried?

FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	Iraq?
PAUL	Yes. I'm a truck driver, an American. I work for CRT.
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	Are you a soldier, sir?
PAUL	No. Please, please listen to me. I'm a truck driver. I work for CRT. I'm a civilian contractor working in Iraq. We were attacked in Baqubah, they...they... ...shot them. All of them.
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	They shot who, sir?
PAUL	All of the other drivers.
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	And you're saying this happened in Iraq? The country?
PAUL	Yes. Please, you have to help me. They gave me a safety number to call, but I had it stored in my wallet and -- Mister Conroy, this is 911 emergency in Youngstown, Ohio.
PAUL	Ohio?
FEMALE 911 OPERATOR	Yes, sir. I'm not sure exactly how you called here if you're in another country, but if you'd like, I can patch you through to the Sheriff's Department.
PAUL	Sheriff's Department? No...you don't underst... ...forget it. Realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless, He immediately dials another number, one that he can recall He again enters the 001 international code before making the Paul then dials his home phone. It rings several times, so
PAUL	Come on, come on. Pick up. Please. After sitting through the agony of a few more rings, Paul is

PAUL	Linda, honey, it's me. Listen, I Guard right away. Or the Pentagon. Tell them we were attacked in the Diyala Provence, in Baqubah.
PAUL (CONT'D)	They have to find me. Please help me, baby. Please help them find me. Paul hangs up. He dials his wife's cell phone right away.
LINDA	Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message. Thanks and have a great day. The Beep sounds and Paul immediately tears into his voice Linda, it's Paul. I need you to call me right away. This is an absolute emergency. Call the number that comes up on your phone. Call me at that number. If I don't answer, call the Pentagon or the F.B.I. I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm buried in a box... Hearing himself say those last words gives him pause. The

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Chicago field office. Special Agent Harris.
PAUL	Hello? Is this the F.B.I.?
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Yes it is, sir.
PAUL	I'm calling from Iraq. I'm buried in the desert somewhere. I need you to help me --
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Whoa, whoa, sir. Slow down. When were you in Iraq?
PAUL	Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck driver for CRT. I've been here for nine months.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	May I have your name please, sir?
PAUL	Paul Conroy.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Paul Conroy. Okay, Paul, explain to me what's going on. Paul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately
PAUL	Alright. Me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering kitchen parts to a community center. As we got closer, a bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks. Then an IED went off up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks. These guys came out from behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there on the street.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Were you shot at?
PAUL	I don't know! I don't know. I was way in the back of the convoy. I must have got hit in the head with one of the rocks and got knocked out. That's the last thing I remember. But now I just woke up, and I was tied up and buried in a coffin.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Who put you there?
PAUL	I guess whoever ambushed us.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	A bunch of kids?
PAUL	No, you're not listening. The kids threw the rocks at us, but then some Iraqi guys -- maybe insurgents, I don't fucking know -- popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	I thought you said they didn't shoot at you.
PAUL	They didn't, I don't know! But they shot them!
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Sir, you're going to have to stop shouting if --
PAUL	I'm shouting because you're not listening! I need you to help me! Please!!
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Hmmm... Paul takes a moment to center himself.
PAUL	Can you trace my call? GPS or something?
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Why is it that they didn't shoot you?
PAUL	I have no idea. They didn't, that's all I know.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	What's your social security number, Paul?
PAUL	Why? Who cares? I'm buried in the middle of the fucking desert! Who cares what my social security number is?! I'm an American citizen. Just send someone to find me!
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Do you know where you're ...lo...if...dy.. The cell phone starts breaking up.
PAUL	Hello? What? I can't hear you.
SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS	Bet...un...near...
PAUL	Hello?! Hello?! Paul checks the phone's display, where he sees that the call
PAUL (CONT'D)	Shit!! Cell phone service temporarily goes down. Paul lights the He shakes the phone, moves it around the coffin, all in
CRT OPERATOR	Thank you for calling Crestin, Roland and Thomas. How may I direct your call?
PAUL	Somebody, I need to talk to someone right away. It's an emergency.
CRT OPERATOR	Who is this, please?
PAUL	Paul Conroy. I'm a driver for you guys. I'm calling from Iraq. My convoy was attacked.
CRT OPERATOR	Sir, if this is a crisis situation you need to contact the Safety Number your were provided.
PAUL	I know, I know, but I don't have it. They took it.
CRT OPERATOR	Who took it, sir?
PAUL	The Iraqis, I think. I don't remember, I blacked out.
CRT OPERATOR	I'm going to put you through to Alan Davenport.
PAUL	Davenport? Who's that?
CRT OPERATOR	Director of Personnel. Please hold.
PAUL	Personnel? No, I need to talk -- Paul is placed on hold. Synthesized soft rock plays in the
CRT SPOKESMAN	At CRT, we work with our clients to provide effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges they face in our fast-growing, global economy. As the premiere...
ALAN DAVENPORT	You've reached Alan Davenport, personnel director at Crestin, Roland and Thomas. Please leave your name and number at the tone and I will return your call as soon as possible. The BEEP sounds. Paul is confused as to why he was patched
PAUL	This is Paul Conroy, I'm from Hastings, Michigan. I'm a driver for CRT, and my convoy was ambushed...by insurgents or terrorists. I don't know. I don't know who it was. I'm stuck in the ground, buried in a coffin and I need help. Please send help. I'm begging you. I think I'm in Baqubah in the Diyala Provence. Please send help right away. I can't breathe in here. I can't...please. I'm begging you. I don't know who else to call. ...fuck. Paul drops the phone to his side, the screen still emitting He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear. He screams and The coffin returns to pitch black. After a long beat, Paul lights the Zippo, which remains Using his click-up pencil, he scribbles the numbers onto the It rings once. A second ring. In the middle of the third
PAUL	Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? After a beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of the
PAUL (CONT'D)	Hello? Who are you? Please, you have to help me. Still, Paul's words are only met with slow, measured breaths.
PAUL (CONT'D)	Who is this? Hello? The person on the other end eventually speaks. An Iraqi man,
JABIR	Breathe no breathe, American? Ah? Breathe no breathe?
PAUL	What? I don't know what you're saying. Who is this?
JABIR	American can breathe no breathe?
PAUL	No, I can't breathe. Please get me out of here.
JABIR	Get out?
PAUL	Yes, please get me out. Help me.
JABIR	Soldier.
PAUL	No, no I'm not a soldier. I'm a truck driver. That's it. I'm not a soldier. I'm a contractor.
JABIR	Contractor?
PAUL	Yes, that's right. A contractor. Not a soldier.
JABIR	Blackwater.
PAUL	No, not for Blackwater. I'm not a security contractor. Truck driver, I'm a truck driver. That's all.
JABIR	You are American.
PAUL	Yes.
JABIR	Then you are soldier. Despair falls upon Paul. It becomes clear that Jabir is
PAUL	No, I'm not. I'm here unarmed. But, you still shot at us.
JABIR	In head and in throat, so you tell no more lies.
PAUL	I'm not lying! We were all drivers.
JABIR	Drive what?
PAUL	Trucks. The big trucks you see driving around with the supplies? That's us. That's me. We're not soldiers.
JABIR	Five million money.
PAUL	What?
JABIR	Five million money tonight by nine PM or you stay. Buried like dog.
PAUL	Five million dollars? From who?
JABIR	Your family.
PAUL	My family doesn't have five million dollars. If they did, I wouldn't be here.
JABIR	From Embassy.
PAUL	I don't know, yes, the Embassy will pay you. If you let me go, they'll pay you the money. Silence on the other end of the phone.
JABIR	Nine PM, five million money. Jabir hangs up the phone, forcing Paul to instantly come to With his hands now free, Paul haphazardly positions himself Paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest, with his Trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin, Staring ahead, the phone sits in front of him. He notices He grabs the cell phone, staring at it, trying to think of The battery life is limited. Every call has to count. Come on, what's her number? A second later, we see him, lit by the cell phone display A MALE 411 OPERATOR answers. What city and listing, please?
PAUL	Hastings, Michigan. I'm looking for Donna Mitchell.
MALE 411 OPERATOR	I have two Donna Mitchells, sir. One on Federal Road and one on Ardmore Avenue.
PAUL	Ardmore Avenue...I think. Yeah. Shit, I don't know. Just give me that one.
MALE 411 OPERATOR	Ardmore Avenue?
PAUL	Yes, Ardmore Avenue.
MALE 411 OPERATOR	Please hold for your number. Paul is switched to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE.
AUTOMATED MESSAGE	The number you requested, 269-948- 1998 can automatically be dialed for a charge of twenty-five cents by pressing the number one. Paul writes Donna's number and name on the top of the coffin
PAUL	Come on! Where the hell is everyone? DONNA eventually answers.
DONNA	Hello? Hearing her voice, Paul hurriedly places the phone to his
PAUL	Donna, it's Paul.
DONNA	Hey, how's it going?
PAUL	Where's Linda? She's not answering her phone. I need to talk to her, I've been taken hostage by... Donna interrupts. We realize, as does Paul, that her voice Fooled you. I'm not really home. But if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I get in. Bye-bye. His hand falls to his forehead, defeated.
PAUL	Donna, I need to talk to Linda. It's an absolute emergency. Have her call me. Use star sixty-nine and find out the number I'm calling from and have her call me... Donna picks up the phone.
DONNA	Paul?
PAUL	Donna.
DONNA	What do you want?
PAUL	I need to talk to Linda. Where is she?
DONNA	I don't know. I haven't talked to her all day. Call her cell phone.
PAUL	Are you near a computer or something?
DONNA	Uh...yeah. Why?
PAUL	Turn it on. It is on.
PAUL	Look up the number for the State Department for me.
DONNA	I was just heading out to the supermarket. I really don't have
PAUL	Donna, please, please, please -- just get me the number.
DONNA	Is everything alright?
PAUL	No! Everything is not alright! So, please, just look up the number.
DONNA	Don't fucking yell at me, Paul.
PAUL	I'm not yelling!
DONNA	Yes you are. Just like you did last year at the cookout. I'm not going to tolerate -- Just get me the fucking number!! Get me the number, get me the number!! Donna hangs up on him. Realizing this, Paul bangs his fists He violently tosses and turns and screams at the top of his He eventually calms quite a bit. Sniffing away tears and He lies there, motionless. The silence is almost comforting. Paul closes his eyes, After a beat, he calls Donna back. Knowing it is Paul
DONNA	What? It takes every ounce of Paul's being to keep himself from
PAUL	Donna, I'm very sorry I yelled. But, I'm only going to ask you once more to get me this number. If you don't get me this number, I'm going to die.
DONNA	What?
PAUL	I don't have time to explain. Please...the number. Hold on. We hear Donna put down the phone. In the b.g., we hear the Okay...State Department. It's 202-
DONNA	Yeah. Paul writes the number on the top of the coffin, beneath the What the hell's going -- Paul hangs up on Donna mid-sentence. He dials the number the A STATE DEPARTMENT REP answers after a few rings.
STATE DEPARTMENT REP	United States Department of State.
PAUL	I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq. I've been taken hostage. I need to speak to someone right away.
STATE DEPARTMENT REP	Where are you calling from, sir?
PAUL	From Iraq. I'm a truck driver for CRT -- Crestin, Roland and Thomas. We were attacked and now I'm being held for ransom.
STATE DEPARTMENT REP	Are the kidnappers with you?
PAUL	No. I'm buried somewhere.
STATE DEPARTMENT REP	You're buried?
PAUL	Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box. It's an old coffin, I think.
STATE DEPARTMENT REP	Did you try contacting the military out there?
PAUL	I don't have the number.
STATE DEPARTMENT REP	What number?
PAUL	I was given a number to call, a safety number. But the people took it.
STATE DEPARTMENT REP	The people holding you hostage?
PAUL	Yes. I don't know...hold on. Let me connect you...hold on.
PAUL	No. Wait... Paul is placed on hold. As he waits, his eyes wander around
REBECCA	Rebecca Browning.
PAUL	Hello?
REBECCA	Yes, hello. I was just informed of your situation.
PAUL	Yeah, my situation. I'm running out of time and you people keep putting me on hold. What the hell is wrong with you?
REBECCA	I'm sorry.
PAUL	Don't be sorry. Just help me.
REBECCA	I just have a few questions for you, Mister Conroy.
PAUL	You've got to be kidding me.
REBECCA	It's important that I get this information. It will make a rescue
PAUL	Wait, wait, wait...how did you know my name?
REBECCA	I'm sorry?
PAUL	I never gave you my name. I don't think I gave it to the other guy, either. Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone.
PAUL (CONT'D)	What the hell is going on right now?
REBECCA	We received a call from a representative at CRT. You left him a message?
PAUL	Yeah...?
REBECCA	He contacted us right away.
PAUL	Well, since you know what the hell is going on, what have you done to get me out of here?
REBECCA	There's little we can do from Washington.
PAUL	So, that's it? I'm just supposed to rot in here because there's little you can do?
REBECCA	No.
PAUL	Then what?
REBECCA	I need to know where you were when your convoy was ambushed.
PAUL	In the Diyala Provence. In Baqubah.
REBECCA	Okay. And has contact been made with the kidnappers?
PAUL	Yes. The guy told me that he wants five million dollars by nine o'clock tonight.
REBECCA	Or else...?
PAUL	Or else he'll bring me to Sea World. What do you think, lady? Even faced with Paul's sarcasm, Rebecca remains stolid.
REBECCA	We'll do everything we can.
PAUL	So you'll pay them? No. That we can't do.
PAUL	Wait...what?
REBECCA	It's the policy of the United States government to not negotiate with terrorists.
PAUL	To hell with that! It's easy for you to worry about policy, you're sitting in an air conditioned office somewhere, probably finishing up your sandwich from lunch. You're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the God damn desert!
REBECCA	I understand your frustration --
PAUL	Frustration? Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here. Understand that! Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone. Paul Hello? Worried, Paul lights the Zippo. The reflection of the flame
REBECCA	I'm here. Momentary relief. After a beat:
PAUL	Well, then say something. Tell me how you're going to get me out of here.
REBECCA	What's the number on the phone you're calling from?
PAUL	I don't know. Did it come up on your end?
REBECCA	No. It's listed as unavailable. Do this -- take down this number.
PAUL	Go ahead. Paul writes the number onto the top of the coffin.
PAUL	Who's that?
REBECCA	Dan Brenner. He's the commander of the Hostage Working Group over in Iraq.
PAUL	Hostage Working Group?
REBECCA	We formed it in 2004 to deal with situations such as yours. Paul shakes his head in disgust.
PAUL	Situations. I love how you keep calling it that.
REBECCA	Did you write down the number?
PAUL	Yeah.
REBECCA	Good. Hold on, I'll connect you with him now. He should be expecting you.
PAUL	What about the news? I'm going to call them.
REBECCA	No. Do not, I repeat, do not contact the news.
PAUL	Why?
REBECCA	It will only complicate things further and threaten your chances of rescue. Paul doesn't buy it.
PAUL	That's bullshit. You're just covering your ass.
REBECCA	No, I'm covering yours. Everyone who needs to know about this does.
PAUL	You don't go looking for something if you don't know it's missing.
REBECCA	That's why you need to contact Dan Brenner right away. Paul still contemplates contacting the news, but soon
PAUL	Fine.
REBECCA	I'm transferring you now. Paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him, outside the With the Zippo still lit, Paul takes a deep, centering A few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard. After two
DAN	Brenner.
PAUL	Dan Brenner? Dan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling
DAN	Is this Paul Conroy? Yes, yes it's me. It's Paul.
DAN	Paul, I was informed of what's going on. I want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there.
PAUL	Oh, thank you, God.
DAN	I was told that we have until 9pm. Is that right?
PAUL	That's what he said.
DAN	Alright. That doesn't give us a whole lot of time. And just so I have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground?
PAUL	Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.
DAN	Okay. My guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal, you're no more than a few feet underground.
PAUL	I don't know. Maybe.
DAN	What about battery life? How much does the phone have left? Paul looks at the display to find out.
PAUL	Less than half.
DAN	Okay. You have to conserve that battery. Our best bet of finding you is by tracking your cell signal. Is the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?
PAUL	Vibrate.
DAN	Press and hold down the asterisk key to change it to a ring tone. It will use less power.
PAUL	What about my Zippo?
DAN	You have a lighter?
PAUL	Yeah.
DAN	Use it to look around for markings, a logo -- whatever you can find.
PAUL	Won't it use up oxygen?
DAN	Not much. Don't worry about that now. Try to find --
PAUL	It's really dark in here without it.
DAN	I understand, Paul. Try to find anything in there that might indicate where that coffin was made.
PAUL	You guys have to hurry.
DAN	We're working as fast as we can, Paul.
PAUL	Do you know if there were any other survivors?
DAN	From your convoy?
PAUL	Yeah.
DAN	That's still unclear at this point.
PAUL	I just wanted to do right by my family. That's all. I didn't know it was going to be like this over here.
DAN	I don't think any of us did. While on the phone with Brenner, Paul gets another call
PAUL	It's him. He's calling.
DAN	The kidnapper? Yeah. What do I do?
DAN	You know his number?
PAUL	Yeah.
DAN	Give it to me.
PAUL	What about the call?
DAN	Give me the number first. The phone has rung several times. Paul fears that Jabir may
PAUL	He's going to hang up.
DAN	Take the call.
DAN	Take the call. Now. Paul complies with Dan's demand and switches to the other
PAUL	Hello.
JABIR	Two hour, six minute. Paul looks at his watch. Indeed, he has but two hours and
PAUL	You have to give me more time.
JABIR	You talk to embassy? They give money?
PAUL	Yes. No. I talked to...someone. Government. They said that they won't pay the money.
JABIR	No pay?
PAUL	No. They said that they don't negotiate with terrorists.
JABIR	Terrorists? I am terrorist?
PAUL	Yes. You are terrorist, you son of a bitch.
JABIR	You are terrified, so I am terrorist?
PAUL	What did I ever do to you?
JABIR	Ever do?
PAUL	Yeah. I'm here because it's a job, to make money. That's it.
JABIR	I have job until you come. Now, my family have nothing.
PAUL	That's not my fault! Jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to Paul's.
JABIR	Nine, one, one was not my fault, but still you are here! Saddam was not my fault, but still you are here!
PAUL	I told you, I'm only here to work. To help rebuild.
JABIR	Rebuild what you destroyed.
PAUL	Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay? I'm nobody that makes decisions about anything. I just want to go home. Silence from the other end of the phone for an extended
JABIR	You make video, ransom video. This surprisingly comes as good news to Paul.
PAUL	Yes. Please. Get me out of here and I'll make the video.
JABIR	No. You make video now.
PAUL	What...? How?
JABIR	You use video on phone. Paul's hopes are dashed. His sanguine head falls back onto Near foot. You read note near foot in box. Paul shines the flame of his Zippo lighter toward his feet.
PAUL	Where? I don't see --
JABIR	Near foot. Read note inside box. Paul repositions his legs as best he can. He can vaguely see
PAUL	The video...if I make it, will you let me go?
JABIR	Only if we get money.
PAUL	Nobody's going to pay five million dollars for me.
JABIR	We take less. One million money.
PAUL	If they pay it, will you let me go?
JABIR	One million money. Jabir hangs up, ending the call. Paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that Jabir He again looks down toward his feet. He can see the Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick, Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. He Per usual, he gets the answering machine. His son, Shane, is
SHANE	Thanks for calling the Conroy's. We're not home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks. Paul's eyes well up with tears. He smiles at the sound of He looks at the time. It's 7:02pm. Battery life is holding
PAUL	Shit. Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone Paul dials Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Dan answers.
DAN	Paul?
PAUL	Here's his number...
DAN	Hold on. Alright, go ahead.
PAUL	It's 07902-24-921. Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him,
DAN	This is huge. Unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes.
PAUL	What about me? Can you track my cell signal?
DAN	We're having a lot of trouble with yours. Seems to be an EDS line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers.
PAUL	What does that mean?
DAN	That...it's not going to be easy.
PAUL	He wants me to make a ransom video.
DAN	No. Hold off for as long as you can.
PAUL	If it's going to get me out of here, I'm making it.
DAN	The last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera.
PAUL	We? Paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is being
DAN	This can't turn into an international incident.
PAUL	That's all you people care about! But what about me? Don't you care about me?
DAN	We do. That's why we're --
PAUL	No you don't! You people don't care about any of us. I've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today. We don't have any guns, any armor. Nothing.
DAN	You're not soldiers.
PAUL	Tell that to the people who put me in this box! Tell that to the people who shot my friends!
DAN	We're doing the best we can.
PAUL	No, you're not. All you people understand are your secret plans and your back room politics.
PAUL (CONT'D)	If I were some diplomat or something, maybe even a hostage working group leader -- or whatever your fancy title is, I'd be out of here by now. Wouldn't I? But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to keep my mouth shut and die.
DAN	I need you to stay focused, Paul.
PAUL	Fuck you. Dan's heard enough.
DAN	Paul, listen to me: finding you is our primary concern. Bottom line. And we're searching just as hard as we would be for a four-star general, so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise. Paul does not respond at first. Dan's retort clearly has an
PAUL	Who are they? The people who put me here?
DAN	They're just that -- people. No different from you and me.
PAUL	I'm no terrorist.
DAN	Neither are they.
PAUL	How do you know that?
DAN	If you were homeless, starving...actually, I take that back. If your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them?
PAUL	I wouldn't kill someone.
DAN	How can you be sure? What difference does it make?
DAN	They're criminals, desperate ones at that. They don't care about anything other than getting the money.
PAUL	So pay them, then.
DAN	Trust me, if it was an option, I would do that in a heartbeat.
PAUL	How many others have there been?
DAN	Since I got here? Hundreds. Journalists, contractors, soldiers...hundreds have been taken. It's one of the only functioning businesses out here.
PAUL	How many have you rescued? Dan is reluctant to answer the question.
PAUL (CONT'D)	How many? Not many.
PAUL	Tell me their names.
DAN	Who?
PAUL	Any of them. Make me know they really do matter to you.
DAN	Mark White.
PAUL	Who was Mark White?
DAN	A kid from New Hampshire. Twenty- six years old. Med student. Came over here to help out local doctors.
PAUL	What happened to him?
DAN	Insurgents grabbed him.
PAUL	When?
DAN	About three weeks ago. Paul writes "MARK WHITE" on the top of the coffin, below the
PAUL	You remember his name.
DAN	I remember all their names.
PAUL	Did he...? Is he...? The glow stick begins to fade.
DAN	Yeah. Yeah, Paul, he's alive. Hearing this affords Paul some semblance of relief.
PAUL	Where is he?
DAN	Home. Probably happy to be back at school.
PAUL	I want to get out of here. We found him; we'll find you, too.
PAUL	How?
DAN	We already have a solid lead on the number you gave us.
PAUL	You do?
DAN	A unit's on it's way over there now.
PAUL	That's...that's good.
DAN	Yeah.
PAUL	What should I do in the meantime?
DAN	I know it's hard, but try to relax. The more worked up you are, the more air you're going to use.
PAUL	I can't help it. I'm always anxious. I take pills for it.
DAN	Do you have them with you? Paul checks his pants pockets. He removes a small, orange
PAUL	Yeah.
DAN	Take them. You need to preserve your oxygen level any way you can.
PAUL	Okay.
DAN	Is your Zippo still lit.
PAUL	Not now.
DAN	Good.
PAUL	I feel nauseous.
DAN	You have to calm down.
PAUL	I'm trying.
DAN	And you need to save that battery. We're expecting some intel in about ten minutes. Call me back then.
PAUL	Okay.
DAN	Just hang in there, Paul. The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul shakes it,
PAUL	Yeah. I'm trying. Dan ends the call. Paul lets out a deep breath, finding it Just then, the cell phone rings. Checking the number on the Paul answers.
PAUL	What?
JABIR	Did you make video?
PAUL	No. Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we Collectively, they do not sound pleased. Slightly panicked, You make video!
PAUL	Let me out and I'll make it.
JABIR	No! You make video now. In box.
PAUL	I can't. I can't read the paper.
JABIR	Make video now!
PAUL	I can't. I don't know what you want me to say. I can't read the paper. Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the Jabir returns his attention back to Paul.
JABIR	You make video now. Jabir ends the call. Paul closes the phone to help conserve He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and
PAUL	I'm never getting out of here. Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the In efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. He drops He sits and waits. Nothing is happening, except that his After a moment, Paul picks up the cell phone. He holds it in After a few rings, a NURSING HOME NURSE answers.
NURSING HOME NURSE	Mountain View Nursing Home.
PAUL	I was hoping I could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please.
NURSING HOME NURSE	Um...okay. Ah...let me bring the cordless phone to her room. Hold on a moment, please. We hear the Nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor. She Misses Conroy, you have a telephone call, dear. Here, you can use this phone. Paul's mother, MARYANNE, answers. Her voice is pleasant but
MARYANNE	Hello?
PAUL	Mom...it's Paul.
MARYANNE	Who?
PAUL	It's Paul, Mom. Your son.
MARYANNE	My son?
PAUL	It's okay, Mom. How are you?
MARYANNE	I'm fine.
PAUL	That's good.
MARYANNE	Who are you?
PAUL	It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie.
MARYANNE	Paulie?
PAUL	Yeah. Remember? We lived over on Colfax Street, in the duplex. Remember? Paulie?
PAUL	That's right, Mom.
MARYANNE	Is this Paulie?
PAUL	It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's everything at the home?
MARYANNE	Very nice. Your father and I have been playing gin rummy every night. It's almost too much for Paul to take. He cries silent tears
PAUL	Yeah...I don't think Pop's there with you, Mom.
MARYANNE	How are you doing, sweetie?
PAUL	Not very good. This...uh, this may be the last time I talk to you.
MARYANNE	That's nice, honey.
PAUL	Did you get the flowers I sent a few months ago?
MARYANNE	Flowers?
PAUL	Yeah, I sent...never mind. Listen, I...I'm going to go now. I just wanted to talk to you, you know, just to say bye. I love you, Mom. Maryanne doesn't respond. Did you hear me? Mom? I told you...do you want to tell me you
MARYANNE	Yes, dear. Your father and I have been playing gin rummy every night.
PAUL	Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi. Paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart out. After a long beat, the cell phone rings. Decidedly different He eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the incoming Several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image
PAUL	Oh no. No, no, no! Paul frantically dials the number to reach Jabir. As soon as
JABIR	Video make?
PAUL	Let her go. Please. Please don't hurt her. The Woman is heard in the background of Jabir's phone, crying
JABIR	We shoot her if you no make video.
PAUL	No! No, please no shoot. No shoot her.
JABIR	You get money. American million.
PAUL	I will, I promise. Just don't shoot her. She's a mother, she's got two kids.
JABIR	Two kids?
PAUL	Yes. She has two kids.
JABIR	I have five. Now only one. You make video. Now!!
PAUL	Wait...
JABIR	No wait!! I give three seconds.
PAUL	I can't read the paper.
JABIR	Three...
PAUL	No. Wait!
JABIR	Two...
PAUL	I don't know what you want me to say!
JABIR	One.
PAUL	Okay! Okay, I'll make the video. Just, please, don't shoot. Jabir does not fire his gun. Paul attempts to catch his I need to hang up to make the video. Okay? Is that okay?
JABIR	You have three minute to send video. Jabir hangs up, ending the call. Paul reaches for the balled-up piece of paper that has the Placing the flashlight next to the paper, Paul is again
PAUL	Fuck... He drops the paper to his side and opens the phone, setting
PAUL	My name is Paul Conroy. I'm an American citizen from Hastings, Michigan. I'm a civilian truck driver for Crestin, Roland and Thomas. I've been taken hostage somewhere in Iraq...and I need one million dollars by nine o'clock tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll be left to die in this coffin I'm buried in. I've been told that if... The flashlight goes out. Paul continues speaking in the ...the money is paid, I will be let go. If it's not, I will die in here. These threats are real and will be followed through on. Trying to think of more to say, Paul soon opts for not saying We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video Paul places the phone on his chest. Still rubbing his He opens the phone and displays the photo of the Woman. He The effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect, his His eyes slowly shift downward, as if watching something move A shape moves across his stomach, underneath his T-shirt. Paul leans the glow stick in further. And further. He leans in even closer with the glow stick. But then -- The snake turns its muscled neck to face Paul. Their eyes The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself Another flash-fire, this time burning the snake. It hisses The fire soon extinguishes. The snake burrows into the hole Paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button-down Suddenly, the cell phone vibrates. Paul frenziedly searches We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plastic Worst still, and completely unbeknownst to Paul, a stream of
PAUL	No, no, no!! Desperately straining every muscle in his body, he extends The phone stops ringing. He has missed the call. With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, Paul With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul -- but Paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to A sign of hope, as well as a point of reference for his He listens further as the call to prayer continues. The Paul then opens his phone. Sees that he missed Jabir's call.
PAUL	There you are. We see, on the display of the phone, that Paul has found a
LINDA (V.O.)	Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message. Thanks and have a great day. The beep sounds, and Paul frantically proceeds right into his
PAUL	Linda, here's the number for the phone. I just found it out. It's 07902-42-884. You have to use the international calling code first.
PAUL (CONT'D)	Please call me as soon as you get this. I love you...I love you. Call me right away. Please. Paul hangs up. He looks at the battery life left on the Oh shit. He begins to panic. Grabbing the pocket knife that was left
PAUL	Son of a... Paul grabs the flashlight. Turns it on. It works for a He turns the top, switching to the red bulb. It works. The He returns his attention to the coffin. His efforts to use The flashlight turns off. After a good shaking, it turns With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind As he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings. Paul's trepidation is evident. He fears what the incoming She sits on her knees. Standing behind her are three men, Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through
WOMAN	My name is Pamela Gorham. I'm a food service worker at F.O.B. Anaconda, employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas. My captors' requests for ransom have gone unanswered, and -- The Woman, Pamela, looks off-screen to her right. Someone is
WOMAN (CONT'D)	No...wait!! Please -- no!! Another Iraqi man steps into the camera's line of site, a Without as much as a moment's hesitation, he fires two rounds He screams aloud, slamming his closed fist against the bottom
PAUL	No! No, no, no!!! Still in the throes of emotional torment, Paul vomits on The hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the Paul closes his eyes. A small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his He can't do it. The flashlight falls from Paul's chest. It turns off upon Paul sits in darkness. His breaths echo off the coffin After a beat, he turns on the flashlight. It turns off after A moment later, we hear a click, followed by the sight of a
DAN	Why the hell did you make that video?
PAUL	It's all a bunch of lies.
DAN	What is? What are you talking about?
PAUL	All of it.
DAN	All of what?
PAUL	Nobody gives a shit about any of us. We're nothing to you people.
DAN	We're going to find you.
PAUL	By looking the other way?
DAN	You can't start breaking on me now, Paul. You have to stay strong.
PAUL	You let her die.
DAN	No I didn't.
PAUL	They shot her...and you didn't do anything.
DAN	We didn't even know she had been taken hostage.
PAUL	She sent three videos.
DAN	That's what they told her to say.
PAUL	Why?
DAN	I don't know.
PAUL	What do you know? That your ransom video already has 47,000 hits on YouTube. And all the major networks are playing it, including Al Jazeera. So, now your captors have no choice but to follow through.
PAUL	I found out the number to this phone.
DAN	How?
PAUL	I found a way to change the display language. I figured that out, and you didn't. Why?
DAN	Because I didn't. Just like you and every other person on this planet, there are some things I know and some things I don't.
PAUL	Then how are you ever going to find me?
DAN	Their signal was cloned, like we figured. But, we're close. Real close.
PAUL	What about mine?
DAN	We're working on that, too.
PAUL	I'm near a Mosque. I could hear the call to prayer over the P.A.
DAN	Good. That means that we're in the right area.
PAUL	You're nearby?
DAN	I spoke with soldiers from the third ID who were escorting your convoy.
PAUL	They're alive? After a beat:
DAN	Not all of them. Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs. The rest got caught in small arms fire. What the hell happened out there, Paul?
DAN (CONT'D)	Paul. After a beat:
PAUL	We had just left Anaconda, everything seemed okay. We knew that a bunch of our CB radios had been stolen and that the Iraqis were listening in, so we made sure to switch from our usual channels. Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the convoy commander. She wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from base, but it seemed safer for her to be with the C.C. As we headed down the road, all these kids came running into the street. Dozens of them. It almost seemed like they were expecting us, except we got there faster than they thought we would. So they run on up in front of me, and I slam on my brakes. The rest of the drivers were already further up ahead, so they kept going. Next thing I know, one of the lead trucks got hit by an IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the radio saying, Sandman's hit, Sandman's hit. He's...he's everywhere.
PAUL (CONT'D)	That's when the Iraqis came out of their mud huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody. I couldn't believe what was happening. It seemed like slow- motion, like I was watching it on TV. People -- my friends -- were getting killed, and all I could do is watch. I didn't even notice that the kids were throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield. Sort of snapped me out of my trance. But then, I guess I got hit in the head with a rock, `cause I blacked out.
DAN	Do you happen to remem...mo... nea... The cell phone service begins to cut out. Suddenly, the Within seconds, the explosions grow louder and more Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand Oh no...no... Paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting. White
PAUL	This can't be happening. We see that Dan Brenner is no longer on the phone, and that Once he feels it is secure enough, Paul slowly moves his body
PAUL (CONT'D)	No. Come on. Please work. He shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin, Then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings. Paul answers Hello? Hello? Who's there? Alan Davenport answers calmly from the other end.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Is this Paul Conroy?
PAUL	Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are you?
ALAN DAVENPORT	Paul, my name's Alan Davenport, I'm the personnel director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
PAUL	I left you a message.
ALAN DAVENPORT	You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning over at the State Department. Are you able to speak on the status of your situation?
PAUL	It's worse. There was an explosion or something. The coffin's breaking, there's sand pouring in from everywhere. I only have a half an hour before --
ALAN DAVENPORT	Okay, okay. Slow down. You should try to stay calm. Tell me something, Paul, who have you spoken to?
PAUL	The hostage takers, Dan Brenner from the hostage working group --
ALAN DAVENPORT	Okay, Paul. I'm with you. How about the media. I know your ransom video leaked, but have you spoken directly to anyone about what's going on? The flashlight goes out. Paul hits it a few times and it
PAUL	No. That's good. It needs to stay that way. It's important that we keep this situation as contained as possible. Paul finds Alan's obvious concern with doing damage control
PAUL	About three inches to my right, there's a wall. Three inches to my left, there's another wall. And about four inches above my head, there's a roof that's about to collapse and drown me in sand. I think this situation is pretty contained.
ALAN DAVENPORT	I know you're upset --
PAUL	Help me! Help me! What are you going to do to help me?!
ALAN DAVENPORT	I know you're upset. And, from what I've been told, steps are being taken to get you out of there. So, hopefully it won't be much longer.
PAUL	Thank God.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Yes, thank God. I'm going to switch on a recorder right now. Just a second... Paul's visage expresses his confusion. A click is heard in the b.g. of Alan's phone, followed by a Alan's speech becomes very laconic. His questions are This is Alan Davenport, Personnel Director for Crestin, Roland and Thomas, Incorporated. The date is October 23, 2006. I am speaking with Paul Conroy. Mister Conroy, are you aware that I'm recording this conversation?
PAUL	What...?
ALAN DAVENPORT	Please answer the question. The flashlight goes out again.
PAUL	Shit. Paul hits it, but it does not catch. He sits in darkness.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Mister Conroy?
PAUL	Yes. Yes!
ALAN DAVENPORT	And do I have your permission to do so?
PAUL	Why do you need my permission? What is all this? I need you to answer yes or no, please.
PAUL	Yes. Alright? Yes! Paul hits the flashlight. It turns back on.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy, when were you hired by CRT?
PAUL	About nine months ago. Around January of 2005. Why are you wasting time with this?
ALAN DAVENPORT	I have your official date of hire as January 4th, 2005. Is that correct?
PAUL	Who cares? This is fucking crazy --
ALAN DAVENPORT	January 4th, 2005. Is that correct?
PAUL	Yes!
ALAN DAVENPORT	And during your initial training, before being sent to Iraq, were you made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired.
PAUL	You mean when I came down there to Dallas and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass? The flashlight dims. Paul angrily shakes it, returning it to
PAUL (CONT'D)	You mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here? Is that when I was made aware? I need you to answer yes or no, please. Yes. The flashlight begins to slowly dim.
ALAN DAVENPORT	During that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with CRT, which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment?
PAUL	Yeah, I signed a bunch of things.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Yes or no.
PAUL	Yes. I signed the contract. Yes!
ALAN DAVENPORT	It's our understanding that you were taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago, is that also correct?
PAUL	Yes. That's completely correct. What is the point of all this?
ALAN DAVENPORT	Our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company. As of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated.
PAUL	Wait, wait, wait -- The flashlight dims even more.
ALAN DAVENPORT	It was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow CRT employee -- Pamela Gorham.
PAUL	No. Wait --
ALAN DAVENPORT	Stipulated in your contract was a fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly that any relationship, be it romantic or sexual in nature, deemed inappropriate by CRT senior officials is grounds for immediate termination.
PAUL	We...we were just friends.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Our records indicate differently.
PAUL	This is bullshit.
ALAN DAVENPORT	We're also legally required to inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ of CRT at the time of your abduction, we cannot be held accountable for any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of termination. Therefore, in your case, that includes this incident or any consequences that may result from it. Paul sees where Alan is going with this. He's thunderstruck.
PAUL	What about my insurance money? My family will need that money...
ALAN DAVENPORT	Given that you were alive up until the time of your termination --
PAUL	You son of a bitch. You can't do this.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Do you understand everything --
PAUL	You can't do this! Alan takes a second before trying again.
ALAN DAVENPORT	Do you understand everything you've been told, Mister Conroy? Paul does not answer.
ALAN DAVENPORT (CONT'D)	Mister Conroy? After a long beat:
PAUL	Go to hell.
ALAN DAVENPORT	That concludes our interview with Paul Conroy. I am now turning off the recorder. A click is heard. The humming ceases.
PAUL	You people can't just wash your hands of this. You bastards put me here.
ALAN DAVENPORT	I'm sorry. Alan ends the call. Paul looks at the phone -- it is still holding a steady He shakes his hand free of the pile of sand that now covers The flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely. Only
PAUL	Come on...
PAUL	Answer the phone!! Paul tries Jabir once again, but still he does not answer the
PAUL	Why won't you answer?!! It's then that something occurs to Paul. He stares at the The crack has split Jabir's written phone number in half. The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of Paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full well Paul is surprisingly serene.
DAN	Paul, is that you?
PAUL	They're dead.
DAN	How do you know that?
PAUL	I just do.
DAN	Three F-16s levelled parts of the city a few minutes ago.
PAUL	I know. I felt it. Did they know I was here? The Zippo flame flutters. Weakens.
DAN	Yeah.
PAUL	Did they care? Dan does not answer. These people that took me -- if they're dead, they can't tell you where I am.
DAN	We can still try to track down your signal.
PAUL	You tried that already.
DAN	We can try again. Paul appreciates Dan's effort, but he knows there is little
PAUL (CONT'D)	It's over, isn't it? After a long beat:
DAN	No. Paul doesn't say a word. He knows that Dan is lying. After
DAN (CONT'D)	Yeah.
PAUL	What should I do?
DAN	I don't know.
PAUL	That's right -- just like everyone else on the planet, there are some things you know and some things you don't.
DAN	I wish this could have gone differently.
PAUL	Yeah...me too. After a long beat, Paul ends the call. He forces a smile to Utterly hopeless, he opens the phone and turns on the video He presses Record.
PAUL (CONT'D)	This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social Security number 048-32-1198, date of birth 3/19/68. This video will serve as my last will and testament. To my wife, Linda Conroy, I leave the seven hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever I have left in my annuity. To my son, Shane Conroy, I...I don't know. I don't have anything else. My stuff, like, my clothes. I wish I had more...I wish I had done more. Your dad wasn't really much of anything, Shane, I'm sorry. Maybe if I was a famous baseball player, or a guy who wore a suit to work, I would have more to leave you. But, you can be one of those people if you want. You can be whatever you want. Just promise me that when you get older, you'll take good care of your mom. And promise me that you'll always try to do the right thing, no matter what. I love you very much, Shane. Maybe I never said that enough...maybe I did, I don't even know. That probably means I didn't. I'm sorry, Linda. I should have listened to you. Paul ends the video and closes the phone. He carefully The Zippo flame goes out. Paul sits in the darkness, Hold on black for several seconds...until --
PAUL	You're not dead. Jabir is heard speaking frantically in Arabic to the several
PAUL (CONT'D)	Hello? Hello?! Jabir turns his attention to Paul.
JABIR	Where is money?
PAUL	I don't know.
JABIR	What don't know?
PAUL	I don't know where the money is.
JABIR	Liar!
PAUL	I'm not lying! I swear.
JABIR	Swear?
PAUL	I'm telling the truth.
JABIR	From Embassy, you get money now!
PAUL	I can't!
JABIR	You will!!
PAUL	I need more time. Please. Paul shakes and hits the flashlight. It still does not work.
JABIR	No more time!
PAUL	There's sand pouring in here. I can't...it's everywhere. Please, let me out of here and I will get you the money. Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next to Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight. Switches the Nothing. Jabir returns to the phone.
JABIR (CONT'D)	You show blood.
PAUL	What? Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again. Removes the
JABIR	You show blood, they give money.
PAUL	No.
JABIR	You cut off thumb finger, send video.
PAUL	I'm not doing that.
JABIR	Yes! Paul puts the batteries back inside the flashlight. Begins
PAUL	No.
JABIR	No?
PAUL	That's right, no. You let me out of here, and I'll cut off my whole God damn hand if you want. Jabir again says something to someone in the room with him,
JABIR	You have wife? Click. The flashlight turns on!
PAUL	Yes, I do. And a son. A young son. I want to go home...to see them. Please, sir.
JABIR	Sir?
PAUL	Yes. Sir. I say that out of respect...to you.
JABIR	243 East Walnut Street. Hastings, Michigan. U.S.A. That's my...why did you say that?
JABIR	You show blood...or they show blood.
PAUL	That's...you're lying. You're nobody...all of you. You can't get to them.
JABIR	No?
PAUL	No. You're peasants, criminals, that's all. You don't even know where Michigan is.
JABIR	Detroit. Ann Arbor. Even this basic knowledge is enough to make Jabir's threats
PAUL	You looked at a map. That's all you did.
JABIR	You show blood, or they show blood. Send video by five minutes. Jabir ends the call. Realizing that Jabir is gone, Paul
LINDA (V.O.)	Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message. Thanks and have a great day. Linda, listen to me: you and Shane have to go somewhere... anywhere.
PAUL (CONT'D)	Don't stay at the house, whatever you do, do not stay at the house. The guy...the kidnapper, he knows our address. He stole my license and now he knows where we live. Go to the Sheriff's station if you have to, just don't go home. Paul hangs up. He takes a moment to look around, noticing
PAUL (CONT'D)	Holy God. Paul then dials Dan Brenner. After only one ring, the call
DAN	This is Daniel Brenner. Please leave a message at the tone. The beep sounds. Paul delivers a frenzied message.
PAUL	Brenner, where are you?! He's alive! He just called me! Call me right away! The fucking guy is still alive! Paul hangs up the phone. Unsure what to do next, Paul's heartbeat races. He fidgets, They can't find them. They...can't. There's no way. Paul opens the phone and brings up the photo of Pamela, bound Paul tries the Zippo. Nothing. Only sparks. He tosses it His breathing grows erratic and labored. His eyes dart from
PAUL (CONT'D)	Oh my God. Oh my God. He places his hands against the side of the coffin, spreading
PAUL(CONT'D)	Holy shit. Paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired His heart races, his breaths are the deepest he's ever taken. Grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a We see, through the display screen of the phone, Paul sever He falls to his side, still screaming and writhing. He Paul wraps the shirt around his hand. The blood quickly soaks He is fading fast. His blood loss is great. Shock sets in. While laying against the side of the coffin, the phone He then hears what sounds like VOICES, yelling from on top of
VOICE #1	He's down here!
VOICE #2	Get him out! Keep digging!
VOICE #3	Paul, we're here! The cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in Paul's The top of the coffin is torn open, sending a brilliant ray He's still alone. He's still in the coffin, which continues The phone continues to vibrate. It soon stops. Paul is in After a beat, the phone begins vibrating once again. After
PAUL	Yeah?
DAN	Paul, it's Brenner. Paul doesn't have the strength to answer.
DAN (CONT'D)	Paul? Are you there? Paul?
PAUL	I'm...here.
DAN	We're coming for you now. You hear me? We know where you are.
PAUL	You're coming?
DAN	We are, Paul. We're almost there now.
PAUL	How do you know?
DAN	Coalition forces picked up a Shiite insurgent just outside of Baghdad.
DAN (CONT'D)	Said he knew where an American was buried alive. He agreed to show us where if we let him go.
PAUL	You're coming for me?
DAN	We're practically there already. An impossible smile fights its way to Paul's lips. His
PAUL	You have to hurry.
DAN	We are.
PAUL	No...you have to hurry. The sand...it's filling up fast.
DAN	Just hang in there for three more minutes. This will all be over soon, I promise. Paul is very hopeful that Dan is correct in his assumption.
PAUL	Okay. I believe you. Thank you. Thank you. A beep is heard. Paul has another call coming in. He's
DAN	Three minutes. Try to --
PAUL	I have to go!
