ROBIN	Why must you walk in back of me?
ASLAN	In your land am I not the infidel? The unbeliever, the instrument of evil? ROBIN Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point. ASLAN Then I trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal. ROBIN For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family. ASLAN Those are my burdens.
ROBIN	You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed? Saracen maintains a moody silence.
ROBIN	So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman? Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly. ROBIN By the Lord, that's it! is silent, but Robin knows he's right.

GISBORNE	You're not playing by the rules, boy. Deer don't climb trees... Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird. Shall we teach him to fly? Cut it down! soldiers hack at the trunk. The tree quivers.
ROBIN	Hold!... I am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it. in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches GISBORNE Stand back, stranger. This is no affair of yours.
ROBIN	Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal. GISBORNE I advise you to move on, pilgrim. This is the Sheriff's land. ROBIN Wrong. This is my land, and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me. GISBORNE I grow dangerously tired of your wit... Chop it down! ROBIN The man who strikes that tree dies. glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his

ASLAN	The conquering hero returns.
ROBIN	Ha! It was you he was scared of. humor is infectious. Robin's anger relents.

ASLAN	Easy... Look at him. steps into the moonlight. His face crudely-
ROBIN	What has happened? DUNCAN They say they captured him worshipping with the Druids. He signed a confession before the Bishop of Hereford. ROBIN Did they have witnesses? DUNCAN Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall. The Bishop decreed all the Locksley lands forfeit.
ROBIN	Did you believe the charges?
DUNCAN	Not even when they took my eyes. ROBIN Who did this to you, Duncan?

ROBIN	I failed him. I should have been here at his side.
DUNCAN	You must leave, head north to safety. Gisborne will surely seek revenge. ROBIN Leave me.
