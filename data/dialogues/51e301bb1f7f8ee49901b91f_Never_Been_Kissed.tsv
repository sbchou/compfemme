CHARACTER	DIALOGUE
	is so not a dream. stadium clock sets at 5:00. The crowd goes crazy. Josie takes a deep, nervous breath and smiles, "Oh God." images of Josie play across rows of TV sets. A crowd has gathered.
	wasn't supposed to be like this. I was just trying to do my job. And then things happened. Well, life happened. And now I'm here. clock starts to tick down. The crowd yells again. me. I am not the kind of girl who does things like this. I mean, two months ago you couldn't have picked me out of a crowd... with office workers. Bustling with activity. The camera searches the crowd. you. I'm over there. camera swings to Josie entering. Rhoda, a young copy assistant, tails her, pen and paper in hand. American calls for "er". Standard British is "re". So go for "er", unless you're a pompous American, then go for British. keeps negotiating the maze, leaving Rhoda in her wake. Theater. Last night. We were supposed to go, remember? stops at a desk where Merkin Burns, officious office assistant, is talking on the phone. He picks his nose with abandon as he talks, ignoring Josie.
	way. No way. No way. Ech, hold on.
	removes his finger from his nose and uses it to pick up a pink message. He holds it out to Josie. Disgusted, she takes it by one corner. No way. No way-- still standing there.
	do you think we could get some more yellow highlighters? I checked the box and we're-- swivels his chair 180 degrees so his back is to Josie and continues with his phone call. I'm back, so-- sighs, walks to her door. It's marked with a lopsided nameplate: Josie Geller, Copy Editor. She adjusts the plate so it's perfectly straight. enters, reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers, and drops it into the trash can. She hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door, takes five pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in her pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a row. She smiles, satisfied, ready for another day. who I did it with last night... in Op/Ed.
	told!
	did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him." that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure. just stares at her.
	it didn't happen for sure. Strauss, late 30's, would probably clean up well, enters. He tosses some copy onto Josie's desk. down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
	is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings. and Anita just stare at Josie. excuse me for caring about words. You and Roger in Op/Ed. man! Who told?
	in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating. office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
	what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can? flounces off.
	many times have I fired her?
	Six-- turns to exit.
	Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
	blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
	Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
	we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
	done five of my ideas.
	know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters? don't have to be in the office Christmas show? flack jacket.
	jacket.
	Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls. don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
	you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five. can be out of control. smiles. On his way out he re-adjusts Josie's nameplate so it hangs at an angle. Tormented, Josie waits a beat. She can't take it, and runs to the door and straightens it. by five. a pretty depressing kitchenette area. Anita and Josie eat lunch--Anita eats Chinese out of a container, Josie has three baggies of perfectly cut food in front of her.
	honest. Do you think I'm aggressive? ponders a moment. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
	stood for like a month. an affable African-American woman in her 40's, enters and puts three microwave meals in the microwave.
	because I'm not out of control doesn't mean I can't write.
	deep inside, don't let anyone tell you you're not. Look at me. Every day I come to this paper and I pour my heart and soul into what I do. I feel it, passionately, to the core of my being. write obituaries.
	if you can make a busted aorta sound good--honey, that's art. microwave dings off. Cynthia fishes the three Lean Cuisines out. Anita and Josie share a look.
	aren't they only diatetic if you eat them one at a time?
	eat 'em one at a time. maybe Gus has a point. It wouldn't kill you to relax and have some fun. Roger's got a friend, Marshall in editing? The one with the lazy eye? Maybe we could double date. it.
	swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date? concentrating on my career right now. you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
	
	You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexyÂ— you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye. laughs in spite of herself. right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him. but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
	I finally get kissed, I'll know. and Cynthia trade looks.
	If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
	kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
	thing"? Is that what you kids are calling it these days?
	thing. That moment. You kiss someone and it's like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this other person and you know that one person is the person you're meant to be kissing for the rest of your life. And for that one moment you've been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry at the same time because you're so lucky you found it, and so scared that it will all go away. and Cynthia take this in.
	girl. You are a writer. a Mailbox Etc. store, but dressed in a Tahitian theme. Cardboard hula dancers hold Fedex envelopes. Geller, 23, good-looking, wears a smock with "Tiki Post" emblazoned across it over a Hawaiian shirt. He stands watch at the cash register. Maylik, 50, proud owner, rearranges a display. The place is empty.
	Monty--you think we'll get any business today? handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
	think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
	is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
	thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time. walks into the store, triggering Hawaiian music. Monty puts a lei over her head. Welcome!
	Monty. It's just my sister. takes the lei off her neck. Josie hands Rob an envelope. Rob rifles through the cash inside. Jos. I'll pay you back. Bambi thanks you, too. indicates a beat-up wreck of a yellow car parked outside.
	is so--weird that you name your car.
	it's not. Guys name their penises. car's going to bankrupt you. just needs a new windshield wiper.
	I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do. hands the money back.
	what? Take it. I don't want it. hands it back.
	take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
	it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
	person than I.
	know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
	not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life. is a luau that sells packing material!
	this luau is going to be all mine!
	can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
	yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
	your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life! exits. The music starts up again.
	again! pan around the neatest and quietest walk-up you've ever seen. Lots of books on shelves. find Josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow. She turns it over and we see it says: "LOVE". She holds up the final product to a terrarium, lookup up at her two turtles.
	What d'you think, guys? Where should it go? looks around the living room. that? Bedroom? Great idea! walks into the bedroom with the pillow. perfectly arranged Laura Ashley bedroom. We pan over to the bed. It is completely covered in needlepoint pillows. Josie places the latest one on top of the others and smiles. packed with the NEWSPAPER STAFF. Hyram Rigfort, 65, white-haired, dignified owner of the paper presides. Anita and Josie sit next to each other. Next to Anita sits Roger from Op/Ed, a good-looking guy in his 30's.
	me start out by saying that I was very impressed by the investigative piece Dutton did on pesticides in our supermarkets. older man, Dutton, smiles proudly.
	since the Trib did a better piece on the same subject, you're fired. face falls. Everyone looks horrified. heard me. Out. Out. shuffles out. Josie takes a big bite of donut. Happy March everybody! March Mr. Rigfort.
	celebrate, I've decided it's time for another undercover feature! looks underwhelmed.
	all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience. Who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last month's award-winning expose -- "hair today, gone tomorrow"? Hat's off to you, Bruns. pan over to Bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in odd-looking clumps. He nods sadly.
	should I say "hat's on"! And what about when my wife had that affair with Gil, her ski instructor and Howard went undercover as an expert slalom skier. smiled wanly. Both his arms are in casts. Camera pans the room as Rigfort continues, picking out different reporters.
	last night I'm sitting around the dinner table with my family. The wife, the two nannies, the boys, and we're eating chicken with this peanut sauce. stops at a Chef Boyardee look-alike.
	chef. I like it.
	on, Gus. So, we're eating this peanut sauce and suddenly the younger kid starts choking. stops at a Nurse Ratchet look-alike. smelling undercover ER nurse. out he's allergic to peanuts. And I think -- holy shit. I don't even know my own kids. I mean, who knows if they're even mine? And it got me thinking. How much do we know about kids today? What are they thinking? How many of them are allergic to peanuts? Boom. It hit me -- "My Semester In High School." stops at a bald guy, the jerks over one seat to Josie. What's your name. Josie Geller.
	enroll on Friday. crowd hubub. Josie's in shock.
	But--I'm not a reporter yet...
	none of these geezers could pass for a day under 40. Have fun. Rigfort exits. is so excited she can hardly speak to Anita.
	finally happening, Anita! I'm going to write! looks concerned. own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
	- Maybe you should turn it down. beat. Josie's face falls.
	don't think I can do it.
	- It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin! enters.
	worry, I'll straighten all this out. I don't want it straightened out. this is way out of your league. takes in Anita and Gus. just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
	that's not what we're --
	when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs? looks down, chastened. Josie.
	Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles? did.
	knit?
	this is my chance. beat.
	not holding your job for you, Geller. jumps up and down and hugs Gus, who is clearly uncomfortable. make me send you the memo on hugging in the workplace. smiles. Gus exits.
	do believe in you, Jos. Anything you need, I'll help you out. sits, motions to the brown paper bag.
	can start by handing me that bag. does. Josie sticks it over her face, flips her head between her knees and starts hyperventilating again. up on Rob, wearing his Tiki Post outfit. He shakes his head. Uh, uh. shiny Buick is parked right behind Bambi at the curb. just for a couple of months. can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life! give you my Buick Le Sabre. rolls his eyes and enters the store.
	can name it whatever you want. follows Rob into the store. He turns.
	This must be big. got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school. starts laughing uncontrollably. you remember high school? was a long time ago - you remember what they called you? Josie's face falls. She looks very far away. - packed with kids. Everyone stares off-screen at chants -
	Grossie. Josie Grossie. Josie Grossie. looks stricken. Grossie. know. I came up with it. look nauseous.
	I look nauseated. Oh God. puts her hand over her mouth, races for the bathroom. has just gotten violently ill. She rises off her knees, grabs some toilet paper to wipe her mouth. She looks down at her feet. close up on brown leather oxfords and widen to reveal teenage JOSIE heavy glasses, in all her nerdom, slowly walking down the corridor with a huge backpack on her back. boy sneaks up behind her, holds open the top of her backpack while another boy pours a half drunk Sprite into her backback. smile and snicker as Josie continues down the hallway. She spots, Billy Prince, ultmate high school heartthrob, and approaches him nervously.
	Billy Prince, I noticed you weren't in math today, and I have the notes in case you want - stares into the mirror. Staring back is teenage Josie.
	is a very bad idea. and Josie cruise through a teen clothing store, carrying large bags from a stationery store. Josie picks up a platform sneaker and just stares at it.
	you were a geek. Big deal.
	remember espadrilles?
	That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
	girls threw them at me in the locker room.
	That's bad.
	the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool. mia. because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation. pulls a slip skirt off a rack and holds it up. this is cute. is lingerie.
	I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
	you feel when you kissed him?
	
	romantic. pulls out a plain button-down cardigan. about this? am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady. grabs an awful white maribou jacket and matching earrings and holds them up.
	
	this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
	we're going to have to do something about your hair.
	please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast! a bedside table. Surrounded by make-up, boxes of hair color, a stack of index cards, ripped magazine pages of teen looks, issues of Teen Beat and YM. The clock slips to 7:00. NPR starts playing. A hand reaches over, hits the radio off. SOUND EFFECTS: A school bell. As the bell continues to ring, we widen to: sits up in bed, covers pulled up to her chin in terror. UP: "Morning Train". Crowds of commuters stream down the sidewalk and onto the stairs leading up to the El. big yellow car jerks into frame, backfires noisily. It's Josie at the wheel of Bambi. She jerks out of frame. suburban campus anchored by a main building. Cars pull into the parking lot for the beginning of the day. Kids greet each other, converge on the front doors of the school. General mayhem. pulls in. She jerks into a spot, backfiring once more for effect. The entire scene stops. Kids freeze, look at Josie. A beat, and they they continue on their way. takes a few deep breaths.
	I can do this. Piece of cake. I can do this. steps out of the car wearing the maribou jacket, earrings, and white jeans. She shuts the door behing her, starts walking. She has unknowingly shut her jacket in the door and as she walks, a piece of maribou rips, trailing behind her like a tail.
	okay. Feeling good... merges with the throngs of kids and is literally pushed into the lobby. She stares around, overwhelmed. "Go Rams!" banners share space with signs that read: "63 DAYS TIL PROM!" She inches her way along the wall until she is stopped by a guard who grabs her arm.
	are you going?
	I'm a student. Most definitely a student. In high school. Here. I am going to class. With my fellow students. Hi there. guard stares at her a beat and then motions behind them, to three huge metal detectors that the kids are filtering through. Josie smiles, "whoops," walks back.
	stuff lays out on the post-detector table - cell phone, laptop, mini tape recorder, electronic organizer, pager, being scrutinized by the guard. Josie's sure she's been found out. Camera widens. Down from Josie, we see other kids' belongings spread out. They have the identical high-tech equipment. The guard picks up Josie's nail file, examines it -
	throws it in the trash. stares at her class card and eyes the classrooms, totally lost. She approaches a boy in a flannel shirt and loose jeans.
	I'm looking for Room 204, Ms. Knox? soon as the boy starts to talk, we notice something in his mouth - a tongue pierce. Josie does too. We zoom in on that shiny little metal ball. Josie is fixated. So fixated that we stop hearing the boy's voice. All we see is the mouth - and that ball - moving. The mouth closes. He's done. Josie's face is contorted in imagined pain.
	mean, wow. Wow. Great directions. Clear. Concise. Josie takes off, totally embarrassed. walks up to Room 204. Opening the door, she's met by a sea of faces. Knox, mid-forties, distracted but bubbly, sits in the front of the class. KNOX - hello. Wilkommen. Entre. walks in. Kids whisper and snicker.
	I'm late. KNOX well, I'm sorry I forgot to take my hot flash medication this morning. Josie, right? Please sit. Mi casa es su casa. makes her way to the desk, trailing maribou. The class titters. She sits in front of two girls, Kirsten and Kristen, beautiful and intimidating.
	is so sad --
	know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid. KNOX in my classroom, tardiness is unacceptable -- really sorry -- Knox pulls a ridiculously huge sombrero out from under her desk. The class laughs in recognition. KNOX as sorry as I am. Knox puts the sombrero on a less-than-thrilled Josie.
KNOX	Ten minutes in this hat, you'll never be late again. So, let's hear something about you. Stand up. Stand up. does. The sombrero drops over her eyes. She adjusts it so she can read her notecards. CLOSE UP on the notecard --it's filled with precise script under a heading: MY PAST. She scans it, then flips the cards face-down on the desk. Confidently she begins --
	name is Josie. I'm a high school student. I came from -- then the classroom door opens. We see from Josie's perspective a blinding light, Josie squints. From the light emerges a shadowy vision of Billy Prince. blinks, REVEAL not Billy, but a beautiful guy, Guy. He stands very close to her.
	from Billy-Bali. It's a suburb of Bali proper. pushes past her, tosses a wooden hall pass to Ms. Knox, and moves to his seat. KNOX Fascinating! What did your family do there? looks around in panic, sees a student in a South Glen South windbreaker with huge ram on the back.
	were--sheep--farmers. We raised sheep. In Billy-Bali. realizes the trouble she's gotten herself into. my God. my God--do I miss Billy-Bali. had--a really great...aquarium. sits. Defeated.
	to self--Research Bali. Kill Anita for picking out this outfit. Find and destroy sombrero. and her enormous bookbag enter. She takes a seat toward the back of the room. Kirsten and GIBBY, another beauty, enter and head to the back of the room. and Gibby stand over Josie, staring at her. sit here.
	Sorry--I didn't know these were assigned. not. quickly gathers her things and moves one row forward, next to two empty seats. TWO STONERS shuffle over to Josie.
1	We sit here.
	you two--sit there? Except there are three of us-- Stoners eye each other, then the two seats. A look of horror comes over Stoner 1. left Jed at the 7-11! picks up her stuff, moves to the last empty seat in the room-in the front row, surrounded by "Denominators" who all wear orange Denominator sweatshirts. next to Josie is ALDYS, a Denominator--intense, wise, with a whole bunch of math medals on her sweatshirt. She smiles at Josie. smiles back and looks up as MR. COULSON enters the room. He's a ruggedly handsome twenty-something Yale grad. grabs a notebook out of his bag, goes around to sit on the front of his desk, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup.
	everyone. don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
	Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie. smiles.
	since you're new--I love to drink my coffee during class, and since I allow myself to do this, I allow everyone to bring beverages to class as well. to Shakespeare's "As You Like It." How many of you actually read the assignment last night? five hands go up. bad. Now how many of you spent more than thirty minutes eating salty snack foods? hands. Sam laughs. If I could just get you guys to read while you eat. opens his book. Aldys notices Josie has no book. She moves next to her.
	We can share. share a smile. You Like It" is an example of a Shakespearean-- turns to the blackboard and starts writing. We CU on his butt, hardly discernable in his loose 501 jeans, all the girls swoon. Comedy. Anyone know what that means? enthusiastic, if slightly dim girl, SERA, waves her hand. oh oh! That's what they do to milk! pasteurize, Sera. But close. Same letter-- syllables-- a minute of my life I'll never get back. smiles at this. anyone else--- can't contain herself. means set in the country. Originally seen in the Eclogues of Virgil. It's from the Latin pascere. To graze. bleets like a sheep O.S. Sam just stares at her, smiling. Finally, he walks over and shakes her hand.
	I mention to the class that I love our new student? beams.
	I mention that the class also loves our new kiss ass? smile quickly fades.
	that's not exactly the kind of participation I'm looking for. looks right at Josie. Sorry. just sits there, face burning. approaches her locker. She can't get to it because a COUPLE is busy making out against it. GIRL'S VOICE comes over the loudspeaker. She's completely ignored. VOICE This is Sydney, Student Body President! Okay, first. Bad news-The' district didn't allocate enough funds, so as of this afternoon, there will be no music department. Now, about Prom-- entire hallway FREEZES. The couple breaks their clinch and looks up. SILENCE. Josie is amazed. VOICE on Prom theme has been completed. And the theme is-- on expectant FACES.
VOICE	Millennium! Kids cheer, gasp. One GIRL faints. crowd surges again. Josie, caught in the flow, doesn't notice a locker door flinging open. She smashes her face right into it. Everyone, including Guy, turns and laughs. Even some Denominators. A CAFETERIA TRAY down the food line. It's piled with unidentifiable foods and three glasses of fluorescent red punch. Hands pull the tray out of the frame. INTO FRAME comes another tray, this one bearing a perfectly arranged place setting with three celery sticks on a plate. WIDEN TO REVEAL: pulling the perfect tray down the cafeteria line. She reaches some awful-looking Cole slaw in a big vat. A CAFETERIA GUY in a plastic cap hovers above it.
	me. What's in the Cole slaw? cafeteria guy hauls an industrial-size plastic tub onto the, counter and turns it-so Josie can read the label: "KOLE SLAW FOOD." Josie wrinkles her nose. She moves on to the cash register.
	be twelve ninety-five.
	my gosh. Wow. That's... pricey. real meat in the ham sandwich. turns to a GIRL in line behind her.
	a lot of bread for that bread! Girl rolls her eyes, reaches past Josie to grab a mustard bottle. Josie turns with her tray toward the room.
	Grossie--Josie Grossie--Josie Grossie. BACK ON JOSIE. She's seventeen. Standing with her tray, paralyzed. The CAMERA SPINS, showing us her back. There, tattooed in squeeze-bottle mustard, is "GROSSIE." A boy stands behind her victoriously holding the mustard bottle. shakes off the vision and stares out at the crowded cafeteria. She sees Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, steels herself, and decides to approach. is eating a bran muffin. that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams. uh.
	I read this thing that one bran muffin can be like two bran muffins sometimes. pushes the muffin away. Food is so confusing. Kristen. Kirsten. plops herself down with these girls, and takes a spiral pad out of her big knapsack. In the process, she manages to spill her chocolate milk all over her white jeans. teach me to wear white after Labor Day. I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983. all laugh. Josie fakes a laugh, too. right. picks up her notepad and her pen. - tell me about yourselves. all just stare at Josie in disgust. Guy approaches their table.
	Guy. looks at Josie. He's beautiful. She's flustered.
	you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.
	you in special ed? stands up, grabs her bag and her chocolate milk- Guy. Others. leaves the Cafeteria, passing a-couple of Denominators. How old am I? #1 six thousand three hundred and fifty days old- subject to adjustment for month of birth. is very funny Denominator humor- to the Denominators. Josie leaves the Cafeteria. runs out an exit door and right into a SECURITY GUARD got a pass? banner above reads "PRESIDENTIAL FITNESS TESTING THIS WEEK." FIFTEEN SENIOR GIRLS, including Josie, in matching green and yellow polyester gym clothes do sprints up and-down the basketball court. Josie looks like she's about to die. Ms. Brown yells as she passes. BROWN it Geller! Move it! Move it! stops, grabs the woman by the shoulders.
	BROWN do I look like, your waitress? Now you're gonna complete these sprints, cause if you don't you fail. And if you fail gym, you're NEVER GETTING INTO COLLEGE! guys areÂ—still telling that lie--? BROWN it Geller--drop and give me twenty! drops to the gym floor. - finally- the end of the day. Josie makes her way down the hall, clutching her pad of paper, getting pushed and shoved by kids as they storm outside. A huge banner hangs overhead reading: "SIGN UP FOR SENIOR NIGHT!" tries to smile at some kids, but they all ignore her. makes it to the main entrance to the school, where we see, as she shoves her pad of paper into her bag, it is completely blank. fill the parking lot. Josie walks, talking on her cell phone.
	make sure Gus gets-the whole message, okay? Yeah--bye-- arrives where she parked Bambi. The space is empty. She still holds the phone to her ear-- a second-- not you--bye-- shuts the phone, looks around...retraces her steps ... Bambi is gone. walks around the lot, getting visibly upset. the corner of the lot, we see a group of Denominators removing a BIG METAL CHAIN from around a group of tightly packed cars. do it to all the new kids. finds Aldys standing next to her. of they? motions up to a second floor window. Guy and his Group look down on them, laughing.
	Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
	it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
	being named after a guitar-playing pussycat. doesn't get it. mind. is so awful that they hide your cars. guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now- points up to the biology room- still would not know the difference between a synecdoche and a hyperbole. laughs. know. It's pathetic. stares Josie down.
	
	do you?
	uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
	stop and look around. long will they watch us for? Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot. do they listen to Guy? he's Guy Perkins. you want to walk to Na-Na's and get something to eat? Let's do that. start to walk out of the parking lot. Josie is visibly thrilled - having finally found a friend. and Aldys share a huge plate of chili fries. - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know. I know. WAITER delivers two huge chocolate shakes.
	going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table. went to Northwestern! To use the bathroom. THE WINDOW, Josie sees her Buick with Rob at the wheel stopped at a red light. Detailed on to the side in big white script is: TIKI POST". Josie's eyes widen. The light changes. Rob pulls away. My. God. really like Northwestern. both slurp down their shakes. what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be? of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist. takes another slurp of her shake. WE HEAR a muffled cell phone RINGING.
	think your knapsack is ringing. takes the cell phone out of her knapsack and answers it. INTERCUT WITH: speaks into his phone, knitting frantically.
	I got your message. What the hell kind of story are you pitching?! smiles awkwardly at Aldys, covering the phone. my dad. He worries. Dad. I miss you too.
	a sick puppy, Geller. indicates to Aldys she'll be right back and walks to the back of the restaurant by the pay phones. an expose on cafeteria food.

The MARCHING BAND clumsily practices their formations around it. Josie and Aldys arrive at the car and Aldys pops the hood. love to disconnect the battery, too. looks under the hood, reconnects the battery. Slams the hood down.
	so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
	No problem. heads to the lot for her car, and then turns around.
	Josie, how are you at Calculus? good.
	would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year. we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other. smiles. MUSIC UP: SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK'S "Magic Three" WE BEGIN MONTAGE: and Denominators walk down the hallway in unison, past Guy's Group, open their lockers in order a la "RESERVOIR DOGS", take out paper, pencils, calculators. and Aldys, both wearing big orange Denominator sweatshirts, are behind a table manning a bake sale. banner behind them says: n = 3.14578697786978 Pie = $.75 one is stopping to buy anything. Josie points to the left, Aldys looks, and Josie stuffs a whole brownie in her mouth. They laugh uncontrollably as Josie starts to choke and cough up most of the brownie. Denominators erupt into cheers. They're jumping all over Josie, going crazy. As we go wider we see the gym is entirely empty, except for a handful of Denominators going crazy on one side, and a janitor sweeping up on the other. at each other, Josie and Aldys clutch books excitedly and stand in line. WE WIDEN to reveal they're in line with NERDY ADULTS also clutching their books. At the head of the line is a blow-up poster for The New Elements Of Grammar.

Can anyone tell me where we see that?
	Rosalind disguises herself as a man and escapes into the forest. And it's when she's in costume that she can finally express her love for Orlando. See, Shakespeare's making the point here that when we're disguised, we feel freer. We can do things we wouldn't do in ordinary life. on Josie's face. She's clearly uncomfortable. Sam walks up to a huge football player, BRETT. when you go out on the football field in your uniform, what happens?

One night I tried to walk up the side of the garage. you make it? the Emergency Room. Yeah. smiles at this, a little smitten. why don't you read from Act 5, Scene 2, Rosalind's speech-- stands up, starts reading-- sooner had they met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed..." voice begins to fade away- BACK to Josie, now seventeen and mortified, nervously standing in class and reading a poem. Billy Prince sits to the side--she glances at him throughout the poem, it's clearly about him.
	he notice me? Does he hear my heart screaming his name-- sometimes it's so loud I think the Gods can hear my pain. His voice is so mellifluous, oh to get just one small kiss. CLASS laughs at her except for Billy, who smiles at her, looking slightly touched. Josie is surrounded by an elaborate, color-coded index card system for her research paper. friend, SHEILA, over-weight and pimply, comes running across the library at breakneck speed. She sits down next to Josie, visibly excited and pushes her index cards aside.
	what have you wanted for like ever but you didn't think it would -ever happen? looks at her for a moment, mulling it over.
	they'd start an Olympic team for grammar - like diagramming sentences and verb declensions and stuff. And I'm scouted for the team- just as an alternate, of course- because I'm so young. But then there's talk of me in the '96 games- better. Something better smiles.

	what I'm saying. two girls look at each other. Big smiles erupt into screams, as they jump up and down, hugging each other. - The BELL RINGS. the end of class. Students pack their bags. - just a reminder. Your paper is due in one week. and Josie head out of class and down the hallway towards their lockers. Josie stops in front of hers where the Makeout Couple continues their clinch, blocking her locker. Josie pauses frustrated as Sydney's Voice comes over the loudspeaker. guys! Bad news--Chem wing is closed. The Hazardous Materials Crew is on the way. Now, about prom. entire hallway STOPS to listen. The makeout Couple stop making out. join a committee--because we are going to KICK NORTHGLEN'S BUTT and make millennium the best prom EVER! hallway erupts in CHEERS. Josie makes a move to go for her locker. The Makeout Couple are faster. They're back in their clinch, blocking Josie again. ON GUY with his group. Prom is gonna be Rufus. I made it up. Start using it. BACK ON JOSIE AND ALDYS.

	one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique-- this year's prom theme is--the millennium!

	I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
	I guess she hadn't completely given up hope. you sure you're seventeen? why? seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
	I'm definitely seventeen and definitely late-- she smiles and runs out. drives, Josie has shotgun and TYKE, Aldys' nine-year-old sister, is in back. They all hold double-scooped cones and they all sing FREE TO BE YOU AND ME at full voice.
	aren't you guys glad you took a break from that Denominator stuff. I mean, you shouldn't be spending your Saturday night studying the whole time.
	should be spending it thinking of how we can better serve your baby-sitting needs? pull up at a red light, next to an abandoned drive-in. Josie peers in, and sees a BIG GROUP OF KIDS, standing around a bonfire drinking beers, talking, a few making out. She opens her window, sticks her head out, and tries to get a better look.
	that?
	the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group. ON: Gibby and Kristen talking by a car. I wonder what they talk about.
	I know. mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die? ON: THE COOL GIRLS.
	It's lather, rinse, repeat. BACK ON: ALDYS AND JOSIE Guy pokes his head in, startling everyone.
	if it isn't Alpo. Coming out to sniff some hydrants? is frozen, but not Aldys.
	Guy, you on a little break from having an original thought? Ooops, I forgot, that's all the time. gets it, and laughs. Guy doesn't get it at all.
	guys aren't seriously trying to hang out at The Court?
	cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan. Where do I sign up? stay away from prom.
	I checked--this was still a free country.
	a land that I see, where the children are free- right in Aldys' face, leaning over Josie. Aldys starts to drive away. Guy keeps his head in the window while he runs alongside the car.
	geek, why don't you just go home and play with your calculator. Figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool. stops running, and the car continues down the street. seems a little shaken, Tyke continues singing.
	you ever wanted to go to The Court?
	you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame. is? it's lame. it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around? ON a newspaper headline: "THE COURT - SITE FOR PARTIES, DRUGS AND WEEKEND ARRESTS" - as Gus throws the newspaper down on his desk. sits across the desk from him. She reads the headline, looking very surprised.
	I am appalled. picks up the paper, and starts reading intently.
	so am I. I had no idea that these kids- let's see- turn to A14- tries to turn to A14, but Gus grabs the paper out of her hands in a rage. I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune. Right. angrily tries to fold the paper back 'up. He's having a hard time. Josie tries to help, but he yanks it away. Gus reads aloud from the newspaper.
	officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night." got a quote? looks up at Josie. urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
	you been there?
	no.
	you been to any parties?
	how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session-- looks like he may combust. He opens the newspaper, finds what he's looking for, and shoves it in Josie's face. It is a picture of all of the popular kids at Southglen- Kristen, Kirsten, Gibby, Guy- they are all posing for the picture at The Court, smiling and holding beers.
	is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
	I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this. points to the picture in the paper of the Popular Kids.

Your subject is plural. grabs her knapsack and does. runs through the bullpen, past Anita's cubicle. ROGER from op/ed enters. He and Anita smile flirtatiously. Roger from op/ed-- Anita from classifieds. We still on for tonight? course-- he leans in and kisses her. She pulls away, confused. A beat. Anita kisses him again. Nothing. what? No, I don't think we are on. I think I have to stay home. I'm staying home! I don't know what I'll do there, but I'm gonna do it. Alone! walks off.
	opens the door still dressed in his Tiki Post outfit. He takes one look at Josie and knows that things are not good. mom and dad here? They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn. shoves her way into the house. Rob follows. storms into the den, and plants herself on the sofa. She sees that Rob has been watching baseball on T.V., and she turns it off.
	can't do it. I thought I could. I can't. I give up--I'm never going to be a reporter. sits next to her on the couch. He looks up at the T.V.-, which is now off.
	you catch the score? gives him a look of death.
	I mean, no big whoop.
	can't do this. pulls the article out of her purse, and shoves it at Rob. He sees the picture of all the popular kids at The Court.
	girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
	insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
	is that impossible? eyes get teary.
	you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
	my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team. Please focus. puts his arm around her. you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore. you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
	on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it. that true?
	known fact. takes this in.
	don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story? desperately. if you quit you're no better than me. than I... the spirit! approaches the school. She's clearly made a new attempt at style- she's teetering on too-high platform shoes and showing a blending white midriff. No one pays much attention to her. What are you doing here?
	get in the van, Josie. surveillance wonderland meets seventies living room. Tape players and monitors share space with shag carpeting and a mini-fridge. Barry White PLAYS on a TAPE. George starts to wrap wire around Josie's waist. He pins a kid's plastic "captain's wings" onto her collar.
	is this?

	it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story. if I say no? bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece. Josie's look of concern... crush of kids flood up the stairs to the front door of the school. We see Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby walking three abreast ahead of Josie up the stairs. The Crowd parts around them. Josie heads towards them.
	Kirsten, Kristen, Gibby-- What's up girlfriends? three girls pause and turn just as Josie, caught up in the moment, doesn't see a stray backpack on the stairs in front of her. Josie trips and-- POV: CAMERA FACE-PLANTS into the pavement. watches the monitor, winces. POV: CAMERA still faces the pavement. okay. is standing, reading from her paper. Sam is rapt.
	so it is Rosalind, in disguise, who is best able to see through the disguises of others. To say to Phebe, "Mistress, know thy self," to look at love from every angle, and to realize, finally, that she is in love with Orlando-- BELL RINGS. Class is over. Josie puts her stuff away and starts to follow the Cool Girls out.

	no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college. just go right into sheep herding.
	you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
	you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words-- here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--" --and swallow whole." both take a breath in. Look away from each other. watches the monitor. oh. sits on Gus's desk, watches the last scene on Gus's TV, engrossed. Gus walks in and stops the tape. over! Move-it! Back to work! climbs off his desk.
	have you ever been in love?

	should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you. stares down at his tie. But he's smiling--a little. away. I have enough work here to last me all night. I don't have any plans--you want some help? Roger from op/ed? share a smile. walks toward her locker, the Make out Couple is at it again. Josie's fed up. She taps the Boy on his shoulder.
	me. Hi. Do you guys have some kind of schedule I could work around? ignores Josie and goes back to his Girlfriend. in her Denominator sweatshirt decorated with pins, approaches Josie. where's your sweatshirt?
	Â– uhh, must have forgotten-
	biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you. starts to leave.
	Â– I almost forgot Â– I'll see you tonight at Big Cup. 7:30, right? looks confused.

	is gonna be such a sweet show. I am so there. looks at Tommy and Jason, who f follow his lead. yeah, man, I'll drive. gonna be Rufalicious. using it wrong. head off, en masse. Josie goes and looks at the flyer: "JIMMY CLIFF TONIGHT AT DELLOSER HALL". Josie smiles. reads "Jimmy Cliff." A crowd has gathered by the door. Josie gets out of cab, and walks towards the club. enters the small, smoky club. She wears what she considers to be her "hip concert outfit," an outfit that completely clashes with the Rasta wear of the other concert goers. -She reaches the BOUNCER.
	Drinking? notices the two Stoners from school standing behind her in line.

	right, sorry. Lara--Josie. Josie--Lara. a student of mine. my-date.
	to meet you. awkward pause.
	c'mon, let's go dance. crowd roars over Cliff's next song as Lara drags San off into the crowd. Sam looks back briefly at Josie as we lose him into the crowd. ON JOSIE sees Guy's group sitting at a table and approaches an empty seat. They immediately scoot around so that the seat is taken. Undeterred, Josie sees a seat at the next table and sits down in it. She looks up to see that she is at a table of huge RASTAFARIANS. They all wear big Rasta hats and even bigger hair and are smoking a joint the size of Cuba. She smiles awkwardly.
	Is it okay if I sit here?
#1	ya mon. We accept all peoples. We are all about da' love. and the Rasta's start to groove to the music. Josie looks over at Guy's table, sees they are toking off a small joint and passing it around. and his DATE, a Pam Grier look-alike, sit close on the couch, grooving to the CONCERT PLAYING on the monitor and through the various speakers. CU on the monitor. POV: joint the size of Cuba is passed into frame. Josie's hand takes it. Catching sight of this, George and his Date exchange concerned looks. is high beyond belief, wearing a big Rasta hat and loudly laughing her ass off as the Rastas just stare. She can hardly keep herself in her chair.

Then Josie hears the first strains of "The Harder They Come"-- my God! This music rules! Josie proceeds to get up and take over the place--she's dancing on the table, getting up with the band and playing the bongos, all with absolutely no rhythm or style. But with a lot of whooping. The club is agog. ON: Lara and Sam. They both look aghast. a student of yours?

CLOSE UP ON her forehead. There in block letters backwards is "LOSER". looks up at the clock, which reads: 8:30. She's late. Very late. She grabs her book bag and her keys, and races out. strides confidently down the hallway, LOSER prominently on her forehead. She sees Guy and his Group.
	Guy. Guys. Guy's Guys. stare, then snicker. loser. group laughs and joins in, saying "Hey Loser." Josie's face registers confusion.

George can now see Josie reflected in the bathroom mirror. He sees the "LOSER" stamp on her forehead.

She's trying her best to keep her game face on. The CARNY opens the gate, the Kids pile onto the ride, two by two. Josie reaches an empty car--the last one--and gets in. The Carny holds the safety bar open.

	shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher. look at each other, their smiles fading into realization. Suddenly, the car jerks, and they start to move down. Josie and Sam are pulled out of their reverie. They smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small laugh. Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought. are you going to open your eyes? thinking when I'm home. sits with a bunch of BASEBALL PLAYERS. MATZ and PACKER, the studs of the team, come into the dugout and join them. Hey Rob, thanks for showing me that new grip. It totally changed my swing.

Aldys, y'know, I have to-- Josie walks over to Guy's table, leaving Aldys staring after her. Josie sits down at the table. Everyone stares at her. Josie. It's Josie, right?
	I just say--I totally love Ex-Lax.
	that's good to know--
	can't believe you dated Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. shoots a look at Rob.
	I told you--Josie doesn't like to talk about that. Tommy, that's totally gochay. think it's pronounced gauche. it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft. silent beat. Josie thinks she may have blown it.
	of course you would know that. From being on your yacht in the south of France. all smile at her. Josie soaks in her newfound popularity. the walls are SAFE SEX posters. On the front desk, pamphlets on sexually transmitted diseases share space with plastic biology cross-section models of male and female reproductive organs.

But the burning is totally normal. look. Class is over already. thought this was a 45-minute seminar. Right. walks back to the front of the classroom. sex. Let's see. Sex is really fun. you're old enough. Which none of you are, trust me I should know cuz when you lose it to some guy named Junior with really bad breath in the back of a van at a Guns and Roses concert you're gonna wish you listened to your Mom when she said, y'know, no one's gonna want to buy the whole friggin ice cream truck when you're handing out the popsicles for free. Any questions? Kids all have bananas and condoms. They are in various stages of putting the condom over the banana. Anita walks among them, clearly more comfortable with her role now. I know it's hard. from the group. But safe sex is really important. I try to practice it every day. reacts. ON KIRSTEN & KRISTEN. Their condoms are snugly on their bananas. They stare at Josie. rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different. opposites attract. Look at Bert and Ernie. ANGLE ON ANITA. She's walking authoritatively up the aisle towards the front.

She snorts. a land called "every man's fantasy". looks up, sees the real MISS KITTERMAN can tell from the model of a uterus she carries), standing outside the door and waving. Without missing a beat, Anita pulls down a shade on the door and locks it. ON: JOSIE AND TRACY still struggling with condoms.
	I can't do this.
	because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas. know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person. ON SAM, listening. Josie is oblivious.
	know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
	I'm not a penguin. an analogy. surprised Josie looks up to see Sam next to her. She lets her condom go. And it flies off her banana into his face. Josie turns to Tracy. me. I have to go die now. class is interrupted by Sydney over the loudspeaker: guys--Sydney again! Don't forget--No going into the library cuz of that little asbestos problem. And about promÂ— freezes. Dead silence. bad news. We just got the word from intelligence-- Northglen High is doing the Millennium too! chaos. SCREAMING terror. A GIRL faints. Sera squeezes her banana so hard it oozes out of its skin. Other KIDS are beating their bananas against desktops. Brett, the football player, absentmindedly peels his banana and begins eating it.
	right guys, let's calm down. Calm down. all do, including Anita. look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea. How about "Under the Sea?" met with a round of "boos". Anita reacts. excuse me. about the "Roaring Twenties"Â… or "The 80's"? Class lets out a GIANT GROAN on that one.

	Josie will have the answer. long beat. Expectant faces all turn to Josie. She looks at Tracy. about--' for each other--Famous couples throughout history? beat as the Class considers.
	That's it. Class suddenly CONCURS. /That's it. /Rufus. soaks in all the approval like a sponge.
	Thank you. looks from Sam and Anita's smiling faces to find Guy smiling at her. UP ON A BANNER reading: "MILLENNIUM". It comes down, replaced by one that reads: "MEANT FOR EACH OTHER... WIDEN TO REVEAL: and the Cool Girls walk under the banner, laughing. We PAN UP to their lapels and see that they are all wearing replicas of Josie-'s geeky airplane pin. They pass Aldys, Josie is oblivious. and the Girls walk four abreast, like a pack of proud lions. Kids part to let them through. look at their watches, run into Gus's office. and Josie have fun painting a backdrop of the sunset. stand around Gus's TV, riveted by Josie and Sam. and the Girls try on lipstick, laughing and fooling around. and Sam pick out CDs from a DJ's case. Josie picks one out and puts it in the "yes" pile. Sam picks it up, wrinkles his nose, puts it back. When he looks away, Josie sneaks it back. hiding behind a rack of clothes, talking on her cell phone.
	telling you Gus. It's a great story. They keep the tags on, then return the clothes after they've worn them. discovers Josie behind the rack. Josie quickly pulls a cardigan off a rack, feigning interest in it. The Girls all do the same. and the Girls, wearing matching cardigans, walk past Aldys and another Denominator on their way to the escalator. Josie and Aldys lock eyes and Josie smiles but Aldys turns her back to her.
	there goes another Lemming. ANGLE ON the escalator as Josie and the Girls rise single file out of- FRAME. sits with her new friends, emulating them by sunning in a bikini top and shorts while they watch the game.
	you have totally transitioned.

	Kirsten transitioned last year. dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures. Do you know any gay guys?
	
	love to transition a gay guy into the group. very evolved. THE FIELD BALL sails fast and hard. It looks like it's going to be a base hit, into left Field, but the shortstop leaps up and grabs it. That shortstop is Rob. The Team cheers. Coach Romano heads out of the dugout towards Rob. THE STANDS and the Gang leap up and cheer. Josie almost loses her top, but catches it, just as Guy comes around the side of the stands and notices Josie. Romano approaches Rob. Slaps him on the back.
ROMANO	playing, Rob. You might be just what Southglen South needs to get to Nationals. playing in the championship game? ROMANO You're starting shortstop. And I don't mean to put more pressure on you but there are going to be some pro scouts there. man! grabs Coach Romano in a bear hug. The Coach is uncomfortable. Rob moves towards the dugout and the Coach happily slaps him on the ass. and the Girls are leaving. Guy catches up to them and taps Josie on the shoulder.
	going to the party at Rob's? taken aback. The Girls notice Guy's interest. you gonna be there? stumbles on a step Guy immediately reaches out to steady her. She melts. She can't even speak, so she just nods.
	I'll see you tonight. walks off. is totally crunching on you.
	I want to be crunched? Guy? yeah. PANS the faces of some dull-looking workers. It stops on Josie, who stands out in her teen garb and huge knapsack. A star struck female WORKER turns to her. really loved you in the sex-ed scene. reacts. spills out the elevator and races through the bullpen with Rhoda in pursuit.
	stops, turns back to her.
	keeps going. A confused Rhoda stares after her. She passes Merkin's desk. He is still on the phone.
	way ... Yeah? ... No way. reaches over, grabs the phone out of his hand and hangs up without missing a beat. She continues on as Merkin stares after her. Josie reaches the conference room door. An older WOMAN runs out crying. presides over a staff meeting. CLOSE UP on stunned office WORKERS' faces. then--next on the agenda-sack races at the company picnic-yes or no? sneaks in. She pushes past workers to get to a chair, big backpack whacking them as she goes.
	Sorry I'm late. Excuse me-- takes the chair next to Anita's. Anita looks her up and down. love that jacket. Geller, what's the status on your story? it's great. Totally Rufus. and Anita look at each other, both mouthing "Rufus?" have, um-- dumps out her backpack on the table. Teen items spill out-notebooks, CDs, barrettes, a hacky sac, a Frisbee, glitter nail polish. She rifles through it all--
	my math homework!
	I don't need your notes. I need your story. Though I speak for everyone when I say I've seen the tapes. Compelling stuff. the workers nod in agreement.
	I want a story in two weeks. I'm saving the "Life and Style" cover for you. You're gonna make one hell of a reporter. Oh, and if you don't, you and Gus are fired. and Gus react. onto the next order of business. Marketing department-yes or no? cans and kids litter the lawn. Josie pulls into the driveway. makes her way through the THRONGS OF KIDS. It's a big high school "rager" lots of big blue keg cups, drunk girls, etc. The cool Girls are present and socializing. Josie finally makes her way to the kitchen. is mixing margaritas, wearing a big sombrero. Tracy sits on the counter, gazing lovingly at Rob's every move.
	Rob, what's going on?
	Rob's prom date. glares at Rob.

It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame. starts to giggle. Rob does not. and Josie stand in front of Josie's old room. A bicycle license plate that says-"JOSIE" is nailed to the door. She stands in front of it.
	we should go in a different room?
	already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there. reaches for the doorknob. go in. Josie sees her spelling bee trophies- with her name. She turns them around, trying to appear nonchalant. As Guy enters, he eyes the trophies, the stuffed animals, the many sets of encyclopedias.
	Rob's sister must be such a loser. manages a weak smile. Guy sits on the bed.
	here, sit down. sits on the bed, and then sees a picture of her and her family on the bedside table. She dives across the bed to overturn it.
	sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
	I'll go. Yes. leans in as if to kiss her and whispers... I don't even know where you live.
	know what? Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
	I'll catch you later. leaves. Josie is ecstatic and flops back on her bed. Stuffed animals fall all around her. and Rob walk confidently through the hallway. Kids greet and high five them both. Jos. Hey Robster. good guys.
	Jos. Rob, rufus kegger. and Josie turn the corner.
	this is unbelievable. I mean-- shoves through the double doors leading into the gym. place is a flurry of activity, a staging area for prom. Various committees are set up at tables throughout the room. and Rob enter.

	you. they move off. Rob spots Tracy and moves off to her. always liked Betty better. turns, sees Sam.
	did? they begin to walk through the prom prop area, and it begins to appear like a romantic date--they pass flowers, he picks one out, they pass a bistro table, a backdrop of a sunset follows them for awhile, etc. yeah. Betty was so spunky and fun. Veronica may have had great legs, but she was too moody. Very high maintenance. laughs. ON: A TABLE where Kristen and Tommy are selling prom tickets. Aldys is standing in front of them.
	can't not sell me a ticket to prom.
	Alpo--we can do whatever we want.
	I get it. It's that pesky making change part that's confusing you guys. Here. I'll make it easy. takes her ticket, walks off. Tommy and Kristen turn to each other and start whispering conspiratorially. BACK ON: JOSIE AND SAM runs up to Josie.

	really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.

	my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
	But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
	I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you. told him I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
	You believe in me that much--
	course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story. they share a meaningful look, WE FREEZE FRAME. and Josie sit in front of his TV. The image of Sam and Josie is frozen on the screen.

She looks over at her dresser where she eyes the camera/flight wings pin tentatively. in boxers, a dress shirt, and socks is filling flasks with vodka. Josie comes in the door wearing a lovely Elizabethan gown. She looks absolutely beautiful.
	Josie- you look really-
	Exactly. Major Rufus.
	And what are -
	Tom Cruise. "Risky Business". puts on his black wayfarer sunglasses, and does the famous slide into the living room. Josie laughs.
	For everything. This is really happening. I never thought-- know. smiles and exits. nervously checks her reflection in the T.V. - just like she did eight years ago. She takes a deep breath, and goes out. comes out on the porch, and sees the limo rounding the corner, just like eight years before. The sunroof opens. And Guy stands up - holding something. panics - and starts to take cover - but then sees he's holding a dozen white roses. And holding them out to her.
	on beautiful - what are you waiting for? smiling, runs down the driveway to the limo. night. And it really is magical. Twinkling lights dot the trees, MUSIC wafts out from the club. A neon sign that says "Meant For Each Other" blinks above the building.- COUPLES make their way inside. We see MORK a MINDY, ANTONY a CLEOPATRA and Sera dressed as a RABBIT. Annoyed, she turns back to her lagging date, Brett, dressed as a TORTOISE.
	If you don't hurry up we're gonna miss the whole thing! Kirsten, and Kristen exit limos with their DATES. They all wear the same straight blonde wig, and look at each other in horror. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea. uh. I'm Disco Barbie. wearing a short, tight miniskirt.
	I'm Evening Gown Barbie. That's not an evening gown. is on Barbie. and Guy approach, dressed in Elizabethan costume. They look great. you look Rufus.

	I get to have a sword! they all ooh and ahh. FOLLOW Josie and the group into the prom. The place looks amazing. Lights, ice sculptures, champagne fountains. WE PAN DOWN the buffet. BOY dressed as a jar of PEANUT BUTTER and his date, JELLY, are getting food. Peanut Butter turns away from the buffet and bumps into a GIRL dressed as a CHOCOLATE BAR. BUTTER sorry. a magical beat as they smile at each other. BAR okay-- looks on, chagrined. reach two OLDER GENTLEMEN in tuxes who carry clipboards and wear big buttons that read: NATIONAL PROM JUDGE. They contemplate the ice sculpture. #1 deft and unique without being derivative. #2 Pigs in blankets! he runs off. sits with the COOL GROUP at a table. Kristen is making odd faces.

	yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her. are lit. George's Date sits on the couch. The monitor is on showing the JOSIE CAM POV. flips the switch, the lights dim and a small disco ball starts moving slowly. George settles in next to his Date. entire office is crammed into Gus's office. Anita sits up front, spellbound, watching the JOSIE CAM. Gus stands in back. Okay, he's a little interested too.

	I miss the crowning?
	but I'm closing the pool in five minutes. holds out a bowl of cash.
	odds are 3 to 1. 2 to 1 for Prom court. And even odds the kid sticks himself with the sword by the end of the night. PAN ACROSS the dance floor where we see POPEYE & OLIVE OYL, SONNY & CHER, the BLUES BROTHERS. HOLD on ROBIN dancing with BATGIRL. BATMAN approached and taps Robin's shoulder-- I have this dance- Batgirl steps aside--Robin and Batman dance happily away. ON ROB trying to slow dance with Tracy

	Gibby gave me champagne.

	I've - I've thought about it a lot. And I think- I mean, I know. You're the one. My penguin. looks at her. She's young. She's beautiful. She's tipsy. She's trying to put her legs behind her head.

	I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex. looks around. It's high school prom. A skinny kid is getting beat up in a corner. Other kids are sneaking smokes. He can't do this.
	gonna get you some water. And then, I think we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie. gets up, kisses Tracy on the top of her head, and heads for the refreshment table. Tracy, her leg still around her head falls backwards into Kermit's lap. Kermit looks down, surprised and interested. Miss Piggy notices, gives him a big "Harumph", tosses her hair, and leaves. BACK ON: THE COOL TABLE. is staring O.S. in horror.
	guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
	you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen? I say that out loud? FOLLOW Kristen's stare to the prom entrance where Aldys and the Denominators enter in pairs, one behind the other, attached together with rope, to form a human ladder. They cross the dance floor, interrupting everything with their unwieldy, tied-together conga line. They approach the Cool Table.
	what are you supposed to be? Other than freaks?
	DNA. A double helix. But I guess you'd know that if you'd actually passed bio. reaches out and touches the rope binding Denominator #1 to Aldys. Denominator #1 slaps her hand away. #1 don't touch the hydrogen.

And the princes are Mr. Thomas Salamey, Mr. Jason Way, and Mr. Rob - looks at the card, and then looks around. Nobody can help him. Rob ... Mr. Rob! crowd cheers. Gibby, Kirsten, and Kristen all jump in preplanned delight. Rob seems genuinely surprised. Jason carries Tommy up to the stage piggyback. The girls make their way to the stage, and put on their "PROM COURT" sashes. Sam looks to the card again.
	up - Southglen's Prom KingÂ… is already halfway to the stage- Perkins! crowd goes wild. Guy reaches the stage and takes his crown and scepter.
	- this year's prom queen - looks at the card, then at Josie. Josie is standing; eyes open, staring at the podium... Crowd is rapt, waiting for the announcement. Anita has her eyes squeezed shut, praying for the win...
	and gentlemen Â– Josie Geller! Crowd CHEERS like crazy, Josie smiles. Crowd goes crazy, hugging each other and jumping up and down.
	You go girl! Yes! Yes! gives Gus a big hug. Gus is completely taken aback. Merkin dolefully hands out money. is hugged and congratulated as she makes her way, elated, to the stage. Sam places the Queen's tiara on her head and hands her a bouquet of flowers. They lock eyes for a moment. now - as it is custom - the king and queen will have their first dance. THE DANCE FLOOR: and Josie begin to dance. From Josie's P.O.V., it's in SLOW MOTION, the world glittering and wonderful around her.
	are you thinking about?
	How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold". about you? What are you thinking about?

You rock my world. said that already. stands by the buffet in her tiara, turns and comes face to face with Sam. They're both taken aback by the other's beauty. make a really beautiful prom queen.

	listen--it's prom. How about we let all the old shit go. Would you like to dance? can't help it. She smiles, a little flattered.
	it's okay with the rest of the double helix. smiles and unhooks herself from the group. And starts to dance with Guy. ON: JOSIE AND SAM as they continue to dance.
	always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
	are you here with anybody?
	I'm alone. weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you? smiles at this.
	amazing, Josie Geller. ON: GUY AND ALDYS as they dance, WE SEE the Cool Girls and Jason standing to the side of the dance floor laughing Gibby reaches into her purse and pulls out a CAN OF ALPO. She hands it to Jason who pulls a CAN OPENER out of his pocket, opens the lid. He hands it to Kirsten who take the lid off. She hands the can to Kristen, who hands the can to Tommy.
	you thought anymore about Dartmouth?

	him what?! Tell him what?! looks deep into Josie's eyes. something I have to tell you, too-- eyes shift from Sam to over his shoulder. She spots Aldys, who smiles at her. Josie's eyes travel up to the can of DOG FOOD. TEENAGE JOSIE the porch, facing Billy and his Date. TEENAGE JOSIE egg dripping all over her. TO PRESENT.
	MOTION as Josie lunges for Aldys and pulls her to floor as Tommy, off-balance, dumps the dog food all down Guy's front. The Crowd stops dead, staring. The can, now empty, rolls slowly off the dance floor, the metal rolling noise ECHOING in the silence.

	ruined the whole thing! so do not deserve to be prom queen. is still staring. It's dead quiet. me tell you something. is still silent. Josie takes a deep breath, and looks around the room. don't care about being the prom queen. I am twenty five years old. of confusion and teenage disgust. Rob is pissed.

She's on a roll. want to tell you something. You people- Guy, Gibby, the rest of you who have been keeping the geeks down through the ages. You will spend your lives trying to figure out ways to keep others down, because it makes you feel more important. And you will miss out on so much. her, huh? What did she ever do to you? Let me tell you something about this girl. She is unbelievable. I was new here, and she befriended me- no questions asked. But you people, you were my friends only after my brother, Rob... points out Rob in the crowd. He's mortified.
	as a student and told you to like me. But y'know--l have to thank you. I got to go to an amazing prom. I got to be prom queen. I got to be cool. It felt good. not as good as being myself. to all of you-- there's a big world out there. Bigger than prom. Bigger than high school. When you get there, it won't matter if you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school. What matters is that you don't regret who you were, who you are-What if Steven Spielberg had quit the audio/visual club because it wasn't "cool"? What if Rosie O'Donnell had stopped cracking jokes because someone told her they were stupid? What if Michael Jordan never went back to basketball after he got cut from his high school team?. this room right now, there could be a future Nobel Prize winner, a Supreme Court Justice, an amazing Mom. Find out who you are and don't be afraid of it. if you'll all excuse me, I have some business to take care of. shots' all around. Kids start clapping, hollering, whooping. The MUSIC STARTS UP again. They all go back to dancing The Denominators lead their own conga line. ON: JOSIE looks around for Sam but he is gone. She runs out, brushing past the Judges. ON: JUDGES #2 dabs his eyes.

What happened with Coulson? Gus is going crazy! of the shadows emerges Sam. The look on his face says he just heard everything. shakes his head in disbelief and walks off. Josie chases after him. He turns back to her.
	you were doing a story on me?!
	surprise, I thought you'd be-- Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
	were attracted to me?
	Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical. I was going to tell you--
	set me up. For a story. know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you. now you don't have to-- I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
	did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
	person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
	don't! Look, you could get to know me, again. turns and starts to walk away.
	Please don't walk away. just can't look at you the same way. gets into his car and drives off. Josie is devastated. still in the prom dress, rounds the corner of her apartment hallway and sees Rob, still in his Risky Business get-up, slumped in front of the door.
	finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay. gets up. He's not happy.
	not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age. wasn't even thinking about-
	you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys? shut up, Josie. Just shut up. storms off. lies amidst the needlepoint pillows, still in her prom costume. She stares blankly at the ceiling. slaps a newspaper down on his desk. ON - the front page of the paper, and not just any newspaper - THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE - the Sun Times' rival. is a PHOTO of Josie from Prom with the headline that reads: "REPORTER REVEALED AT LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL". picks it up, and starts reading.

	Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
	but I'm okay. I've got some work to do. need my help? thanks--I'm doing this on my own. walks past Merkin's desk. She holds out her hand to Merkin.
	Highlighter. slaps a highlighter into her hand, she continues on. Anita watches her go. looking quite the professional in stylish pantsuit and briefcase, bounds up the steps, two at a time. walks down the hall, purposefully - she is on a mission. Groups of kids stop and stare at her, but this time, Josie doesn't even notice. Josie rounds a corner, she comes face to face with Guy, who is at his locker. He looks at her. She smiles. And now it is Guy that is nervous. He drops a pile of papers, tries awkwardly to gather them. Josie looks at him - and for the first time we see it register on her face - this guy is just a seventeen- year-old kid.
	hey, umm--Ms. Geller. This is totally embarrassing but my mom, she's all worried about me getting a job after graduation. She wanted me to ask you about like, an internship for me, at the Sun Times? smiles big.

COVER UP WHAT YOU DON'T WANT SEEN! with that Josie comes walking into the locker room, completely unruffled, and storms over to Coach Romano's office, just as he is leaving it. Coach Romano, my name is Josie Geller, from the Chicago Sun Times Listen, you know the local sports guy for the Sun Times, Jim Lakin? every coach in the area tries to get Jim to cover his team. puts her arm around the coach, and leads him back into his own office.
	what would you say if I told you that I could guarantee that Jim and every other reporter in the area would be at the game?
	say you can have whatever the hell you want. smiles, together they enter his office and close the door. sits at her disk, typing on her laptop, engrossed. once told me that to write well you have to write what you know. This is what I know. I am twenty five years old. I have never really kissed a guy. A geek to the core, most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the teacher. comes in, snaps on the light, sits at his desk, and opens his newspaper. He pulls out, the "Life and Style" section. there it is. Front page - "NEVER BEEN KISSED BY JOSIE GELLER." There are three pictures next to the article. One is Josie at age 17, one is her recent prom picture, and one is her as a normal, 25 yr. old adult. school was more of the same. Then, at seventeen, it seemed as if my luck was about to change. The cutest guy in school asked me to senior prom - but it turned out he invited me as a cruel joke. I have never fully recovered. and Cynthia read the article, in the staff lunch room, over a shared bag of microwave popcorn. They are astounded- it is embarrassing to share this with the world. But it would be hard to explain what I learned, and how I learned it, without sharing this humiliating history. Sun Times lies on the front mat. The door opens; we see a pair of bare feet. A hand reaches down to grab the paper. WE PAN UP to reveal Sam in all his depressed glory--sweats, unshaven, bleary eyed.
(V.O.)	received an assignment, my first as a reporter, to enroll in high school as a student, to gain some insight into kids today. Understandably, returning to high school was my worst nightmare. shuts the door. stream into school. I found? Knox, wearing the sombrero, teaches her class. still that one teacher, who marches to her own drummer- in the back row, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby are laughing an talking-- girls are still there. The ones that, even as you grow up, will still be the most beautiful girls that you've ever seen close up. BASEBALL TEAM as they practice- athletes - and the immense sense of fraternity and loyalty that they share- and the Denominators- making smores over a bunson burner getting into a melted chocolate and marshmallow fight- and laughing hysterically- smart kids. Who everyone else always knew as the brains. But who I just knew as my soulmates, my teachers, my friends. Tommy and Jason, as they get out Guy's car, in the parking lot- there's still that one guy, the one who is so perfect in every way, from the muscles in his shoulders- focus in on Guy, as he takes the front steps two at a time- to the way he, in his own way, struggles to uphold tradition. Southglen would not have been the same without him. High school would not be the same without him. I would not have been the same without him. his buddies, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, sign yearbooks, hang out by the lockers- of these things made me miserable at seventeen. But at twenty five I finally see that this - all of this- is just the way it should be. It is all part of this thing- high school. A time in our lives that we can never truly repeat. A time that shapes us. A time that makes us who we are, for years to come. grab Chicago Sun Times at the newsstand- school- going through it the first time- helped make me who I am. But going there a second time made me see that who I am is O.K.

This is the article I needed to write. I lived a lifetime of regret after my first high school experience, and now, after my second, my regrets are down to one. kitchen of a depressed guy--empty pizza boxes next to a dying plant. Sam pours milk into a bowl of Lucky Charms while he reads the Sports Section of the paper. certain teacher was trampled in my path to self-discovery, and though this article may serve as a step, it in no way makes up for what I did to him. not paying attention and the milk overflows the bowl, soaking the table. this man, you know who you are, I am so sorry. takes the wet paper, using it like a sponge, he sops up the remaining milk, and throws the paper into an open trash can. He leaves the kitchen. WE HOLD ON the empty room. I would like to add one more thing - I think I am in love with you. begin to fill the parking lot in a steady stream. so I propose this - as an ending to this article, and, perhaps, as an ending to this portion of my life. I, Josie Geller, will be at the State Championship baseball game Â– where my friends the Southglen Rams are playing for the title. Southglen Rams baseball team minus Rob, are on the field, warming up. will stand on the pitcher's mound for the five minutes prior to the first pitch. If this man accepts my apology, I ask him to come to kiss me, in front of everyone, for my first real kiss. find a nervous looking Josie standing in the dugout.
	minutes may seem like a short time, but trust me, when you've been waiting twenty-five years, it's usually the last five minutes that kill you. THE PICTURE TAKEN OF JOSIE AND SAM AT THE PROM. went back to high school and discovered I was a loser, again. TO REVEAL the picture on the fridge in-- enters, still in sweats, carrying a book. He opens the fridge, grabs a beer, shuts it, is confronted by Josie's picture. He takes it down, looks at it. then I discovered it wasn't so bad. I wasn't so bad. So, now that I'm ready to start living the rest of my life, it would be magical if I could live the rest of it with him. lets the photo slowly drop from his hand into the trash. inside everyone is a loser afraid to be loved, and out there is the one person who can kiss us and make it all better.
